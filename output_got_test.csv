4,,,,Unproven,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/muffin-man-song-serial-killer/,The nursery rhyme “The Muffin Man” was inspired by a real 16th-century serial killer.,12 02 2021,snopes,,"The popular nursery rhyme “The Muffin Man” supposedly originated as a caution to children, warning them to beware of a 16th-century baker-turned-serial-killer who enticed his young victims by pulling a muffin down the cobblestone streets of London with a string.At least, that’s one version of the origin story.In a widely shared TikTok video posted on Jan. 16, 2021, self-described “CEO of History” Jack Williamson claimed that the song originated as a warning to children to avoid England’s first known serial killer. At the time of this publication, the video had been shared more than 8,700 times.TikTok video“So, as you might have already learned, the muffin man was indeed a serial killer. He killed 15 children and seven rival pastry chefs,” said Williamson in the recording.“His name was Frederick Thomas Lynwood and the children’s song was made to warn small children and to help small children identify his MO so that they can report him to authorities.” @jackglitchedOn a string huh? #serialkillertiktok #serialkiller #muffinman #shrek #truecrime #ssdgm ♬ original sound – Jack Williamson  @jackglitchedOn a string huh? #serialkillertiktok #serialkiller #muffinman #shrek #truecrime #ssdgm ♬ original sound – Jack Williamson @jackglitchedOn a string huh? #serialkillertiktok #serialkiller #muffinman #shrek #truecrime #ssdgm#serialkillertiktok#serialkiller#muffinman#shrek#truecrime#ssdgm ♬ original sound – Jack Williamson ♬ original sound – Jack Williamson But we found no records documenting murders committed by a man of that name, or that he even existed. Williamson did not note his sources, and our own search of the internet returned no legitimate results. As such, we rate this claim as “Unproven.”It appears that the account Williamson gave was based on an entry posted to Uncyclopedia, a parody version of Wikipedia. According to the comedic online encyclopedia, Lynwood also went by the nickname of “Drury Lane Dicer” and was known as England’s first documented serial killer. A quick look at the entry showed a mug shot of the alleged “Muffin Man” — but of course cameras, photography, and mug shots were not available in the 16th century.  The parody website goes on to describe the childhood and adult life of Lynwood, including his supposed death from choking on a dumpling.UncyclopediaWhen it came to the origins of the children’s song, Uncyclopedia mockingly claimed that the Muffin Man title came from the manner in which he killed his victims:His nickname The Muffin Man is actually a reference to how he committed the murders. By local folklore, it is said Frederic would tie a muffin to a string, and as a child tried to get it, he pulled the string, eventually luring the child to his house and giving him ample time to knock the child out with a wooden spoon. However, people often question whether these children actually died from being beaten with said wooden spoon or if the Muffin Man would kill them some other way.His nickname The Muffin Man is actually a reference to how he committed the murders.

However, people often question whether these children actually died from being beaten with said wooden spoon or if the Muffin Man would kill them some other way.“The song Do You Know the Muffin Man? was used as a warning to small children of the presence [sic] life of crime, and to help identify his modus operandi so that children can report him to the authorities,” joked the website.A Medium essay written by Sarah Cottrell, meanwhile, reported the legend is either “one hell of a folklore story or one of history’s most creepy mysteries.” In her piece, Cottrell also claimed that Lynwood, who supposedly was born in 1563 and died in 1612, delivered his freshly baked goods to homes on Drury Lane.Medium essayBut according to the book “The Singing Game” by Opie & Opie (page 380), “The Muffin Man” was first recorded in a British manuscript in 1820 and was preserved in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. In its original form as a poem, it read:The Singing GameDo you know the muffin man?The muffin man, the muffin man.Do you know the muffin manWho lives in Drury Lane?Do you know the muffin man?The muffin man, the muffin man.Do you know the muffin manWho lives in Drury Lane?Still, there are small grains of truth to the rumored claims. A passage recorded in the Cambridge World History of Food confirmed that households during the Victorian period — which spanned between 1837 and 1901 and not during Lynwood’s alleged reign of terror — would often have fresh foods delivered door to door by a “muffin man.” The “muffin” of the rhyme is believed to have been an English muffin baked of bread, not the sweeter U.S. version. And the rhyme could very well have been inspired by a real muffin man of Drury Lane, which is a thoroughfare bordering Covent Garden in downtown London.Another English version of the song substitutes “Drury Lane” with “Dorset Lane,” an area of east London. Dorset Lane was once reputed as the “worst street in London,” marking the 1888 murder site of Mary Jane Kelly — the youngest of Jack the Ripper’s victims.A photograph of Dorset Lane taken in 1902. Public DomainA photograph of Dorset Lane taken in 1902. Public DomainPublic DomainBut that’s where the similarities stop. There are no historical accounts of the so-named Lynwood rumored to have been the first serial killer in England. In fact, that title goes to Mary Ann Cotton. At the time of her 1873 hanging for the murder of her fourth husband’s son, the 40-year-old Cotton was known to have committed at least 21 murders, including 11 of her 13 children, three of her four husbands, one lover, and her mother, according to Huffington Post.Huffington PostIt appears that nobody really knows the muffin man, after all.Snopes contacted historical literary experts at the University College London and Oxford University for more information about the origins of the nursery rhyme. We will update the article with any new information.","https://www.tiktok.com/@jackglitched/video/6918195713255951622?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowamDlT8BZ%2BNj9AhjRT1axt7RMEMWFgpkQnCtjmWsC%2FqmZoIUH21ybyUZB227fRaaYGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAtkK65Nm8bZrDe9jjCRwRYYCCOarqmf_a8L27_DUKBel5ZcJrBjf-gwhoVJWg3pe6&share_app_name=musically&share_item_id=6918195713255951622&share_link_id=742c90b7-c4af-460e-b92e-305ebc729968&timestamp=1611247513&u_code=db14g4354662g9&user_id=6794681232397747206&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=android&utm_source=messenger&source=h5_m&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1,https://www.tiktok.com/@jackglitched,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/serialkillertiktok,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/serialkiller,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/muffinman,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/shrek,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/truecrime,https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ssdgm,https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6918195685141531397,https://mirror.uncyc.org/wiki/The_Muffin_Man,https://sarahcottrell.medium.com/do-you-know-the-muffin-man-he-was-a-serial-killer-who-preyed-on-kids-eaf12c90a8d1,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Singing_Game/lUxZshFBRFYC,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/drury-lane.jpg,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dorset-street-1902.jpg,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mary-ann-cotton-englands_b_8339314",Was ‘Muffin Man’ Song a Warning to Kids About 16th-Century Serial Killer?,,,,,,

The tweet, attributed to Twitter user @ThaOriginalKaee, read as follows:So Lyft has a new program that will pick you up and take you to a job interview for free, and if you get hired they will give you up to three weeks of free rides until you get paid.

The tweet was also originally published in October 2019. For reasons that are not clear, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in January and February 2021, as illustrated by the following screenshot, which shows just a selection of Facebook posts from the first two months of the year:suspendedseveralscreenshotsshowingvariousFacebook postsThe post was largely accurate. Lyft does indeed run an initiative called the “Jobs Access Program” that gives some users the opportunity to get free rides to job interviews and training and, if they become employed, free transportation to and from their new job for the first three weeks.However, the service is not available to everyone. Lyft runs the jobs access program in just 20 cities across the United States and Canada, and it is primarily targeted at individuals who have historically experienced difficulties in gaining employment, such as veterans and persons with disabilities.In February 2021, many social media users shared @ThaOriginalKaee’s viral tweet, which described the initiative as “new.” However, most screenshots of that tweet had the date cut off, meaning many readers will have mistakenly understood Lyft’s initiative to be a new one. While that was true at the time the tweet was originally published in October 2019, it wasn’t “new” in 2021.AnalysisLyft launched the jobs access program in October 2019, announcing it had partnered with non-profit groups including United Way, Goodwill, the National Down Syndrome Society, and the USO (United Service Organizations). The news release associated with the launch explained the initiative, as follows:news release… We’re excited to announce Lyft’s Jobs Access Program, a new initiative that aims to close short-term transportation gaps related to employment access and job training. For the unemployed, reliable transportation to a job interview or to the first few weeks of work can mean the difference between successful, long-term employment and lost opportunities. So we’ve partnered with several leading national and local organizations dedicated to workforce development in order to deliver free or discounted rides to people making their way through the employment pipeline. Lyft’s Jobs Access Program will focus on three key interventions in the employment pipeline that are critical to individual success, and where transportation can play a major role: Rides to/from job training programsRides to/from job interviewsRides to/from the first three weeks of employment, until individuals receive their first paycheck and begin to pay for their own transportation.We are focused on communities that stand to benefit most from short-term transportation support, ranging from veterans to individuals with disabilities. … We’re excited to announce Lyft’s Jobs Access Program, a new initiative that aims to close short-term transportation gaps related to employment access and job training.

However, the company’s website now lists only 20 cities and states in which the jobs access program is operational. As of February 2021, they are: Atlanta; Austin; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; New Jersey; New York; Oakland; Philadelphia; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle; Tacoma; Toronto; Ottowa; Washington, D.C.now listsIn December 2020, Lyft stated that in the 14 months since it was launched the jobs access program had facilitated more than 30,000 free rides for individuals. statedWhile it wasn’t immediately clear what exact criteria and restrictions applied to the way in which United Way, Goodwill, and other charities distribute free ride credits to applicants, the program is clearly designed to prioritize individuals with the most acute need of assistance in accessing transportation in order to enter, or re-enter, the workforce. There is also an application process, whereby would-be users submit their name, contact details, and some basic information about themselves and, according to Lyft’s website, can expect to receive a response within a week.websiteSo a program does exist whereby Lyft, in partnership with several non-profit organizations, provides free rides to and from job interviews, training, and for the first three weeks of a beneficiary’s new employment.

By enabling the mute setting, Zoom users are supposed to be able to block all in-person audio or background noise from interrupting the virtual get-together.shokshootermuteThe TikTok user, whose identity remained unknown, posted a video on Feb. 10 that alleged he had the below-displayed Zoom conversation with someone he claimed to be his teacher while his microphone was supposedly turned off.Alleged teacher: Are you still here?@shokshooter: Yeah.Alleged teacher: Did you need something?@shokshooter: You know I’m muted obviously, right?Alleged teacher: I can’t discuss that. @shokshooter: OK, well you do. Can you tell me how that works, because it kind of seems fishy?Alleged teacher: I have another class I need to get to.

Can you tell me how that works, because it kind of seems fishy?@shokshooter:Alleged teacher: I have another class I need to get to. We can discuss this another time.Alleged teacher:The TikTok user framed his videos as evidence of some kind of program or feature that allows authority figures such as teachers to secretly listen in on Zoom users whose computer screens showed a red line through a microphone symbol in the corner, supposedly meaning their microphones are “muted.”The alleged teacher in the Feb. 10 video remained unknown.We reached out to @shokshooter’s TikTok and Instagram accounts — both of which display the moniker “Mic Mute Man” — to discuss the allegations he made in the videos, but we have not received a response. We will update this report when or if we do.To investigate the underlying claim, however, we sought any evidence of a feature or application that allowed certain Zoom users to hear all meeting participants, regardless of their microphone or audio settings.A web page on Zoom’s Help Center, an online hub to help users navigate the program, read:web pageAs the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions. All participants can also mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting.Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent. The host can either use the Ask All to Unmute option, which will prompt every user to unmute themselves, or can schedule the meeting with Request permission to unmute participants enabled, which will prompt the participants for pre-approval to be unmuted by the host.As the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions. All participants can also mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting.Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent. The host can either use the Ask All to Unmute option, which will prompt every user to unmute themselves, or can schedule the meeting with Request permission to unmute participants enabled, which will prompt the participants for pre-approval to be unmuted by the host.Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent.In other words, the video chatting service gives hosts (the users who schedule the virtual meetings and invite others to join) the authority to determine how all other participants can use their microphones.The hosts can turn people’s mics off — muting them — involuntarily, or they can choose options that allow participants to decide the audio setting for themselves throughout the meeting.So while the technology allows teachers, presumably hosts of Zoom classes, to mute students, the web service’s guidelines explicitly state that such users cannot unmute participants without their approval first, due to laws governing communication privacy.unmuteLet us note here: At the start of, or throughout, meetings, hosts can turn people’s mute setting off — allowing their voice or background noise to be heard — only if the participant previously granted consent for that action. See the below-displayed example of that question to Zoom users, which Snopes obtained via its Help Center.In the viral TikTok videos, however, the narrator not only alleged the presumed hosts of his Zoom meetings unmuted him against his will, but also that his view of the video chatting service showed his microphone turned off.We reached out to Zoom to ask if it offered any features or programs to which users could subscribe that enabled them to hear meeting participants whose screens showed them muted. Matt Nagel, a spokesperson for the company, responded to our question via email:The answer is no, and it’s unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary. Zoom takes security and privacy very seriously. We do not offer the ability, or a separate plan, other software, or any other means to secretly unmute and listen to others.The answer is no, and it’s unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary.

Jim Jordan, a fierce Trump supporter, alleged in the below-displayed Facebook post that House Democrats intentionally “left out” footage of the former president telling supporters on Jan. 6 to “peacefully and patriotically” protest the outcome of the 2020 election.Facebook postThe following day, Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, echoed the allegation, tweeting: “There’s one line from President Trump’s January 6th speech that Democrats keep conveniently leaving out: ‘Peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.'”tweetingTo investigate the claim, we first gathered evidence to confirm or disprove that Trump made the comment to supporters on Jan. 6. According to video footage by Bloomberg and a transcript by Factba.se of Trump’s remarks during the so-called “Save America Rally” at Ellipse Park near the White House around noon (EST) that day, the former president indeed said:video footagetranscriptAfter this, we’re going to walk down — and I’ll be there with you — we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down — anyone you want, but I think right here — we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing, and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated — lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today.After this, we’re going to walk down — and I’ll be there with you — we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down — anyone you want, but I think right here — we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.

I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today.He made that statement in the first half of the approximately 70-minute speech, which centered on baseless conspiracy theories advanced to convince Americans that he legally deserved another term in the White House.70-minute speechbaselessLater in the remarks, as some of his supporters started breaching security barriers surrounding the Capitol, the former president also said:We’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue — I love Pennsylvania Avenue — and we’re going to the Capitol. And we’re going to try and give — the Democrats are hopeless, they never vote for anything, not even one vote — but we’re going to try to give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help; we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.We’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue — I love Pennsylvania Avenue — and we’re going to the Capitol.

So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.In other words, it was true that Trump at one point told his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically” leave the pro-Trump event at Ellipse Park — which is directly south of the White House and a roughly 20-minute walk from the Capitol — and go to the Capitol to try to convince members of Congress to delay a constitutional vote affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.2020 election winThose were not his only directions to the crowd, however. In the same speech, he also used the following phrases while encouraging people to head to the Capitol and protest his election loss, according to the transcript and video of the speech:“We will stop the steal.”“We will not let them silence your voices.”“You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”“We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing.”“We’re going to try and give [lawmakers] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”“We’re going to have to fight much harder.”“We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”“We will stop the steal.”“We will not let them silence your voices.”“You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”“We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing.”“We’re going to try and give [lawmakers] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”“We’re going to have to fight much harder.”“We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”It’s a subjective call as to whether those comments were meant to condone violence and crimes — the opposite of telling people to march “peacefully and patriotically” — on the part of right-wing extremists without explicitly encouraging it.Next, to investigate the claim that Democrats omitted any reference to Trump’s “peacefully and patriotically” remark during the alleged video displayed on the first day of the impeachment trial, we sought access to the video compilation that Democratic House impeachment managers (a group of nine lawmakers appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) presented in the Senate chamber as part of their opening presentations on Feb. 9, via CSPAN and The Guardian.Democratic House impeachment managersCSPANThe GuardianBased on our scene-by-scene review of that roughly 13-minute video, Jordan’s allegation in the Facebook post was true: It did not include this authentic quote from the president at Ellipse Park: “peacefully and patriotically make your votes heard today.”The video montage did, however, include a portion of a video Trump posted to social media during the riot, in which he did not condemn the mob nor back down from his weeks-long misinformation campaign about the 2020 election, but rather told them to “go home in peace.”videoLet us note here: As the trial continued into its second day, Democratic impeachment managers did acknowledge Trump’s more peaceable remarks, while attempting to remind viewers of the larger context. On Feb. 10, around 3:30 p.m. (EST) (hours after Meadows’ tweet), Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and impeachment manager, confirmed that Trump told supporters to “peacefully and patriotically” protest on Jan. 6, and played footage of that moment on the Senate floor.“One of President Trump’s key defenses focus on what he said for a few seconds, 15 minutes into the speech,” she said, and then played the clip, according to C-SPAN footage. “In a speech spanning almost 11,000 words — yes, we did check — that was the one time, the only time, president Trump used the word ‘peaceful’ or any suggestion of nonviolence.”C-SPAN footage","https://www.facebook.com/35499336459/posts/10159034024061460,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-11.36.32-AM.png,https://twitter.com/MarkMeadows/status/1359567041150283777,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht20eDYmLXU,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-campaign-rally-the-ellipse-january-6-2021,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-tell-supporters-storm/,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/11/04/live-updates-snopes-coverage-of-the-aftermath-of-the-2020-u-s-election/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-collection/,https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/09/965914210/meet-the-house-managers-laying-out-the-case-to-impeach-donald-trump,https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4944572/house-impeachment-managers-video-compilation-january-6-attack-us-capitol,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2021/feb/09/democrats-play-montage-of-footage-from-capitol-siege-during-trump-impeachment-hearing-video,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trump-say-he-loved-rioters/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-4.01.51-PM.png,https://www.c-span.org/video/?508741-1/impeachment-trial&vod&start=0",Did Dems’ Video Omit Trump’s Telling Supporters To ‘Peacefully and Patriotically’ Protest at Capitol?,,,,,,

Shortly afterward, a rumor started circulating that the 31-year-old, Yuri Andrade, had a second motive: To win $375,000 on a $50,000 prop bet he had placed before the game:There’s little evidence to support this claim. This rumor appears to have originated with an Instagram post from Sideline Daily. The sports-centric social media account shared a picture of Andrade at a restaurant and wrote that the Super Bowl streaker had told him that he had placed a $50,000 prop bet that someone would streak during the game. In the fourth quarter, when the game thus far had been streak-less, Andrade took matters into his own hands:shared a pictureWe have some doubts about this claim, to say the least. For starters, a streaker, by definition, is a person who runs naked through a public space. As seen in the meme above, Andrade was not naked when he ran across the football field. While social media posts and news articles might use “streaker” to describe Andrade, we doubt that a bookie backing a $50,000 bet would let this sort of technicality slide, especially when the gambler is attempting to game the system. definitionnakedFurthermore, it’s unlikely that Andrade would have been able to gamble such a large sum of money on a prop bet (or novelty bet.)

Nowhere close.”Kelly Stewart, another reporter who covers the gambling beat under the handle @KellyInVegas, also noted that there was no chance someone would be allowed to make a $50,000 prop bet. Stewart said that it can be difficult to get a $200 prop bet, let alone one at $50,000:StewartIf Andrade couldn’t place a $50,000 bet himself, what if he got hundreds of people to place smaller bets? Stewart threw cold water on that claim, too:claimLook at the anthem prop. Can bet couple hundo here and there. Gets bet up huge on Friday after the rehearsal. Books take it down. You actually think if there were 500 guys all betting $100 the streaker prop at the same time the book wouldn’t take it down. LOLLook at the anthem prop. Can bet couple hundo here and there.

We can discuss this another time.Alleged teacher:The TikTok user framed his videos as evidence of some kind of program or feature that allows authority figures such as teachers to secretly listen in on Zoom users whose computer screens showed a red line through a microphone symbol in the corner, supposedly meaning their microphones are “muted.”The alleged teacher in the Feb. 10 video remained unknown.We reached out to @shokshooter’s TikTok and Instagram accounts — both of which display the moniker “Mic Mute Man” — to discuss the allegations he made in the videos, but we have not received a response. We will update this report when or if we do.To investigate the underlying claim, however, we sought any evidence of a feature or application that allowed certain Zoom users to hear all meeting participants, regardless of their microphone or audio settings.A web page on Zoom’s Help Center, an online hub to help users navigate the program, read:web pageAs the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions. All participants can also mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting.Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent. The host can either use the Ask All to Unmute option, which will prompt every user to unmute themselves, or can schedule the meeting with Request permission to unmute participants enabled, which will prompt the participants for pre-approval to be unmuted by the host.As the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions.

See the below-displayed example of that question to Zoom users, which Snopes obtained via its Help Center.In the viral TikTok videos, however, the narrator not only alleged the presumed hosts of his Zoom meetings unmuted him against his will, but also that his view of the video chatting service showed his microphone turned off.We reached out to Zoom to ask if it offered any features or programs to which users could subscribe that enabled them to hear meeting participants whose screens showed them muted. Matt Nagel, a spokesperson for the company, responded to our question via email:The answer is no, and it’s unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary. Zoom takes security and privacy very seriously. We do not offer the ability, or a separate plan, other software, or any other means to secretly unmute and listen to others.The answer is no, and it’s unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary.

Recently, however, the school decided that it was no longer going to use real skeletons in its education programs and returned the remains to Filip’s family. The Greek Orthodox family opposed cremation, Prince Midnight wrote, and burying the remains proved expensive. So, he came up with a solution: He would turn the skeleton into a guitar. Prince Midnight wrote in two Instagram posts:InstagrampostsSo, my uncle Filip died in the 90’s and donated his body to science. However, the schools in Greece discontinued using actual skeletons and he ended up in a box in a cemetery that the family has had to pay rent on (permanent grave was $150,000) So, we finally made the move to bring him to the US. Happy to be reunited!As many of you know, my uncle Filip was a big metal head and very influential to me growing up. Since repatriating his remains, I’ve struggled with what to do with them.

He also noted that drilling through bone smelled worse than soldering wires.On Feb 10, he posted a video of the supposedly showed the skelecaster in action:Prince Midnight’s account did not include too many specific details that we could fact check. We don’t know uncle Filip’s full name, for instance, nor the school where his remains were stored for the last two decades. The Tampa Bay Times also cast some doubt on this story.
