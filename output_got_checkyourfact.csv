Footage from Obama’s 2020 appearance at the 2020 DNC shows she is wearing a necklace that spells the word “VOTE,” not “MIKE.”   Fact Check: The image’s caption reads, “Mike needs to man up,” while one commenter stated, “We all know Mike, we always have dude.” The caption and comments seem to reference the a baseless conspiracy theory that Obama is transgender and was born a man named Michael Lavaughn Robinson. “That awkward moment when Michelle’s necklace from the 2020 DNC goes viral,” reads text in the image. (RELATED: Did Michelle Obama Call Country Music ‘Intellectually Devoid’?)  While the photo does, in fact, appear to come from Obama’s remote keynote speech at the DNC in August 2020, her necklace has been digitally altered in the photo. Check Your Fact found a similar photo to the one in the Facebook post published on CNN in August 2020 showing Obama wearing the same dark purple top, but her necklace spells out “VOTE.” Additionally, videos of Obama’s speech shared by USA Today and The Washington Post on YouTube show she was wearing a necklace that spelled the word “VOTE.” The accessory, which can be purchased from the jewelry line ByChari for $295, was the subject of news reports and appears to have underscored a key message of Obama’s DNC speech: the need to vote in the 2020 presidential election. “If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we don’t make a change in this election,” she warned in her speech. The Office of Barack and Michelle Obama did not return a request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Last week, NASA successfully landed its latest rover, Perseverance, on Mars. Many social media users were excited by the news and began sharing images and videos purportedly taken on the red planet’s surface. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Footage Captured By The Perseverance Mars Rover) One widely-shared image claims to be a picture from Mars that shows the distant planets of Earth, Venus and Jupiter as white specks in the red-tinted sky. The caption reads, “Earth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars.”  The image is computer generated, not an actual photo from Mars. Check Your Fact found that the picture was the subject of a 2012 Slate article titled “An unreal Mars skyline,” in which astronomer Phil Plait noted that the letters “NE,” as in the direction northeast, are visible in the bottom-left corner, indicating it was created using planetarium software. NASA also confirmed to the Associated Press that the picture is not real. “This image is not a real image,” Edwin Kite, a University of Chicago assistant professor that studies Mars, told Check Your Fact in an email. “Looks like it’s a revival of a simulated image from no later than 2012.” The image has circulated the internet since at least 2012, reverse image searches show. One of the earliest appearances of the image is in a 2010 blog post in which the author, Louise Riofrio, wrote, “This is the view you would see looking East from Gusev Crater at local sunrise, 1:14 PM Universal Time,” also seemingly indicating it is not a real picture from Mars. Mars rovers have taken photos from the surface of the red planet that show other planetary bodies in the sky. In 2014, NASA’s Curiosity rover captured Earth and the Moon in the night sky. Another image on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s website shows Earth and Venus in 2020.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of Biden signing this executive order. It has been fabricated. Fact Check:   The Federal Register has published 32 executive orders signed by Biden as of press time. In recent days, multiple Facebook users have shared an image that purportedly shows “executive order #58” which the president allegedly signed on Feb. 21. “Political humor is deemed to be ‘hate speech’ if directed at the Biden/Harris administration, and is banned and outlawed effective immediately forthwith,” the supposed executive order reads. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Sign An Executive Order To Tear Down The US-Mexico Border Wall?) The image appears to be a hoax. It lacks components that recent, genuine executive orders signed by Biden have, such as a title and the phrase “by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.”  Furthermore, there is no record of Biden signing an executive order on Feb. 21 or any other date to ban “political humor” directed at his administration. It cannot be found in the Federal Register’s database of Biden’s executive orders or on the White House website. CNN and MarketWatch have published articles tracking Biden’s executive actions. Neither of those articles includes a ban on “political humor” among the executive orders Biden has signed. The notion that the pictured executive order is “executive order #58” further adds to its dubiousness. Miriam Vincent, a staff attorney at the Office of the Federal Register, told Check Your Fact in an email that “executive orders are numbered consecutively across administrations.” Former President Donald Trump’s final executive order was labeled EO 13984, while Biden’s first was EO 13985, Vincent explained. The real EO 58 is not available on the Federal Register’s website. Based on a table of executive orders by president from The American Presidency Project, the real order was likely issued in the 19th century.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Maxine Waters saying “there is no reason for anyone to own a gun” and praising her “armed security detail.”  Verdict: False Waters did not tweet the pictured comment. The tweet actually came from a parody Twitter account that has since been suspended.   Fact Check: Social media users shared screen grabs of the Feb. 15, 2018, tweet this week, seemingly believing the congresswoman actually tweeted it. Waters has expressed support for gun control measures on Twitter and co-sponsored the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019. “There is no reason for anyone to own a gun,” reads the supposed 2018 tweet from Waters. “If a home invader gets past my armed security detail (which they won’t because I hire the best), then what good is a gun going to do me? #GunControlNow.” (RELATED: Did Ted Cruz Tweet, ‘I’ll Believe In Climate Change When Texas Freezes Over’?)  In reality, the tweet didn’t come from Waters. The Twitter account @MaxinePWaters was a parody account prior to being suspended by Twitter for violating the platform’s rules, an archived version of the account shows. The account described itself as a “parody account” in its bio, according to a 2018 snapshot on Archive.is. Waters has two verified Twitter accounts – @RepMaxineWaters and @MaxineWaters. The tweet’s remark does not appear in any of Waters’ social media posts or in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. The inaccurate claim that the tweet came from Waters first surfaced after the deadly February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Snopes debunked the attribution to Waters that month.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/buriedinink/posts/10223603140002550,https://www.facebook.com/buriedinink/posts/10223603140002550,https://twitter.com/RepMaxineWaters/status/1158760268404600832,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1296/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1296/actions,https://www.facebook.com/buriedinink/posts/10223603140002550,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/19/fact-check-ted-cruz-tweet-believe-climate-change-texas-freezes-over/,https://twitter.com/MaxinePWaters,https://archive.is/2iDtQ,https://archive.is/2iDtQ,https://twitter.com/RepMaxineWaters,https://twitter.com/MaxineWaters,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22There%20is%20no%20reason%20for%20anyone%20to%20own%20a%20gun%22%20(from%3ARepMaxineWaters%20OR%20from%3AMaxineWaters)&src=typed_queryhttps://twitter.com/search?q=%22There%20is%20no%20reason%20for%20anyone%20to%20own%20a%20gun%22%20(from%3ARepMaxineWaters%20OR%20from%3AMaxineWaters)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/117483585008/search/?q=%22There%20is%20no%20reason%20for%20anyone%20to%20own%20a%20gun%22,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/MaxineWaters,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/us/parkland-shooting-marjory-stoneman-douglas-2-years/index.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/maxine-waters-guncontrolnow-tweet/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/maxine-waters-guncontrolnow-tweet/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1662647360796456757e73757d6f796364707775623875797b",‘#GunControlNow’ – Did Maxine Waters Send This Tweet About Gun Ownership?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video, filmed in 2019, shows a protest in Madrid against the prime minister’s plans to talk with Catalan separatists.   Fact Check: Madrid and other Spanish cities have seen several protests against COVID-19 restrictions in the last year, according to Reuters. A Feb. 20 Facebook post features a video allegedly showing one of those protests in Madrid. The video shows thousands of people gathered closely in Madrid’s Colón plaza and extending down the street. Loud music is playing and many people appear to be waving Spanish flags. “Protest in Madrid against COVID19 restrictions BRAVO,” the video’s caption reads. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show People In Berlin Protesting Against Coronavirus Restrictions?)  The video, however, predates the COVID-19 pandemic. A reverse image search of key frames from the 28-second video reveals it was first shared in February 2019 and depicts a protest against the Spanish government’s plan to hold talks with Catalan separatists. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first surfaced in late 2019. Catalonia, a northeastern region of Spain, has been fighting for independence from Spain for years and has held several pro-independence demonstrations since an October 2017 independence referendum was banned, BBC News reported. Spanish newspaper El Periódico shared the same 28-second video on Feb. 10, 2019 with a headline that translates to, “Demonstration against Pedro Sánchez this morning in Plaza Colón in Madrid.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez initiated the 2019 plan to talk with the Catalan separatists, a move that angered political conservatives in the country who favor a united Spain, according to BBC News. Spanish politician Pedro J. Cabrera Rentero also shared a similar video on Facebook on Feb. 10, 2019 with a caption that translates to, “Today civil society has gathered in Madrid to demand the unity of Spain from the Government. We are already fed up with the continuous transfers to those who want to break our country in exchange for extending Pedro Sánchez’s stay in Moncloa for a few more months. We want to vote now!” Moncloa is the official workplace and residence of the Spanish prime minister, according to the building’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A Coca-Cola spokesperson refuted the claim.   Fact Check: Coca-Cola has faced criticism from some social media users for a diversity training presentation offered through LinkedIn that included the phrase “try to be less white,” according to Newsweek. Some Twitter users called for a boycott of the soft-drink company. The viral Facebook post alleges that when asked about calls for a boycott, Coca-Cola’s CEO said, “A few right winged nuts won’t affect our bottom line.” (RELATED: Did PepsiCo Give $100 Million To Black Lives Matter?)  There is no evidence Quincey made the comment, however. Check Your Fact searched for media reports using Google and DuckDuckGo and didn’t find any attributing the quote to him. The statement also doesn’t appear in any posts on Coca-Cola’s website, Twitter account or Facebook page. Debbie Ebalobo, a Coca-Cola spokesperson, told Check Your Fact in an email that the quote is “not accurate.” Ebalobo also shared the soft-drink company’s statement regarding LinkedIn training seminar. “The video and images attributed to a Coca-Cola training program are not part of the company’s learning curriculum. Our Better Together global training is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace,” the statement reads. “It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long.

It has been fabricated.   Fact Check: Facebook users have been sharing an image that allegedly shows a tweet Biden sent at 1:16 p.m. on Feb. 21. The tweet purportedly garnered 3,000 retweets and 8,000 likes. “I’m proud to see Coca-Cola educate their staff in cultural reappropriation,” Biden supposedly tweeted. “The disconnect is because the way white people talk leaving minorities confused. Black people communicate a certain way and me and my staff know how those kinds of people talk and it’s time white people learn to do the same #justforthetasteofit #dietcoke.”  While some Facebook users appear to believe Biden sent the tweet, there is no record of him doing so. A search of the president’s Twitter timeline turned up no matches for the tweet. Nor can it be found in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. The tweet seems to have been fabricated, as it exceeds Twitter’s 280-character limit. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden ‘Quietly’ Pardon 2,617 Black Lives Matter Protesters?) The fake tweet circulated online amid Coca-Cola facing criticism from some for a diversity training presentation offered through LinkedIn that included the phrase “try to be less white,” Newsweek reported. Karlyn Borysenko, an organizational psychologist and YouTube commentator, told the outlet that multiple Coca-Cola employees said the course was mandatory, while Coca-Cola said in a statement that it was “not part of the company’s learning curriculum.” “Our Better Together global training is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace,” Coca-Cola’s statement reads in part. “It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long. The training includes access to the LinkedIn Learning platform on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity and inclusion. The video in question was accessible on the LinkedIn Learning platform but was not part of the company’s curriculum.” The course is no longer available on LinkedIn Learning, according to Newsweek.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=905928916888442&id=100024140261314,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=905928916888442&id=100024140261314https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=905928916888442&id=100024140261314,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=905928916888442&id=100024140261314,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22I%27m%20proud%20to%20see%20Coca-Cola%20educate%20their%20staff%20in%20cultural%20reappropriation%22%20(from%3AJoeBiden%20OR%20from%3APOTUS)&src=typed_queryhttps://twitter.com/search?q=%22I%27m%20proud%20to%20see%20Coca-Cola%20educate%20their%20staff%20in%20cultural%20reappropriation%22%20(from%3AJoeBiden%20OR%20from%3APOTUS)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/JoeBiden,https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/15/fact-check-joe-biden-pardon-2617-black-lives-matter-protesters/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210219185910/https://www.linkedin.com/learning/confronting-racism-with-robin-diangelo,https://www.newsweek.com/linkedin-removes-diversity-lesson-less-white-1571205,https://twitter.com/DrKarlynB/status/1362774562769879044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1362774562769879044%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailycaller.com%2F2021%2F02%2F23%2Flinkedin-robin-diangelo-confronting-racism-course-removed-be-less-white-diversity-coca-cola%2F,https://www.newsweek.com/linkedin-removes-diversity-lesson-less-white-1571205,https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/diversity-equity-inclusion-training,https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/diversity-equity-inclusion-training,https://www.linkedin.com/learning/confronting-racism-with-robin-diangelo,https://www.newsweek.com/linkedin-removes-diversity-lesson-less-white-1571205,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f1b1d0a19001d2f0c070a0c0416001a1d090e0c1b410c0002","Did Joe Biden Tweet, ‘I’m Proud To See Coca-Cola Educate Their Staff In Cultural Reappropriation’?",,,,,,

Verdict: False The photo, which was originally published in a 2019 Associated Press article, shows German farmers protesting German agricultural restrictions.   Fact Check: India’s government passed laws in September ending a decades-old array of price regulations and buyer restrictions for the sale of farm goods, according to CNN. Hundreds of thousands of farmers in the country have protested the laws since their passage, with many contending that the new policies will permit large companies to decrease prices, the outlet reported. The image in the Feb. 15 Facebook post appears to show a screen grab of a post sharing an image of dozens of tractors lining a street. The farm vehicles seem to be extending down the “Street of June 17” in Berlin, going toward the Brandenburg Gate.  “Farmer’s tractor rally on the roads of Berlin, far away Germany in support of Indian farmers,” a translation of the screen grabbed post reads. “No stopping gas bullets, no water tank. This is a democracy.” While the photo was, in fact, taken in Berlin, it does not show a demonstration in support of Indian farmers. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the image was originally published in a November 2019 Associated Press article. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Real National Geographic Cover About The Indian Farmers’ Protests?) “Farmers have parked their tractors on the ‘Road of June 17’ in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2019,” the photo’s caption reads. “Some thousands farmers are expected in the German capital for a protest rally against the German and European agriculture policy.” Farmers gathered in Berlin Nov. 26, 2019, to protest German environmental restrictions on agriculture which they alleged would make competition against imported goods impossible, according to The Associated Press. The police estimated more than 5,000 tractors extended over 12 miles were at the demonstration, while organizers of the event reported up to 8,500 tractors took part, AFP reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3939649342747937&set=a.449164751796431&type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/asia/india-farmers-protest-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/asia/india-farmers-protest-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3939649342747937&set=a.449164751796431&type=3&theater,https://www.google.com/maps/place/B2,+10557+Berlin,+Germany/@52.5162371,13.3764864,73m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x47a851c655f20989:0x26bbfb4e84674c63!2sBrandenburg+Gate!8m2!3d52.5162746!4d13.3777041!3m4!1s0x47a851c799bf4be1:0x63928389c4ba580a!8m2!3d52.5160444!4d13.3749508,https://apnews.com/article/c876438f330e4d8ea0a062f45f678c65,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/13/fact-check-national-geographic-cover-indian-farmers-protest/,https://apnews.com/article/c876438f330e4d8ea0a062f45f678c65/gallery/7a6b92c05ae346ce83412c3a47f51e5a,https://apnews.com/article/c876438f330e4d8ea0a062f45f678c65,https://news.yahoo.com/thousands-farmers-mass-tractor-protest-berlin-001002326.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4b0b6a1b2abb684a7aca1a7afbdabb1b6a2a5a7b0eaa7aba9",Does This Photo Show A Berlin Tractor Rally In Support Of Indian Farmers’ Protests?,,,,,,

It cannot be found in his collected written works.   Fact Check: The internet is replete with claims that Nostradamus predicted various world events that occurred after his 1566 death, including that he foretold the death of King Henry II, the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. This particular Facebook post alleges Nostradamus wrote, “A plague shall fall upon the world. After, a feeble man shall rule the Western World with a jezebel. The people will be damaged and subjugated by a fool ruler. The great eagle shall suffer and fall.”   The supposed Nostradamus quatrain includes a photo of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, seemingly suggesting the quote is referencing them. It also mentions a “plague,” which some social media users appear to have connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that the French astrologer had predicted the coronavirus pandemic. There is no evidence Nostradamus ever made such a prediction about Biden and Harris taking office. The quote does not appear in his 1555 book “Les Prophéties,” nor can it be found in his collected works. David Bell, a history professor at Princeton University, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the quote was “almost certainly false.” (RELATED: Did Nostradamus Predict the Coronavirus Outbreak?) “It does not appear in the collected works of Nostradamus,” Bell said. “Moreover, the phrase ‘Western World’ was not in use in the 16th century, when Nostradamus lived and worked.” The fake Nostradamus quote, debunked by Snopes last month, has been circulating online since at least November 2020.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The photo dates back to at least 2018 and appears to have been taken at a house in Upstate New York. Fact Check:   Millions of people in Texas were left without electricity and water after the southern U.S. was struck by a winter storm last week, according to CBS News. Nearly one third of the state’s population was experiencing disrupted water service as of Feb. 22, CNN reported, with many people facing damage to water pipes and their homes. A Feb. 18 image on Facebook purportedly shows a scene from “Houston today” featuring what looks like large icicles hanging from the ceiling in a kitchen. The floor is likewise covered in ice. (RELATED: Did Ted Cruz Tweet, ‘I’ll Believe In Climate Change When Texas Freezes Over’?) Through a reverse image search, however, Check Your Fact discovered that the image does not actually show a scene from the recent winter storm. The image was shared on Reddit in January 2018 with the caption: “This is what happens in my hometown when you don’t leave the faucet trickling in the winter. Pipes bursting in Watertown, NY.”  New York country music radio station Big Frog 104 also published an article about the Reddit post three days after it appeared. The article includes a quote that reads, “As far as I know, a property owned by Bennett Realty had the heat shut off and didn’t also turn the water off and drain the pipes, so they burst in subzero temperatures and that’s why they froze like that.” “This picture was taken like 3 years ago and it was of frozen pipes in a house in upstate ny,” Bennett Realty agent Nikole Roshia told Check Your Fact via email. “It was a house that was under management at Bennett Realty Group.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said on Feb. 19 that it was waiving some fees and testing requirements for plumbers with expired licenses and granting provisional permits to plumbers from out of state to help meet the demand of residents with damaged pipes, NBC 5 Dallas reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=271007261080882&set=gm.3788294811209519,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-power-outage-hospitals-water/,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/us/texas-storm-recovery-monday/index.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-is-making-it-easier-some-plumbers-work-after-storm-2021-2,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/19/fact-check-ted-cruz-tweet-believe-climate-change-texas-freezes-over/,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/7p2hss/this_is_what_happens_in_my_hometown_when_you_dont/?st=JC73U605&sh=b59f529b,https://bigfrog104.com/watertown-frozen-waterfall-inside/,http://www.bennettgrouprealty.com/index.html,https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/texas-permits-out-of-state-expired-license-plumbers-to-help-amid-high-demand/2558240/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fc888e998a938ebc9f94999f978593898e9a9d9f88d29f9391",Does This Photo Show Ice Inside A Houston Home In February 2021?,,,,,,

An Energy Department spokesperson confirmed the post’s claims are inaccurate.   Fact Check: A severe winter storm swept Texas last week, leaving dozens dead and millions temporarily without electricity, The Texas Tribune reported. Since then, a viral claim has spread online that the Department of Energy “blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of killer storm.” “Wanna know what REALLY happened this week?” reads a Feb. 20 Facebook post that has been shared over 800 times. “Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of killer storm.”  The lengthy post goes on to claim that acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga “did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output in Texas” and that, instead, the Biden administration “basically ordered” ERCOT to “throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards.” The post includes screen grabs of the Department of Energy order that allegedly did such things. Kevin Liao, press secretary for the Energy Department, told Check Your Fact in an email that “the exactly opposite is true.” (RELATED: Did CPS Energy Release This Statement About The Power Grid?) “On February 14, ERCOT formally requested the Department of Energy (DOE) issue an emergency order to address electric generation shortages in Texas caused by unprecedented cold weather conditions,” Liao said. “Later that day, DOE approved a Section 202(c) emergency order that allowed specified power plants to generate up to their maximum capacity in order to manage the expected increase in electricity demand.” ERCOT, which oversees Texas’ power grid, did indeed send a request letter on Feb. 14 to the Energy Department. The letter asked the Energy Department to issue an emergency order “authorizing all electric generating units located within the ERCOT interconnection to operate up to their maximum generation output levels under the limited circumstances described in this letter, notwithstanding air quality or other permit limitations.” In the Feb. 14 letter, ERCOT asked the Energy Department to allow specific Texas power plants to exceed federal permit restrictions on nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions. It also mentioned wastewater release limits. The Energy Department granted ERCOT’s request the same day, the emergency order on the agency’s website shows. ERCOT on Feb. 14 also put out a notice to market participants saying the Energy Department had granted its request. “Given the emergency nature of the expected load stress, the responsibility of ERCOT to ensure maximum reliability on its system, and the ability of ERCOT to identify and dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load, I have determined that additional dispatch of the Specific Resources is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest for purposes of FPA section 202(c),” Huizenga wrote in the emergency order. “Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, I am authorizing only the necessary additional generation, with reporting requirements described below.” The emergency order allowed specific ERCOT power plants to operate above the permitted environmental levels “to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes” from Feb. 14 to Feb. 19, according to the order. While there is nothing in the text of the order to indicate that the Energy Department “blocked Texas from increasing power,” it did stipulate that ERCOT must “exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources,” including importing electricity from other states, to “minimize an increase in emissions.” Many of the Facebook post’s claims appear to be lifted from a Feb. 20 InfoWars article titled, “Smoking Gun! Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm.” InfoWars has spread misinformation and unfounded conspiracy theories in the past.

Verdict: False Biden has taken steps such as approving a Feb. 14 emergency declaration and a Feb. 19 major disaster declaration for Texas. Those actions provided federal assistance to the state. He is also expected to visit Texas Feb. 26.   Fact Check: Texas was hit last week by a severe winter storm that has left millions of people without power, according to The Texas Tribune. Amid the winter storm, some Facebook users claimed Biden has done nothing to aid the Lone Star state. “Great job Biden in handling Texas” one such Feb. 19 Facebook post reads. “Do nothing while the people are suffering.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims There Are No Wildfires In Canada Or Mexico)  Biden has taken steps to aid the state, contrary to the post’s claim. On Feb. 14, he approved an emergency declaration for Texas that unlocked federal assistance. The action authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to “identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency,” according to a White House press release. FEMA also announced in a Feb. 14 press release that “federal emergency aid has been made available to the state of Texas to supplement state, tribal and local recovery effort.” FEMA Region 6 tweeted Feb. 18 that it had provided Texas with 729,000 liters of water, over 50,000 cotton blankets and generators and fuel for critical sites.  We are supporting Texas with: ????generators and fuel to support critical sites like hospitals and water facilities ????729,000 liters of water ????More than 50,000 cotton blankets Staging Management Team Atlanta is scheduled to arrive in Texas today to support the state. 2/2 — FEMA Region 6 (@FEMARegion6) February 18, 2021  Biden on Feb. 19 also signed a major disaster declaration for Texas that provided more federal resources to the state, according to NBC News. That declaration made federal funding available to affected individuals in 77 counties in Texas, a White House press release states. “Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,” the press release says in part. Additionally, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed Texas during a Feb. 16 press briefing, stating, “Well, I think our focus right now is ensuring that the millions of people across Texas who were impacted by the storm get the relief they need.” Biden sent a tweet Feb. 18 reiterating his plans to help Texas, saying, “Jill and I are keeping Texas, Oklahoma, and other impacted states in our prayers. I’ve declared states of emergency, authorized FEMA to provide generators and supplies, and am ready to fulfill additional requests.” He additionally advised people in affected areas to “Please heed the instructions of local officials and stay safe.” Biden plans to visit the state Feb. 26, according to CNBC.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Photos and videos show the needle was exposed when Morrison received his COVID-19 vaccine jab.   Fact Check:  Australia started its mass COVID-19 vaccination program on Monday, according to the Associated Press. The country’s prime minister received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday, BBC News reported. Amid the first vaccines being administered in the country, Facebook users attempted to suggest that Morrison’s jab was faked. As evidence, some users attempted to point to an orange part visible in a photo that allegedly covered the needle during the injection.  Pictures taken during Morrison’s vaccination show the needle was not covered with a safety cap when he received his first dose. For example, an AFP photo shows the exposed needle entering his arm. Another picture, published in the Sydney Morning Herald, also shows the needle visible during the injection. ABC News and 7News Australia also posted videos on their respective YouTube channels that capture the moment Morrison received the jab. In both videos, the needle can be seen as the health care worker inserts it into Morrison’s arm. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Acting Secretary Chris Miller Receiving A COVID-19 Vaccine With A Needle-Less Syringe?) The orange piece that’s visible in the photo is likely a needle hub. A needle hub attaches the needle to the syringe and does not cover the needle, according to the Pharmaceutics and Compounding Laboratory at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. Check Your Fact has previously debunked false claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Mike Pence received COVID-19 vaccines with the caps still on the needles.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Biden sending the tweet. The purported tweet has too many characters to be a genuine tweet.   Fact Check: Biden faced some criticism for remarks he made during a Feb. 16 CNN town hall event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, hosted by Anderson Cooper regarding registration for the COVID-19 vaccine and the racial disparities in health care that have been exacerbated by the disease. “Not everybody in the community – in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner city districts – know how to use —  know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreens or at the particular store,” Biden said, according to a transcript on the White House website. “So, we’re also – I’ve committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there. That’s why we’re also trying to set up mass vaccination centers, like places in stadiums and the like.”  Following the comments, social media users shared an image that purportedly shows a tweet sent by Biden on Feb. 18. The alleged tweet attempts to explain that Biden’s remarks during the town hall had been “taken out of context.” “My comment regarding minorities not being able to use the internet was taken out of context,” the purported tweet reads. “It’s not they don’t know how to use it it’s just that they don’t know any better. Those people don’t know about computers because they lack the resources, education and their overall commitment in their communities. It’s not that they’re dumb it’s just they don’t like to do anything. Hope this clears that up.” The tweet, however, is not genuine. Check Your Fact searched both of Biden’s verified Twitter accounts but found no instances of the tweet. Nor could the remark be found in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. The statement doesn’t appear in Biden’s other social media posts or on the White House website either. Had Biden sent the tweet, it almost certainly would have made headlines, yet no media outlets have reported on it. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden ‘Quietly’ Pardon 2,617 Black Lives Matter Protesters?)

Ted Cruz sent a fundraising email blaming “liberal cancel culture” for cutting short his trip to Cancun, Mexico.  Verdict: False There is no record of Cruz sending the email. It appears to be fabricated.   Fact Check: The Texas senator recently faced criticism for traveling to Cancun, Mexico, with his family while millions of Texans were left without electricity or running water after a severe winter storm, according to The New York Times. After his return to the U.S. a day later, Cruz said the trip was a “mistake,” CNN reported. Now, social media users are sharing an image that purportedly shows an email from Cruz asking for donations and saying it was “liberal cancel culture” that shortened his Cancun trip.  However, there is no evidence Cruz sent out this fundraising email. Check Your Fact searched an archive of political and fundraising emails sent out by Cruz but found no mention of his recent Mexico trip. The most recent Cruz email in the database appears to be from Feb. 13, days before he left for Cancun. Jessica Skaggs, Cruz’s press secretary, also confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that the Facebook post’s email is fake. (RELATED: Did Ted Cruz Tweet, ‘I’ll Believe In Climate Change When Texas Freezes Over’?) Some iterations of the image include the disclaimer “this is fake” in small text at the lower-right corner.

Verdict: False The image, which dates back to 2017, actually shows Romanians protesting against a decree about certain corruption offenses. It is unrelated to COVID-19 restrictions.   Fact Check: Protests against government measures aiming to help curb the spread of COVID-19 have taken place in cities across the world. This particular Facebook post, which features a photo of a massive crowd at night, claims to show one such protest that occurred in Romania. “Protests in Romania against ᏨṎvḭᕍ restrictions,” reads the text accompanying the photo. “Why isn’t the media talking about this? Everyone is learning the TRUTH! We are being lied too!” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show People In Berlin Protesting Against Coronavirus Restrictions?)  While the picture is real, it does not show a demonstration against COVID-19 restrictions. A reverse image search revealed the photo has been circulating online since at least 2017, well before the novel coronavirus first emerged. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first surfaced in late 2019, according to a pandemic timeline from The New York Times. EUobserver editor-in-chief Koert Debeuf and political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted the same photo on Feb. 5, 2017, with captions indicating it was taken in Bucharest that night. At the time, Romanians were protesting a decree that aimed to decriminalize some corruption offenses, according to TIME Magazine. The photo being shared online appears to show a crowd gathered near Victory Square in the Romanian capital city of Bucharest. Similar pictures and videos showing a massive crowd gathered in the square on the night of Feb. 5, 2017, can be found in news reports about protests against the decree, which was later withdrawn. While the photo doesn’t show a Romanian protest against coronavirus restrictions, there have been demonstrations against the country’s COVID-19 mitigation measures. For instance, some Romanians protested in September against social distancing and the use of face masks in schools, according to the Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image actually shows a homeless encampment in San Jose, California, which is outside Pelosi’s district.   Fact Check: Pelosi represents California’s 12th congressional district, which covers most of San Francisco, according to her website. Some social media users have been sharing an image, purportedly taken in Pelosi’s district, featuring a woman carrying a jug with several tents in the background. “Third world country?” text in the image states. “Nope… This is San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi’s district.” The conservative student organization Turning Point USA’s logo can be seen in the upper-left portion of the image. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Tweet, ‘I Will Be Introducing Legislation To Welcome United Nations Peace Keepers Into The United States’?)  In reality, the photo was not taken in Pelosi’s congressional district. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the image published by Reuters in 2014. The photo actually shows a homeless encampment occupant as she “collects her belongings as authorities break down massive homeless encampment known as ‘The Jungle’ in San Jose, California December 4, 2014,” according to the photo’s caption. The image also appeared in a December 2014 Business Insider article about the camp, which was located on 68 acres and bordered on San Jose’s Coyote Creek, being dismantled by the City of San Jose. NBC Bay Area and The Mercury News reported that the camp was located near Story Road, where it fell within California’s 19th congressional district. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren has represented California’s 19th congressional district since January 2013, according to GovTrack.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/filipino.scene/posts/3340538449386249,https://www.congress.gov/member/district/nancy-pelosi/P000197?q=%7B%22senate-committee%22%3A%22Environment+and+Public+Works%22%7D,https://pelosi.house.gov/biography-0,https://www.facebook.com/filipino.scene/posts/3340538449386249,https://www.facebook.com/michelle.mahoney.98/posts/3697933003589275,https://www.facebook.com/jim.mcgowan.562/posts/10206948053897558,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/08/13/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-tweet-legislation-united-nations-peacekeepers/,https://pictures.reuters.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&ALID=2C0408WMYRTK0#/SearchResult&ALID=2C0408WMYRTK0&VBID=2C0BX4N8SKWZJ&POPUPPN=1&POPUPIID=2C0408WMC20PA,https://pictures.reuters.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&ALID=2C0408WMYRTK0#/SearchResult&ALID=2C0408WMYRTK0&VBID=2C0BX4N8SKWZJ&POPUPPN=1&POPUPIID=2C0408WMC20PA,https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valleys-biggest-homeless-camp-is-being-broken-up-2014-12,https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/game-of-whack-a-mole-homeless-upset-to-be-evicted-by-police-from-the-jungle-in-san-jose/1983791/#:~:text=But%20the%20city%20is%20committed,housing%20in%20a%20pilot%20project.,https://archive.is/mJUvy,https://www.congress.gov/member/district/zoe-lofgren/L000397,https://www.congress.gov/member/district/zoe-lofgren/L000397,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA/19,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8df9ffe8fbe2ffcdeee5e8eee6f4e2f8ffebeceef9a3eee2e0",Does This Image Show Part Of Nancy Pelosi’s Congressional District?,,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no record of CPS Energy putting out the statement. The company has refuted the attribution.   Fact Check: Texas was hit with a severe winter storm last week that left millions without power and water. 18,000 customers in state still lacked power on Monday, USA Today reported. (RELATED: Is FEMA Paying For Hotel Rooms In Texas?) Amid the deadly winter storm, Facebook users shared a statement about the power grid that they attributed to CPS Energy. The company serves customers in and around San Antonio, according to its website.  “The State has issued critical electric load warning. Grid is about to fail. Prepare!” reads the alleged statement. “Water will go out as well so fill tubs etc as needed. At this time CPS Energy is no longer able to protect even critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, from some level of brownouts.” The message, purportedly from CPS Energy, goes on to tell people to “reduce your thermostats to a maximum of 62 degrees” and say that the company has “no certainty or ability to predict duration or frequency of outages during this critical stage,” among other things. While the company has made numerous statements about the power grid during the mid-February winter storm, this isn’t one of them. Check Your Fact didn’t find the message in press releases on CPS Energy’s website or in posts on its social media pages. Instead, the company shared statements on its Facebook and Twitter accounts that said the message “DID NOT come from CPS Energy.” John Moreno, a spokesperson for CPS Energy, also confirmed to Check Your Fact via email: “This was not an official CPS Energy statement.” (RELATED: Is FEMA Paying For Hotel Rooms In Texas?) CPS Energy did issue a statement on Feb. 15 saying that there was “not enough electric generation available across the state to keep up with customer demand throughout the system.” The statement further asked customers to reduce electricity consumption by taking measures such as turning thermostats down to 68 degrees or lower, unplugging nonessential lights and appliances, and avoiding the use of large appliances. The company tweeted on Feb. 18 that area hospitals were not experiencing blackouts. It also said in the afternoon of Feb. 20 that “there are now 131 customers experiencing an outage.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/claranicoleco/posts/2838718359684500,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/knocked-out-texas-millions-face-record-lows-without-power-new-n1257964,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/22/texas-water-shortages-disruptions-power-outages-misery-continues/4538062001/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/19/fact-check-fema-paying-hotel-rooms-texas/,https://www.facebook.com/claranicoleco/posts/2838718359684500,https://cpsenergy.com/en/about-us/who-we-are.html,https://www.facebook.com/claranicoleco/posts/2838718359684500,https://newsroom.cpsenergy.com/?s=Grid+is+about+to+fail,https://www.facebook.com/page/119877137370/search/?q=%22grid%20is%20about%20to%20fail%22,https://twitter.com/cpsenergy,https://www.facebook.com/CPSEnergy/posts/10158187081707371,https://twitter.com/cpsenergy/status/1361829694254030848,https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-moreno-761a7452/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/19/fact-check-fema-paying-hotel-rooms-texas/,https://newsroom.cpsenergy.com/update-as-of-monday-february-15-2021-255-am-power-emergency-conservation-critical-rotating-outages-have-begun-ercot-grid-operator-issues-power-emergency-across-the-state-of-texas/,https://newsroom.cpsenergy.com/update-as-of-monday-february-15-2021-255-am-power-emergency-conservation-critical-rotating-outages-have-begun-ercot-grid-operator-issues-power-emergency-across-the-state-of-texas/,https://twitter.com/cpsenergy/status/1362430562829553668,https://twitter.com/cpsenergy/status/1363217473437388800,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#04707661726b7644676c61676f7d6b7176626567702a676b69",Did CPS Energy Release This Statement About The Power Grid?,,,,,,

A spokesperson for Pelosi confirmed the quote is “fabricated.”   Fact Check: The Feb. 17 Facebook post includes a caricature of Pelosi, along with an alleged remark she made in 2019 regarding “illegal aliens” losing their rights if people don’t vote for Democrats. There is, however, no record of Pelosi making the purported statement. Check Your Fact found no instances of the remark in the congressional record. A search of Pelosi’s verified social media accounts likewise turned up no results. Nor does the remark appear on either of her congressional websites.  Pelosi’s communications director Henry Connelly told Check Your Fact in an email that, “This is fabricated.” (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi Own Stock In Dominion Voting Systems?) The purported statement’s use of “illegal aliens” would seemingly contradict Pelosi’s previous comments on the phrase, further adding to the quote’s dubiousness. During a 2018 press conference, Pelosi said, “Using terminology like ‘illegal aliens illegally entering the country’ is just not viewed as constructive,” according to The Washington Free Beacon. Congressional Democrats and the White House unveiled on Feb. 18 a large-scale immigration bill, titled the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, according to USA Today. The legislation includes provisions that would create an 8-year pathway to citizenship for almost 11 million undocumented immigrants and would “replace the word ‘alien’ with ‘non-citizen’ in law,” the outlet reported. “I salute the president for putting forth the legislation that he did. There are others that support piecemeal, and that may be a good approach too,” Pelosi said about the bill at a recent press briefing, according to CNBC.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jim.bagnell.5/posts/4424393044253730,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22congrecord%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%2C%20otherwise%20the%20illegal%20aliens%20will%20lose%20their%20rights%5C%22%22%7D&searchResultViewType=expanded,https://www.facebook.com/page/86574174383/search/?q=%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22,https://www.facebook.com/page/1711465445765878/search/?q=%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22%20(from%3ASpeakerPelosi%20OR%20from%3ATeamPelosi)&src=typed_query,https://pelosi.house.gov/search/node/You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22%20%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22,https://www.speaker.gov/search/node/You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%20%22You%20need%20to%20vote%20for%20the%20Democrats%22,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/24/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-own-stock-dominion-voting-systems/,https://freebeacon.com/politics/pelosi-using-terminology-like-illegal-aliens-isnt-constructive/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/18/lawmakers-introduce-president-joe-biden-immigration-legislation/6726804002/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/18/lawmakers-introduce-president-joe-biden-immigration-legislation/6726804002/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/immigration-democrats-to-introduce-bill-with-pathway-to-citizenship.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f5818790839a87b5969d90969e8c9a808793949681db969a98","Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘You Need To Vote For The Democrats, Otherwise The Illegal Aliens Will Lose Their Rights’?",,,,,,

Mitt Romney.  Verdict: False While online petitions have called for Romney to resign or be censured, Check Your Fact didn’t find a recall petition with over 120,000 signatures. U.S. senators can be removed through impeachment or expulsion, not a recall.   Fact Check: The claim that Romney faces a recall petition in Utah started circulating widely after the senator voted on Feb. 13 to convict former President Donald Trump in the second impeachment trial. Trump was impeached and later acquitted on one count of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to The Washington Post. “Utah OFFICIALLY starts RECALL for Mitt Romney,” reads the viral post. “124k signatures in 1 hour!!” (RELATED: Did Mitt Romney Endorse Joe Biden For President?)  While there are several online petitions calling for Romney to resign or be censured, Check Your Fact didn’t find a petition to recall the senator that had 124,000 signatures. There is currently no mechanism in Utah law or the U.S. Constitution that allows for the recall of a sitting U.S. senator. Senators can be removed from office through impeachment or expulsion, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. The U.S. Constitution requires a “concurrence of two-thirds” of the Senate to expel a sitting U.S. senator. Since 1789, the Senate has only expelled 15 senators, 14 of which were expelled “during the Civil War for supporting the Confederacy,” according to the Senate website. In January 2020, then-Utah state Rep. Tim Quinn introduced a bill that would create a mechanism for voters to recall a U.S. senator, according to Deseret News. However, Utah lawmakers decided not to consider the proposal, the Associated Press reported. The Utah GOP has so far not censured Romney for his vote to convict Trump in the second impeachment trial. In a mid-February statement, the Utah GOP said “we look neither to the past, nor to be punitive.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Trump Jr. does not name Abbott in the tweet or accompanying video. Fact Check:  Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz recently faced criticism for traveling to Cancun, Mexico, with his family as a severe winter storm left millions of Texans without power. Cruz, who returned to the U.S. the following day, said the trip was “obviously a mistake” and that he “wouldn’t have done it” in hindsight, according to CNN. Amid the criticism about the trip, Trump Jr. took to Twitter to comment on the situation, saying, “The hypocrisy of those trying to cancel Ted Cruz who have been totally silent on their Democratic Governor’s incompetence is telling. My thoughts on the Cancun Cruz fauxoutrage! #Cruz #CancunGate is fake.”  The hypocrisy of those trying to cancel Ted Cruz who have been totally silent on their Democrat Governor’s incompetence is telling. My thoughts on the Cancún Cruz fauxoutrage! #Cruz #CancunGate is fake. https://t.co/WnYe1onpIK — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 18, 2021  Many social media users, including journalists and political commentators, suggested that Trump Jr. was erroneously referring to Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, as a Democrat. That does not, however, appear to be the case. The misinterpretation of Trump Jr.’s tweet was reported by Newsweek Feb. 19. In his tweet, which includes a link to a Rumble video, Trump Jr. does not explicitly name Abbott. Nor does he mention the Texas governor by name in the linked video. Instead, he appears to be referring to Democratic governors in the plural. The description of the Rumble video, which is visible in his tweet, reads, “The left is trying to cancel Cancun Cruz but it’s not his job. Maybe they should focus on their governors!!!” “Give me a break,” Trump Jr. says in the video. “That they’re spending more time focusing on this than they are, you know, governors just flagrantly disregarding their executive orders, shutting down states, etc. shows you how ridiculous things are.” While not explicitly stated, Trump Jr. seemed to be referring to governors such as Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom apologized in November for attending a dinner party with people outside his household, a move that occurred as statewide public health guidelines discouraged such activities, according to The Washington Post. Trump Jr. also sent a tweet defending Cruz and criticizing Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, several hours earlier. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Jr Commit Treason?) Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake poured water on the claim that Trump Jr. called Abbott a Democrat in a Feb. 19 tweet.

Ted Cruz that reads, “I’ll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over.”  Verdict: False There is no record of Cruz sending or deleting the tweet. It appears to have been fabricated.   Fact Check: Some social media users have been sharing a screen grab of what appears to be a Sept. 8, 2016 tweet from Cruz regarding his views on climate change: “I’ll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over.” This week, a winter storm left millions in Texas without water and electricity. Cruz has expressed skepticism about anthropogenic climate change in the past. In a 2019 interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, Cruz said that data on whether carbon emissions warm the earth is “mixed.” He also argued during a 2015 interview with NPR that the “scientific evidence doesn’t support global warming,” a statement the host pushed back on.  The tweet, however, appears to have been fabricated. Check Your Fact searched both of Cruz’s verified Twitter accounts – @tedcruz and @SenTedCruz – but found no matches. It also does not appear in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets dating back to 2012 or in archived screen grabs of his Twitter account from 2016. Some iterations of the post shared on social media include a “satire” label, further adding to the tweet’s dubiousness. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A Helicopter Spraying De-Icer Made From Fossil Fuels On A Texas Wind Turbine In 2021?) Cruz has faced criticism for flying to Cancun, Mexico, with his family on Wednesday as Texans continued to deal with the effects of the winter storm, according to CNN.

The claim was originally posted on a website that has previously published misinformation.   Fact Check: Bob Iger, in February 2020, abruptly stepped down from his position as CEO of Disney, which he had held since 2005, according to Axios. Now, some social media users are claiming that Iger’s replacement, Bob Chapek, has been arrested. “This is the CEO of Disney Bob Chapek,” reads text superimposed over an image of Chapek. “He is in jail for abusing 2 little girls, yet Disney and the MSM have said nothing.”  There is, however, no evidence Chapek has been jailed for such a thing. Had the CEO of Disney, one of the world’s largest media companies, actually been arrested, it almost certainly would have made headlines, yet no major U.S. or foreign news outlets have reported on it. Disney has also not put out any press releases addressing such a thing. The claim appears to stem from a Feb. 12 article, titled “CEO of Disney jailed on CHILD SEX ABUSE charges,” by the Conservative Beaver, a self-described Canadian conservative news website that publishes “news from your favourite alternative sources.” The article claims that Chapek has been “charged with ten counts of sexual abuse against two children” for incidents that occurred in Burbank, California, and that the charges include “bestiality and making extremely sadistic child pornography.” “The arrest is subject to a gag order,” reads the article’s last paragraph. “This means no media in the US can report on this. Conservative Beaver is based in Montreal, and can report on this freely.” Despite the article’s claims, there is no indication of any “gag order” in place. No international news outlets covered Chapek’s alleged crimes. (RELATED: Was Pope Francis Arrested On Charges Including Human Trafficking And Fraud?) “The claims that ‘Disney CEO Bob Chapek’ has been arrested by the Burbank Police Department (CA) are false,” said Burbank Police Department Sgt. Emil Brimway in an email to Check Your Fact. Brimway also noted that retired Lt. Matthew Ferguson, who is quoted in the Conservative Beaver article, has “not been employed by the City of Burbank or the Burbank Police Department for several years.” This is not the first time The Conservative Beaver has published misinformation. In December, Check Your Fact debunked a false claim shared by the outlet that former President Barack Obama was arrested for espionage. Disney did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Lakewood Church and the City of Houston said the megachurch is open as a warming center for anyone in need.   Fact Check: As winter storms swept Texas and other states this week, Facebook users shared a post alleging Osteen, a popular televangelist that preaches at Lakewood Church, is “not opening his 18,000 seat arena to the freezing homeless.” Osteen faced criticism in 2017 for not immediately opening the Houston megachurch to people displaced by Hurricane Harvey, according to the Houston Chronicle. But, contrary to the Facebook post’s claim, Lakewood Church has been providing assistance to Texans impacted by the winter storm since Sunday. The megachurch tweeted on Feb. 14 that it is a “designated Warming Center beginning today for anyone in need of shelter.”   Lakewood is a designated Warming Center beginning today for anyone in need of shelter. Arrive at either of our main entrances (Lower Edloe or Timmons St.) — Lakewood Church (@lakewoodchurch) February 14, 2021  The City of Houston listed Lakewood Church as a warming center for those in need of shelter in a Feb. 16 tweet. Local news outlets such as the Houston Chronicle and NBC affiliate KPRC 2 also reported on the megachurch opening its doors as a warming center. Lakewood Church has provided beds, blankets and other supplies, with its officials saying no one will be turned away, according to KPRC 2. As many as 300 people, some of them homeless, had been in and out of Lakewood Church as of Feb. 16, Houston Chronicle reported. Osteen tweeted on Feb. 17 that the church’s volunteers and staff had “served over 600 people since Sunday.”  We are blessed to be a blessing!

Verdict: False FEMA is not paying for hotel rooms for people affected by the winter storm in Texas. The organization said the post was a “scam.”   Fact Check: A winter storm sweeping across the southern U.S. has left millions of Texans without electricity amid frigid conditions, killing at least 24, according to CBS News. Biden declared an emergency in Texas on Feb. 14 and directed FEMA to help coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state. Now a viral Facebook post is claiming that as part of relief efforts, FEMA is paying for hotel rooms for those affected by the storm. The post includes a phone number people can allegedly call to set up their free hotel room.  The post, however, appears to be a hoax. “That posting saying that FEMA is here to help with housing assistance is false,” said a FEMA spokesperson, in an email to Check Your Fact. “It is NOT FEMA.” A tweet from FEMA’s verified Region 6 Twitter account also refuted the post’s claim. Region 6 includes Texas, according to FEMA’s website.  There is a false phone number being shared with a message about FEMA paying for hotels for Texas Disaster Relief. ⚠️This is a scam.⚠️ The best information on legitimate sources of help in your area will come from local officials & @TDEM. 1/2 — FEMA Region 6 (@FEMARegion6) February 18, 2021  “There is a false phone number being shared with a message about FEMA paying for hotels for Texas Disaster Relief,” reads the tweet. “This is a scam.” (RELATED: Is FEMA Offering Americans $1,000 In Coronavirus Relief?) FEMA region 6 further tweeted that it was providing “generators and fuel to support critical sites like hospitals and water facilities,” as well as “729,000 liters of water” and “more than 50,000 cotton blankets.” Further, there is no indication that the phone number shared in the Facebook post is being used by FEMA to coordinate hotel stays. The phone number actually connects callers to FEMA’s “internet technical help desk,” which is there to assist with “any online system or problem,” according to an automated message heard when the number is called.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image, which appears to have been taken in 2005, shows frozen boats in Switzerland.   Fact Check:  Winter storms have swept across the U.S. this week, including one in Texas that left millions without power, according to NPR. At least 34 people, including 20 in Texas, have died due to the severe winter weather, CBS News reported Friday. Amid the winter storm hitting Texas, Facebook users have been sharing a photo of boats covered in ice, claiming it was taken in Galveston this month. The caption from one such Feb. 16 post reads, “Galveston Texas today. This is a historic pic. Wow.”  Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the picture had been posted on the website PBase.com by photographer Jean-Pierre Scherrer in a gallery titled “Ice Storm over Geneva, Switzerland.” It was taken on Jan. 29, 2005, in Geneva, not this week in Texas, according to the description. Scherrer also noted on PBase.com that several people had asked if his photos of various frozen objects had been taken in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. (RELATED: Did Police Recently Make A Human Trafficking Bust In Midland, Texas?) “After several people asking if these photos were shot at a place named ‘Lake Geneva’ in Wisconsin, USA, I certify that it is NOT !” he wrote. “I was born in Geneva, Switzerland, and still live there ! I guess the ‘original’ city of Geneva, Switzerland, allready (sic) existed centuries before Americas were even discovered…” Local news station CW39 reported that snow covered Galveston’s beaches on Monday. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department temporarily closed saltwater fishing spots along parts of the state’s coast to “protect resources during freezing weather conditions,” according to a press release.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There is no evidence Schultz or the current CEO of Starbucks made the comment in the Facebook post.   Fact Check: The popular coffee chain has taken various actions in support of the LGBTQ community and marriage equality over the years, including expressing support in a 2012 memo for Washington state legislation to legalize same-sex marriage and in a laudatory statement about the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage. Featured in the Facebook image is what appears to be a screen grab of an article that puts up the headline “Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage DON’T Buy Our Coffee.'” The Feb. 3 post also includes a picture of Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks.  There is no evidence Schultz or Kevin Johnson, the current CEO of Starbucks, made that statement. Check Your Fact didn’t find any reporting from major media outlets corroborating the quote. It also does not appear on the Starbucks website or on either man’s Twitter timeline. “I can confirm this is false,” Starbucks spokesperson Jory Mendes told Check Your Fact via email. (RELATED: Did Starbucks Call To Defund The Police?) Mendes directed Check Your Fact to a video of Schultz defending the company’s support of same-sex marriage at an annual shareholders meeting in 2013. Mendes also noted that the misattribution, which has been circulating online for years, has previously been debunked by other fact-checkers. At the 2013 annual meeting, a shareholder suggested that the company had suffered financially from its decision to support same-sex marriage, according to Forbes and Business Insider. In response, Schultz said that “not every decision is an economic decision.” “If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country,” Schultz went on to say, according to the video. “You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company.” The quote in the Facebook post appears to be a misrepresentation of Schultz’s comment during that 2013 shareholders meeting. Multiple websites over the years have run headlines attributing a statement similar to that in the Facebook post to the Starbucks CEO. Schultz did defend the company’s position on marriage equality, but there is no indication Schultz told customers who support “traditional marriage” to not purchase Starbucks coffee.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Sheila Jackson Lee said, “Hey all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.”  Verdict: False There is no record of Jackson Lee making this statement. A similar version of the quote first appeared in a 2012 article criticizing the U.N.   Fact Check: Social media is often replete with quotes misattributed to politicians. This particular post, which includes an image of Jackson Lee, Texas’ 18th Congressional District representative, as well as an image of the communist logo, purports she said it was time for “wrinkly, white-aged has-beens” to die. There is, however, no record of Jackson Lee making such a comment. Check Your Fact searched the congresswoman’s social media posts, but found no instances of the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. The comment likewise could not be found in the congressional record or anywhere on her House website.  An internet search further found no media reports attributing the statement, which has been circulating online since 2015, to Jackson Lee. Michael McQuerry, a spokesperson for Jackson Lee, told PolitiFact in 2015 that she had never made the remark.(RELATED: Did Sheila Jackson Lee Say, ‘Homicide Is The Leading Cause Of Murder’?) The statement appears to stem from a post published in 2012 by radio podcast Stand Up for the Truth criticising the U.N. The article, titled, “TIME TO DIE: U.N. ADS PROMOTE KILLING OFF THE ELDERLY,” began by asking “wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens” if they were “ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.” Jackson Lee’s name does not appear in the article, and it is unclear how the comment became erroneously attributed to her.

Verdict: False The quote originated in a satirical article. There is no record of him saying the statement featured in the post.   Fact Check: The image credits Johnson with making a lengthy disparaging comment about Scotland and its residents during a June 2019 speech to the 1922 Committee, a group comprised of conservative members of Parliament’s House of Commons. Johnson became the U.K.’s prime minister in July 2019. “We’ve been siphoning off all of their oil underneath their drink-sodden Scottish noses for 30 years without them noticing,” Johnson allegedly said. “And even when they did find out they still voted to stay in our ‘1707 paper political’ Union… …We could turn Loch Lomond into a sewage facility and clear the Highlands again and they’d still want to keep hold of our coat-tails.”  The “1707 paper political” union mentioned in the post appears to be a reference to the 1707 Act of Union, which unified England and Scotland under the name of Great Britain, according to Britannica.com. The clearance of the Scottish Highlands refers to the forced eviction of tenant farmers to make way for sheep farming that took place from the late 1700s to the late 1800s. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Boris Johnson With Ghislaine Maxwell?) While Johnson has faced criticism for comments about Scotland in the past, there is no evidence of Johnson saying the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of transcripts of Johnson’s public remarks, as well as his social media accounts, didn’t return any matches for the statement. Major U.K. media outlets have also not reported about Johnson making the remark during a 2019 speech. A keyword search revealed the quote actually originated in a satirical article published in June 2019 by The National, a newspaper that describes itself as supporting “an independent Scotland.” At the top of the article, which is titled “We need to tax the grievance monkey unwashed Jocks until they squeak,” there is a disclaimer that reads, “For the avoidance of doubt, this piece is a parody.” The U.K. Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Adam Schiff visited deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s private island 78 times.  Verdict: False There is no record in publicly available flight logs of Schiff visiting Epstein’s island over 70 times. The origin of the claim appears to be a satire website.   Fact Check: Epstein, who was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges and later found dead from an apparent suicide in jail, was accused of luring underaged girls to his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, to perform sex acts, according to the indictment. He also allegedly abused underaged girls on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James, the Associated Press reported. The Facebook post attempts to link Schiff to Epstein by claiming “leaked visitor logs” show the congressman visited Little St. James over 70 times. It includes an alleged photo of the two together. (RELATED: Image Claims The FBI Uncovered Over 250 Emails Between Adam Schiff And Jeffrey Epstein)  However, Check Your Fact didn’t find any sources to substantiate the post’s claim. A review of publicly available flight logs from Epstein’s private jet uploaded by Gawker and FactCheck.org turned up no mentions of Schiff. His name also doesn’t yield any results in another searchable database of the flight logs. Media outlets have widely reported about prominent figures who were identified in Epstein’s flight records. If “leaked visitor logs” showed that Schiff had traveled to Little St. James 78 times, news outlets almost certainly would have reported on it. The claim appears to originate from an article published by America’s Last Line of Defense, a parody news website that disclaims in the “About Us” section that “everything on this website is fiction.” The satirical article, which is filed under the “Democrats Satirically Offending” category, bears the same headline as the Facebook post. In December 2019, Check Your Fact debunked the image that purportedly shows Schiff posing for a photo with Epstein. Epstein’s head was superimposed over Schiff’s father’s head to create the false impression that Epstein and the congressman took a picture together.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The remark appears to be a misinterpretation of a 2018 Vanity Fair headline.   Fact Check: The Facebook post claims Harris, the first woman of color to be elected vice president, once said, “If he’s white, he’s going to be racist.” It is unclear who Harris is referring to in the alleged quote. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Say, ‘Our Military Are Soulless Cowards’?) But there is no record of Harris making the statement. Check Your Fact reviewed press releases published on the White House website and found no similar comments to the one attributed to her in the Facebook post. Searching media reports and her verified social media accounts also turned up no instances of the remark. Nor could the statement be found in an archive of her deleted tweets.  The quote, which has been circulating online since at least 2019, may stem from a misinterpretation of a similar quote in a 2018 Vanity Fair headline which reads, “‘He’s still going to be racist if it’s a white nominee’: Can Kamala Harris, non-identity politician, find her way in an identity-politics moment?” The article quotes Jeremy Bird, the national field director for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, as saying the statement featured in the article’s headline in reference to former President Donald Trump. It is possible the quote misattributed to Harris in the Facebook post originated as an altered version of that statement from Bird. This is not the first time a quote misattributed to Harris has spread on social media. Check Your Fact in January debunked a viral post that claimed she once said that Trump supporters will “beg” her for a “loaf of bread.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo, which was taken several years ago, shows a helicopter spraying hot water on a wind turbine in Sweden.   Fact Check: In the viral image, a helicopter can be seen hovering in the air near a wind turbine caked with ice. A device hanging from the helicopter appears to be spraying liquid on the turbine’s blades. (RELATED: Does This Footage Show Military Helicopters Flying Over DC In January?) “In Texas today,” reads the Feb. 15 Facebook post. “A helicopter, using fossil fuels, spraying de-icer, made with fossil fuels, to de-ice a wind turbine, manufactured using fossil fuels, that is supposed to produce clean energy without using fossil fuels. #TheIrony #oilandgas.”  However, a reverse image search revealed the photo predates the winter weather currently impacting Texas by several years and wasn’t taken in the U.S. Check Your Fact found the photo published in a 2015 article published by the Swedish magazine NyTeknik. It also appears in a 2015  presentation deck from the Sweden-based company Alpine Helicopter that is titled “Airborne de-icing solution for wind turbines.” The caption in the 2015 NyTeknik article states the photo, which is credited to Alpine Helicopter, was taken at a Swedish wind farm the previous winter. Alpine Helicopter developed and tested the process of spraying water that was heated with an oil burner from a helicopter to de-ice wind turbines, according to a rough translation of the article. The inaccurate claim about the photo showing a helicopter spraying a Texas wind turbine with de-icing chemicals made from fossil fuels has circulated amid winter weather sweeping across much of the U.S., including Texas. The winter storm has impacted Texas’ power grid, with millions of people across the state still not having power on Wednesday morning, the Wall Street Journal reported. Limited natural gas supply and frozen wind turbines have affected the ability of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which oversees the state’s grid, to create sufficient power, CNN reported. Dan Woofin, a senior director for the ERCOT, said during a press conference Tuesday that a “lot of the generation that’s gone offline today, that either tripped or had to come offline, has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system,” according to local affiliate CBS 11.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/tracy.wimer/posts/10159380218241332,https://www.facebook.com/tracy.wimer/posts/10159380218241332,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/22/fact-check-footage-military-helicopters-dc-january/,https://www.facebook.com/tracy.wimer/posts/10159380218241332,https://www.nyteknik.se/energi/helikopter-stralen-ar-nya-vapnet-mot-isen-6395827,https://windren.se/WW2015/WW2015_13_312_Gedda_Deicing_helicopter.pdf,https://www.nyteknik.se/energi/helikopter-stralen-ar-nya-vapnet-mot-isen-6395827,https://www.nyteknik.se/energi/helikopter-stralen-ar-nya-vapnet-mot-isen-6395827,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/17/us/winter-storm-weather-live,https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-weather-power-outage-11613425923,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/15/us/power-outages-texas-monday/index.html,https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2021/02/16/ercot-president-investigation-mass-power-outages-texas/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#32464057445d4072515a5751594b5d4740545351461c515d5f",Does This Photo Show A Helicopter Spraying De-Icer Made From Fossil Fuels On A Texas Wind Turbine In 2021?,,,,,,

Verdict: False California election law requires signature verification for both mail-in ballots and recall petitions. The state did not forgo the requirement for the November election.   Fact Check: Newsom is facing a recall effort to remove him from office, with some supporters of the move citing Newsom’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine distribution as reasons he should be ousted, KSBY News reported. Newsom’s opponents said they have enough signatures to force a recall election, according to NBC San Diego. A post on Facebook claims, “California wants signature verification for Gavin Newsom’s recall but they didn’t require it for mail-in ballots.” (RELATED: No, Pennsylvania Did Not Reject 372,000 Mail In Ballots)  California does, in fact, does require signature verification for mail-in ballots. California’s Code of Regulations state that election officials “must compare the signature on a voted vote-by-mail envelope and a voted provisional ballot envelope to the voter’s signature(s) in the voter’s registration record prior to counting a ballot.” The regulations outline the signature verification process takes place for mail-in ballots, as well as require signature verification for an “initiative, referendum, recall, nominating petition or paper, signature in-lieu of filing fee, and any other petition or paper.” There was an update to signature verification processes by the California Secretary of State before the 2020 general election to make the process more uniform throughout the state’s 58 counties, The Los Angeles Magazine reported. Additionally, the California Secretary of State’s news office Twitter account tweeted that signature verification was used to verify mail-in ballots.

California news outlets such as the Sacramento Bee and KQED reported about the state’s vote-by-mail process, including signature verification, ahead of the 2020 general election. The Los Angeles Times also published an article about mail-in ballot signature verification. Over 99 percent of the more than 15 million mail-in ballots in California were verified and counted in the 2020 general election, with most rejections stemming from signatures not matching those on record, The Associated Press reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image on the right has been flipped to make it seem like Biden is signing with his left hand. Photos and videos from the same day show him signing with his right hand, and he has said he is not left-handed.   Fact Check: The post attempts to juxtapose two photos of Biden, one from years ago and one from 2021, to suggest that the more recent picture shows a body double disguised as the president. In the photo on the left, Biden is signing a document with his right hand, whereas, in the photo on the right, he appears to be signing an executive order with his left hand. “Okay folk’s (sic) here is the deal in 2008 Joe Biden is right handed,” reads the text accompanying the pictures. “Joe Biden in 2021 is left handed. The stories are true our President is a body double.”  Both pictures are real; however, the one on the right has been flipped to misleadingly make it seem like he is signing with the opposite hand. The original image appears to have been taken by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci on Jan. 20, the day Biden was inaugurated. In the original, the folders and American flag are on Biden’s right, and he is signing with his right hand. Other photos the same day show Biden signing documents with his right hand. In footage posted on PBS NewsHour and CNBC Television’s respective YouTube channels, he can also be seen signing executive orders right-handed on Jan. 20.  Furthermore, Biden said in a 2020 interview for Wired that he is not left-handed. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden ‘Quietly’ Pardon 2,617 Black Lives Matter Protesters?) The other picture in the Facebook post shows Biden signing a “condolence book at the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C., April 14, 2010,” according to its description on the Obama White House Flickr account. It was taken by White House photographer David Lienemann. Check Your Fact has previously debunked digitally altered images of Biden. For instance, social media users shared an image that falsely claimed to show him wearing a walking boot on his left foot instead of his right.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The black-and-white photo shows five uniformed workers standing around a woman. A sign in front of the group reads, “Miss Lube Rack.” Text accompanying the photo attempts to suggest that the woman pictured is Pelosi. However, the photo does not show a young Pelosi. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo on Getty Images’ website where its description revealed the photo was taken in 1951 as part of the LIFE picture collection.  “Muller’s Car Wash employees pose with beauty contest participant, ‘Miss Lube Rack,’ Hollywood, California, 1951,” the original photo’s caption reads. (RELATED: Is Nancy Pelosi’s Chief Of Staff Also The CEO Of Dominion Voting Systems?) While Check Your Fact was unable to identify the woman in the picture, there is no indication it is Pelosi. She was born in Baltimore in 1940, according to the U.S. Congress Biographical Directory, so she would have only been 10 or 11 years old in 1951. An internet search further found no credible record of Pelosi ever assuming the title “Miss Lube Rack” in a contest in California or elsewhere. Pelosi didn’t move to California until 1969 when she moved to San Francisco with her husband and five children, Business Insider reported. The Business Insider article includes a photo of Pelosi at age 20, at President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural ball in 1961, which clearly distinguishes her from the woman in the Facebook photo.

Get a job’ – Did Kamala Harris Make This Statement About Veterans Affairs?,2021-02-16,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: ‘So Here’s A Message To The Soldier Boys. Get a job’ – Did Kamala Harris Make This Statement About Veterans Affairs?1:21 PM 02/16/2021Trevor Schakohl | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA viral Facebook post attributes to Vice President Kamala Harris a quote about veterans and shutting down Department of Veterans Affairs facilities that reads in part, “So here’s a message to the soldier boys. Get a job.”  Verdict: False Harris never said the quote. It originated from a satire website.   Fact Check: The Feb. 14 post credits Harris with making a comment about President Joe Biden’s administration “shuttering the VA, taking away soldier welfare” within the next four years. It alleges Harris announced that they would reallocate the money “to better use in assisting refugee families.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Paris Police Clashing With Refugees?) “The United States government cannot continue to pay for the every need of what has become a special class of citizen. Veterans are equal to us, not better than. Veterans Affairs coddles them,” Harris is quoted as saying in part. “It creates a dependency upon us which is not doing these former soldiers any good. They need to learn to live on their own two feet and be responsible adults. The easiest way to assist them on this journey is to cut them off.”  In reality, there is no record of Harris making the comment attributed to her in the Facebook post. It doesn’t appear in any of her social media posts, in transcripts housed on the White House website or in her remarks documented in the Congressional Record. Check Your Fact also didn’t find any military-focused media outlets such as the Military Times, Stars and Stripes and Defense News attributing the quote to her as of Feb. 16. While campaigning for president in 2019, Harris pledged in a Medium post to expand Veterans Affairs health care and housing assistance access to over 500,000 veterans that received “other-than-honorable” discharges. She also proposed creating a grant program to give communities the resources to help provide transitional housing to veterans that need it. The fabricated statement appears to have originated in a satire article published by America’s Last Line of Defense. Check Your Fact previously debunked a false claim about Biden announcing he would defund the Department of Veterans Affairs that originated on the same website. America’s Last Line of Defense describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” “Everything on this website is fiction,” the website disclaims. “It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/doug.johnson.33234/posts/3833257586734244,https://www.facebook.com/doug.johnson.33234/posts/3833257586734244,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/18/fact-check-video-paris-police-clashing-refugees/,https://www.facebook.com/doug.johnson.33234/posts/3833257586734244,https://www.facebook.com/page/24413227922/search?q=%22So%20here%E2%80%99s%20a%20message%20to%20the%20soldier%20boys%22,https://www.facebook.com/page/102479025168087/search/?q=%22So%20here%E2%80%99s%20a%20message%20to%20the%20soldier%20boys%22,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22So%20here%E2%80%99s%20a%20message%20to%20the%20soldier%20boys%22%20(from%3AKamalaHarris%20OR%20from%3AVP)&src=typed_query,https://www.whitehouse.gov/?s=So+here%E2%80%99s+a+message+to+the+soldier+boys,https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/congressional-record?wordsPhrases=%22get+a+job%22&wordVariants=on&congresses%5B%5D=all&dates=datesCongress&sectionDailyDigest=on&sectionSenate=on&sectionExtensionsOfRemarks=on&representative%5B%5D=&senator%5B%5D=H001075&searchResultViewType=compact,https://www.militarytimes.com/search/kamala+harris+get+a+jobkamala+harris+get+a+job/?q=kamala+harris+get+a+job,https://www.stripes.com/search-7.269?q=%22So+here%E2%80%99s+a+message+to+the+soldier+boys%22,https://www.defensenews.com/search/kamala+harris+get+a+job/?q=kamala+harris+get+a+job,https://kamalaharris.medium.com/kamalas-promise-to-america-s-veterans-and-military-families-176628ca018f,https://kamalaharris.medium.com/kamalas-promise-to-america-s-veterans-and-military-families-176628ca018f,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/kamala-va-shut-down/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/11/fact-check-joe-biden-defund-veterans-affairs/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/about-us/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/about-us/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#95e1e7f0e3fae7d5f6fdf0f6feecfae0e7f3f4f6e1bbf6faf8",‘So Here’s A Message To The Soldier Boys.

Verdict: False While Nabisco is closing two plants, it is not moving the jobs to Mexico, according to Nabisco’s parent company. There is no indication the closures are related to Biden’s election.   Fact Check: Mondelēz International, the parent company of Nabisco, announced Feb. 4 that it would be closing two biscuit bakeries in the U.S. – one in Atlanta, Georgia, and one in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Mondelēz International had previously warned in a November 2020 statement that it was considering closing the two Nabisco locations. Now, a Feb. 7 Facebook post claims those bakeries will be moving to Mexico and that the closures and move are a result of Biden being president. The post reads, “Nabisco closing plants in Georgia and New Jersey moving to Mexico congratulations on electing Biden.”  However, the bakeries are not moving to Mexico, according to a statement from the company. Mondelēz International’s Feb. 4 statement, which did not mention Biden or his administration, said, “The company remains committed to the United States, as well as to robust U.S. biscuit manufacturing. No U.S. jobs will go to Mexico related to these two closures and U.S. biscuit production levels will be maintained.” The statement further read: “Though details of manufacturing transition plans are still being finalized, production from Atlanta and Fair Lawn will shift to other Mondelēz owned-and-operated bakeries in the U.S. and U.S.-based external manufacturing.” It also said that the Fair Lawn and Atlanta bakeries are “no longer strategic assets from a geographic footprint perspective, and both face significant operational challenges, including aging infrastructure and outdated production capabilities, which would have required significant investment to bring them to the modernized state required for the future.” When reached for comment, Laurie Guzzinati, the senior director of corporate and government affairs in North America at Mondelēz Global, directed Check Your Fact to statements given to Reuters and USA Today. (RELATED: Is The Cheesecake Factory Closing All Of Its Locations?) “Neither of those [claims in the posts] are accurate,” she told Reuters. Guzzinati also confirmed to USA Today that Biden’s election did not have anything to do with Nabisco closing the plants. The Nabisco closure in Fair Lawn, which will occur by the end of the summer, will leave up to 600 people jobless, according to The Associated Press. The plant closure in Atlanta will result in about 400 jobs lost, Fox 5 Atlanta reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a viral 2018 tweet that features pictures of Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The library houses “one of the largest and most dynamic collections of rare books and manuscripts in the world,” including an original Gutenberg Bible, according to its website. The tweet claims that “if a fire starts in the library, all the oxygen leaves the building killing all who are inside in order to protect the rare books.” That claim, however, is incorrect, according to the communications director for the library.  “It is false information,” said Michael Morand, the communications for Beinecke Library, in an email to Check Your Fact. “Like scores of cultural heritage institutions, this library uses a clean agent fire suppression system that is safe for humans.” The Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA) describes clean agents as “gaseous fire suppressing agents” that have undergone “extensive toxicity testing to prove they are compatible with people and safe to use in occupied areas.” Morand told Check Your Fact that the library “upgraded the clean agent first suppression system to Ecaro” five years ago, when the library underwent renovations, and that it is a “widely-used, safe, and greener fire protection system.” The FSSA states on its website that clean agents such as Ecaro are “safe for humans.” Ecaro “extinguishes a fire by a combination of chemical and physical mechanisms” and is “safe for use in occupied spaces without fear of oxygen deprivation,” according to information on the website of ORR Protection Systems, a company that specializes in fire protection equipment. Prior to the renovations in 2016, the library also utilized a human-safe fire suppression system. Stephen Jones, the former head of access services at Beinecke Library, told Yale Daily News in 2010 that the library had a fire-extinguishing system that used a “combination of halon and Inergen gases” to combat any potential fire. Inergen is a “breathable gaseous extinguishing agent” that reduces the oxygen concentration and increases the carbon dioxide concentration in the air to prevent fire while “allowing persons to breathe as they egress the hazard area,” according to a document from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “They do lower the percentage of oxygen, but not enough to kill any librarians,” Jones told Yale Daily News in 2010.

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Reeves made the remarks. They appear to have originated from a website that has previously published misinformation. Fact Check:   The image, which includes a photo of Reeves, attributes to the actor several quotes, including that “some of these guys carry around bottles of blood” and that “they call it ‘red wine.'” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Justin Bieber Said ‘Hollywood Elites’ Killed His Unborn Child) “They see it as the ultimate high,” Reeves allegedly said. “They say it gives them life. The more the child suffered, the more fear and hormonal adrenaline it had in its system at the time of death, the stronger the effect on the people who consume that blood. They live for this stuff.” While Reeves does not appear to have any verified social media accounts, there is no record of him making the comments about Hollywood elites using the “blood of babies” to get high. A search of news articles turned up media outlets debunking the quotes in 2017. The fabricated statements seem to reference the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that former President Donald Trump is fighting a “deep state” cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles in politics, business, and Hollywood, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The quotes appear to have originated in a November 2017 article published by YourNewsWire, a website that, according to the Poynter Institute, has published misinformation in the past. The YourNewsWire article falsely alleged Reeves made the comments during an interview in Milan, Italy. He was in Milan in November that year to unveil custom motorcycles that he created, but media outlets that covered the unveiling did not quote him as making the comments at the time. This isn’t the first time social media users have shared a false claim that originated on YourNewsWire.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Biden “quietly” pardoned over 2,600 Black Lives Matter protesters. The claim appears to originate from a satire article.   Fact Check: The Washington Post estimated that 14,000 arrests occurred across 49 cities nationwide during the anti-racism protests sparked last summer by the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Now, a post on Facebook alleges that Biden exercised his presidential power to pardon over 2,600 protesters involved with the Black Lives Matter movement. “Well, well, well, Biden quietly pardoned 2,617 BLM protestors!” the post reads. “Once again, is he a president for all! I feel like we patriots should take to the streets and protest the double standard in Washington! I feel like we patriots should take to the streets and protest the double standard in Washington!”  In reality, there is no evidence that Biden pardoned 2,617 protesters. The Justice Department’s website doesn’t mention Biden having granted any pardons or commutations as of Feb. 15. The White House website’s list of presidential actions didn’t include any entry about him granting pardons either. A wider internet search turned up no media reports of Biden taking such action, only media outlets debunking the claim. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Cancel $250 Million For Historically Black Colleges And Universities?)

The rumor appears to stem from a satire article.   Fact Check:  Lindell, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, has propagated several baseless claims about widespread election fraud, leading to his personal account as well as MyPillow’s corporate account being banned on Twitter in January, according to The Washington Post. He has blamed “undercover Antifa that dressed up as Trump people” for the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Business Insider reported. This particular Facebook post claims that Lindell has further stated the Capitol rioters were “drugged by ‘antifa sluts.'”  In reality, there is no indication that Lindell claimed “antifa sluts” drugged rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6. A review of his 2-hour election fraud special, “Absolute Proof,” showed no instances of Lindell making the claim. Check Your Fact also reviewed archived screen grabs of both the MyPillow corporate Twitter account and Lindell’s personal Twitter account, but found no matches for the term “Antifa sluts” in tweets from either account. A wider internet search found no media reports of Lindell claiming “antifa sluts” were responsible for drugging rioters at the Capitol, only other outlets debunking the claim. (RELATED: Fact-Checking My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell’s ‘Absolute Proof’ Election Fraud Special) The claim appears to stem from an article published by The Business Standard News that put up the headline “Lindell: Capitol Rioters Were Drugged By Antifa Sluts.” In the “About” section of The Business Standard News website, the outlet describes itself as “a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle.” While the The Business Standard News clearly discloses the satirical nature of the article, some Facebook users have shared the claim without a warning, a common way for misinformation to spread online.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/bonnie.clayton.12979/posts/102001135264354,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/02/01/mypillow-twitter-account-suspended-ban-evasion-mike-lindell-trump/4348778001/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/26/mypillow-ceo-lindell-twitter-ban/,https://www.businessinsider.com/mypillow-trump-capitol-riots-mike-lindell-discount-code-2021-1,https://www.facebook.com/bonnie.clayton.12979/posts/102001135264354,https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=901573193944715&ref=watch_permalink,https://web.archive.org/web/20210131195434/http://twitter.com/mypillowusa,https://web.archive.org/web/20210121014934/https://twitter.com/realMikeLindell,https://www.google.com/search?q=Mike+Lindell+%22Antifa+sluts%22&sxsrf=ALeKk03J5t5tQ8bEEfYyshjp4JYYoGr61g:1613087574445&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjm0va-g-PuAhXSvJ4KHUxGCsUQ_AUoAnoECAYQBA&biw=1162&bih=689,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/05/fact-check-mike-lindell-absolute-proof-election-fraud/,https://thebiznews.org/2021/02/05/lindell-capitol-rioters-were-drugged-by-antifa-sluts/,https://thebiznews.org/about-news/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e5e3f4e7fee3d1f2f9f4f2fae8fee4e3f7f0f2e5bff2fefc",Did My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell Say The Capitol Rioters Were Drugged By ‘Antifa Sluts’?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The act does not allow Trump to retain control of the military after his term ended. The full transition of power occurred on Jan. 20, when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.   Fact Check: In addition to making the claim about the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act of 2019, the image attempts to suggest that the U.S. Constitution prescribes that the transfer of power between presidents does not actually occur until March. Trump signed the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act, which amended the 1963 Presidential Transition Act, into law in March 2020. It includes measures such as setting a timeline for the General Services Administration (GSA) to “enter into memorandums of understanding with Presidential campaigns to prepare for potential transitions” and limiting the “period during which services and facilities are provided to Presidential transition teams” by the GSA to 60 days after inauguration, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Nowhere in the text of the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act does it afford the former president the ability to remain in control of the military after the new president’s inauguration. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Joe Biden Asleep In The Oval Office?) The 20th Amendment states, “The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January.” The full transition of power from Trump to Biden occurred on Jan. 20, when he was sworn in as the 46th president. Biden also became the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military upon his inauguration, as prescribed in the Constitution. It seems that the post’s claims are linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Some believers in the conspiracy theory falsely say that Trump will be sworn back into office March 4, according to CNN. Prior to the ratification of the 20th Amendment, the president was inaugurated on March 4, according to the Library of Congress. On Jan. 13, Trump was impeached by the House for the second time on one count of incitement of insurrection, according to The New York Times. His second impeachment came a week after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6. The Senate voted Feb. 9 that the former president’s impeachment trial is constitutional, according to NPR.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Sheila Jackson Lee said, “Homicide is the leading cause of murder.” Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of Jackson Lee making the comment. The quotation likely stems from an article on a satire website. Fact Check:   Jackson Lee was first elected to Congress to represent Texas’ 18th congressional district in 1994, the Houston Chronicle reported. A post on Facebook attributes to Jackson Lee the quote, “Homicide is the lead cause of murder.” (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Say, ‘There Are Homeless People Out There Who Can’t Pay Their Mortgage’?) But there is no record of Jackson Lee making the comment. A search of the congressional record showed no instances of the congresswoman making the remark. The comment likewise does not appear in any of her social media posts. A wider internet search by Check Your Fact found no record of the quote being attributed to Jackson Lee in media reports either. The quote has been misattributed to Jackson Lee on social media since at least 2015. The claim appears to stem from a December 2015 article published on the now-defunct website The Habanero of Texas titled, “Sheila Jackson Lee Identifies Homicide As Leading Cause Of Murders.”  The article is labeled as “Sheila Jackson Lee Parody.” An archived page from The Habanero of Texas website reads: “MOST content found in the Satire Category, including persons names, locations and anything else are used for satirical and entertainment purposes. The satire stories are Not Real, and some content found in parodies are based on real stories, but are exaggerated with humor.” While the original article contains disclaimers of its satirical nature, Facebook users have continued to share the quote without such a warning, seemingly believing the quote to be factual. Jackson Lee, in 2013, did speak about homicide as a cause of death in an interview with Blaze Media, where she quoted a statistic saying, “Homicide is the leading cause of death — second-leading cause of death — for young people ages 15 to 24. In my community, African Americans, it is the leading cause of death for those 10 to 24.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/howard.measel.7/posts/118577753501335,https://jacksonlee.house.gov/about/full-biography,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/article/Reps-Sheila-Jackson-Lee-and-Al-Green-build-big-15103113.php,https://www.facebook.com/howard.measel.7/posts/118577753501335,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/30/fact-check-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-homeless-people-pay-mortgage/,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22congrecord%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22Homicide%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20murder%5C%22%22%7D&searchResultViewType=expanded,https://www.facebook.com/page/552403241860058/search/?q=Homicide%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20murder,https://www.facebook.com/page/169479190984/search/?q=Homicide%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20murder,https://twitter.com/search?q=Homicide%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20murder%20(from%3AJacksonLeeTX18%20OR%20from%3Asjl4hrc)&src=typed_query,https://www.google.com/search?q=Jackson+Lee+%22Homicide+is+the+leading+cause+of+murder%22&source=lmns&tbm=nws&bih=688&biw=1084&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdrYuBpuDuAhWxn3IEHTJqC94Q_AUoAXoECAEQAQ,https://www.facebook.com/leo.pusateri/posts/10156417337210226,https://www.facebook.com/davefury72/posts/10153145924706540,https://web.archive.org/web/20170219012718/http://thehabanerooftexas.com/2015/12/04/sheila-jackson-lee-homicide/,https://thehabanerooftexas.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/congresswoman-identifies-homicide-as-leading-cause-of-most-murders-in-america/,https://archive.fo/adTaC#selection-545.37-545.310,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/05/04/dem-congresswoman-admits-to-theblaze-she-would-vote-for-national-gun-registry-it-helps-us-find-them-for-you,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2e5a5c4b58415c6e4d464b4d4557415b5c484f4d5a004d4143","Did Sheila Jackson Lee Say, ‘Homicide Is The Leading Cause Of Murder’?",,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Biden canceled $250 million in funding for HBCUs. The president has called for increased investment into such institutions.   Fact Check: Biden has signed dozens of executive actions since being sworn in as the 46th president on Jan. 20. Now, multiple Facebook users are claiming he “cancelled the 250 million $$$ Trump gave to Black Colleges.” The $250-million figure mentioned in the post appears to refer to annual funding authorized in the FUTURE Act. The bipartisan bill, which Trump signed into law in December 2019, permanently authorized $255 million a year for HBCUs and other minority-serving educational institutions, the Associated Press reported.  Check Your Fact didn’t find any evidence in sources such as Biden’s executive orders and the White House’s press releases that Biden has revoked the funding. A move to that effect would also likely prompt coverage from major media outlets, none of which appears to have reported such a thing. Furthermore, a Department of Education spokesperson confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the post’s claim is false. (RELATED: Is Shell Laying Off 9,000 Workers Because Of Joe Biden?) Biden has expressed support for federal investment into HBCUs. For example, a fact sheet on the White House website says Biden is “committed to working with Congress” to pass legislation that “advances racial equity, including increasing funding for small businesses, investing in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions, and tripling funding for Title I schools.” “Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative – how much more creative and innovative we’d be if this nation held – held the historic black colleges and universities to the same opportunities – and minority-serving institutions – that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future,” Biden said Jan. 26 at the signing of executive actions aimed at promoting racial equity, according to a White House transcript. The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2020 that Biden proposed $70 billion in federal investment for HBCUs and other institutions that serve many minority students. On his presidential campaign website, Biden also pledged to “reduce disparities” in federal funding for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions.

The claim appears to have originated on a satire website.   Fact Check: It’s a long-standing tradition for professional and collegiate sports teams to be invited to the White House to meet the president after they win championships, according to ESPN. During former President Donald Trump’s administration, several teams and players refused to attend such ceremonies, Business Insider reported. (RELATED: Did Tom Brady Say, ‘If Anybody On This Team Kneels, I Walk’?) This particular Facebook post claims the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the winners of Super Bowl LV, refused their invitation to the White House because they claim it was “stolen.” Trump has asserted that the 2020 presidential election was rigged in favor of Biden, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to The Associated Press.  There is no indication, however, that the team has declined to visit the White House or Biden. When athletes decline invitations to meet with the president, it typically garners media attention. Had the Buccaneers decided not to visit the White House, there would be media reports on it, yet there are none. Check Your Fact also looked through press releases from the Buccaneers, but found no announcement of their refusal to visit the White House. A search of the team’s verified social media accounts likewise turned up no announcement. The claim may stem from an article posted on the satirical website TaterForce One which bears the headline, “Superbowl Champions Refuse Invitation to ‘Stolen’ White House.” While TaterForce One clearly discloses the satirical nature of its work, some Facebook users have shared the claim without such a warning, seemingly believing it to be true. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Lakers, the 2020 NBA champions, would be invited to the White House once it was “COVID safe,” according to Yahoo News.         share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:   The tweet, purportedly sent by Gorilla Glue, seemingly references the situation of Tessica Brown, a Louisiana woman who said in social media videos that she used Gorilla Glue adhesive spray instead of hairspray about a month ago to style her hair. Her plight to remove the adhesive spray from her hair has gone viral. In recent days, people have been sharing the alleged Gorilla Glue tweet on Facebook, appearing to believe that the company actually tweeted, “We never thought we’d have to say this, but do  not use our products on your fucking hair.” However, a search of Gorilla Glue’s Twitter account yielded no matches for the statement. It also cannot be found on archived versions of the company’s Twitter timeline that are available on the Wayback Machine. Closer inspection of the image being shared reveals it has been fabricated.  Gorilla Glue’s Twitter account @GorillaGlue is not verified and does not have a space in its handle. Twitter’s help center states that handles “can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores – no spaces are allowed.” “This appears to be a photoshopped image of our account,” Melanie Blumental, manager of digital, social and public relations at Gorilla Glue, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email. “We did not author this tweet.” In a Feb. 8 tweet, Gorilla Glue shared a statement addressing Brown’s situation without profanity.

Our spray adhesive states in the warning label ‘do not swallow.

Verdict: False   There is no evidence Biden has made such an announcement. The claim originated from a satirical website. Fact Check:  The Feb. 11 Facebook post appears to show a screen grab of an article that says Biden “has announced that he will immediately defund the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.” It also attributes a quote to the 46th president: “They knew what they were signing up for.”  There is, however, no indication Biden has announced such a thing or made the comment credited to him in the post. Check Your Fact didn’t find any announcements to that effect on the White House website or in Factba.se, an online database that collects Biden’s public remarks. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Say, ‘Our Military Are Soulless Cowards’?) Instead, Biden proposed on his presidential campaign website to “restore the VA as the premier agency for ensuring our veterans’ well-being.” His proposal included “providing veterans world class health care to meet their specific needs,” “creating meaningful employment and educational opportunities” and “improving VA management and accountability.” Through a keyword search, Check Your Fact found that the Facebook post lifts word-for-word from an article titled “Biden to Defund the Department of Veterans Affairs” that was published by America’s Last Line of Defense. On the website’s “About Us” page, it describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The satirical article can be found in the “Biden Satire For Delusional Trumpsters To Hate” category. Despite America’s Last Line of Defense disclaiming that its content is satirical, some Facebook users shared the story without a similar disclaimer, a common way misinformation spreads online.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatthew SchochContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10219190293014779&set=basw.AbodfapZ681g7LQJXP41wl2vyprG5dWX3xdtynwWEAHoXvLIJet11NlJyQIMmt_XDo0VDQrIYCByMqjyMfpFSQIGB44akGPbMnx-Ux1zhKsSEBZm5DlXV3JKqSZHq8bdKXvR_pI6z4QWpg9zFd6hlz6GrayDv5c-13Zf20P09bGLMw&opaqueCursor=AbpfVlmt5d9TwhxTQqvy8RS3rqUmEDhQCumyD943DkaJJ11bAdA0UnaB5TejD3_F8bYmxCT7PSTFids7jepvjFs0uM8fyHU7dI42hhalPrl_wNMGocQiBkxzM6NEbrNXv1ceQZLdwp4CPIW_4QwSmUusfwuXfaEb063UOGNodIkATjmF5GCW4PxqLcp5aLVGhop1ewUxZJoo4yGILIDdrWtE1bm3d8SSGtn0iIHQA6sv4e9lpCP63snEbwSTd3NvU3dOjMDLowyXvs124cYi5cuaDEgiA0erxuNG9Es7XlEkQ8n0ApwNdJUyEsE1yi6eMUHBEJHEHZgIpXm-w8e0sHDgLWwL5wSudfMqNMH8Ti-gLBvQ3JwXb-lKGoqq7GT4T-r1yvwEgNJTYYU7Zq2aGwfV4lWWY3ifFtWRvkg8z4bjKwL7ULnmaWASJphoZnt1uCwRJl-mOyBmMsV4jhjGXBnZUYFXQryDWPfKtjCSvX7KNh6Yr9gc2xmVYivkC0TetdVEU44w64fs6cq5uiCIeWXXTzScpoRqHzmZI5hqAI9f_BG4VFejGtWf_oPUNb-Y54iAF3ajnBs5CPGZWIONS0Nf1wWCYuoRAUWjx7HQi5ItC6qzu1QO_d8N8YEFWpQuHMLag6-3044Njw6uaYzkQ5Epa66e2wgOV2YxrHeapBIrmiTAHRsloLEa4CrsVTeY82pEHYvWaqx-Dqlo4b0JdaTmeJBCXfQVbQ18mlGu0pJwiZFub5J8TBhNW-L2bCA04ZAusu8j1aNRxzEpeJlxkapY,https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10219190293014779&set=basw.AbodfapZ681g7LQJXP41wl2vyprG5dWX3xdtynwWEAHoXvLIJet11NlJyQIMmt_XDo0VDQrIYCByMqjyMfpFSQIGB44akGPbMnx-Ux1zhKsSEBZm5DlXV3JKqSZHq8bdKXvR_pI6z4QWpg9zFd6hlz6GrayDv5c-13Zf20P09bGLMw&opaqueCursor=AbpfVlmt5d9TwhxTQqvy8RS3rqUmEDhQCumyD943DkaJJ11bAdA0UnaB5TejD3_F8bYmxCT7PSTFids7jepvjFs0uM8fyHU7dI42hhalPrl_wNMGocQiBkxzM6NEbrNXv1ceQZLdwp4CPIW_4QwSmUusfwuXfaEb063UOGNodIkATjmF5GCW4PxqLcp5aLVGhop1ewUxZJoo4yGILIDdrWtE1bm3d8SSGtn0iIHQA6sv4e9lpCP63snEbwSTd3NvU3dOjMDLowyXvs124cYi5cuaDEgiA0erxuNG9Es7XlEkQ8n0ApwNdJUyEsE1yi6eMUHBEJHEHZgIpXm-w8e0sHDgLWwL5wSudfMqNMH8Ti-gLBvQ3JwXb-lKGoqq7GT4T-r1yvwEgNJTYYU7Zq2aGwfV4lWWY3ifFtWRvkg8z4bjKwL7ULnmaWASJphoZnt1uCwRJl-mOyBmMsV4jhjGXBnZUYFXQryDWPfKtjCSvX7KNh6Yr9gc2xmVYivkC0TetdVEU44w64fs6cq5uiCIeWXXTzScpoRqHzmZI5hqAI9f_BG4VFejGtWf_oPUNb-Y54iAF3ajnBs5CPGZWIONS0Nf1wWCYuoRAUWjx7HQi5ItC6qzu1QO_d8N8YEFWpQuHMLag6-3044Njw6uaYzkQ5Epa66e2wgOV2YxrHeapBIrmiTAHRsloLEa4CrsVTeY82pEHYvWaqx-Dqlo4b0JdaTmeJBCXfQVbQ18mlGu0pJwiZFub5J8TBhNW-L2bCA04ZAusu8j1aNRxzEpeJlxkapY,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/,https://factba.se/biden/search#defund,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/23/fact-check-kamala-harris-military-soulless-cowards-budget-cut-facebook-post/,https://joebiden.com/veterans/,https://joebiden.com/veterans/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/biden-to-defund-the-department-of-veterans-affairs/?fbclid=IwAR2xw_p-nCyOSsxOarbzSGkZbtgqvuzJ-BrOUyQ6aY2jVedfSLZg5kNKgcA,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/about-us/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/category/biden-satire-for-delusional-trumpsters-to-hate/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/about-us/",Did Joe Biden Announce He Will Defund The Department Of Veterans Affairs?,,,,,,

Fact Check: Social media users and Biden’s opponents have often removed context around remarks made by Biden, who has had a speech impediment since he was a child, as a way to question his mental fitness, according to The Washington Post. This particular Facebook post alleges Biden once messed up the well-known saying “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” “Buy a man eat fish, he day, teach fish man, to a lifetime,” the post claims Biden said. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Say That He If He Was President, There Would Have Been Zero COVID-19 Deaths?)  There is, however, no evidence Biden made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. Media outlets often report when Biden makes verbal stumbles in his speech, so it is likely that if he had made the comment, there would be reporting on it, yet there is none. Check Your Fact also conducted a search of Biden’s verified social media accounts, but found no instances of the inaccurate quote. A search of “statements and releases” published by the White House during Biden’s presidency likewise turned up no matches for the remark. There is also no record of it in Factba.se, an online database that collects Biden’s public statements. This is not the first time a quote has been misattributed to Biden. In October 2020, Check Your Fact debunked the false claim that Biden said that if he was president, there would have been zero COVID-19 deaths.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The company announced the job cuts in September 2020, before the presidential election. A Shell spokesperson said the post’s claim is “inaccurate.”   Fact Check:  Facebook users have been sharing an image that inaccurately alleges Shell is laying off thousands of workers because of Biden and his administration, despite the energy firm announcing the job cuts before the 2020 presidential election. Shell announced at the end of September 2020 that it plans to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs, according to BBC News and Reuters. Ben van Beurden, the CEO of Shell, said in an interview published on the company’s website Sept. 30, 2020, that the layoffs will occur “by the end of 2022.”  “We do not have an exact figure because the details are still being worked out, and we have never had a target to reduce a particular number of jobs. But we can say that, because of the efficiencies we expect to gain, we will reduce between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022,” van Beurden said. “This includes around 1,500 people who have already agreed to take voluntary redundancy this year, but excludes any who may leave Shell because of divestments.” Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, also told Check Your Fact that the Facebook post is “inaccurate.” (RELATED: ‘The US Became A Net Oil Exporter For The First Time In 75 Years’) “The assertion that Shell is eliminating jobs as a result of moves made by the Biden Administration is inaccurate,” Smith said in an email. “In September of 2020, Shell announced up to 9,000 positions would be eliminated as part of a broader effort to reduce costs, simplify the company’s structure and accelerate investments in lower-carbon energy products.” The presidential election occurred on Nov. 3, 2020, roughly a month after Shell had announced the job cuts. The Associated Press and other media outlets declared Biden the projected winner four days later on Nov. 7. Shell had previously committed in April 2020 to becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050, Reuters reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False OpIndia has refuted claims that it published the story. The pictured article, which contains a doctored photo of Thunberg in a hijab, has been fabricated.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of an article purportedly published by the Indian news outlet OpIndia. The supposed article features two pictures of Thunberg: one allegedly showing her wearing a green hijab and one showing her speaking into a microphone. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Justin Trudeau Participating In A Protest In Support Of Indian Farmers?) A search of OpIndia’s website showed no such article. In fact, the outlet actually published two articles on Feb. 6 in which it called the screen grab “fake” and refuted that it had published the article. OpIndia editor Nupur Sharma also refuted the claim on Twitter, saying in part, “That’s a fake image, you elephantine moron.”  The screen grab of the fake article contains an altered image. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that Thunberg’s face has been superimposed onto an image of a woman in a hijab published by Agoeng Adry Irawan, an Indonesian-based photographer. The doctored picture of Thunberg in the hijab in the fabricated article shows a “SecretNews” watermark. Secret News, a French satirical website, describes itself as “a free and independent collaborative parody medium bringing together several contributors.” The satirical website included the altered photo in an October 2019 article. Thunberg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2003, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica website. Her parents are opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg, and she has a younger sister, BBC News and Time Magazine reported. She first gained global recognition for skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament and has since become a prominent environmental activist.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The Weeknd’s Super Bowl performance did not include any instances of the word “Satan” appearing on a video screen. The image comes from a 2017 concert The Weeknd performed in Copenhagen, Denmark.   Fact Check: The Weeknd, known for songs such as “Starboy” and “Blinding Lights,” headlined the halftime show for the Feb. 7 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Shortly thereafter, an image began circulating on Facebook and Twitter that allegedly showed the word “Satan” being flashed on a screen during the performance. However, the claim that the word “Satan” was displayed during The Weeknd’s halftime performance doesn’t hold up. Check Your Fact reviewed the entirety of his performance and didn’t find a single instance of the word appearing on a video screen. (RELATED: Did In-N-Out Burger Print ‘Hail Satan’ On Its Soda Cups?)  The image in the screen grabbed tweet that was shared on Facebook actually comes from a 2017 concert at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen. In videos taken by fans and uploaded to YouTube, the word “Satan” can briefly be seen on the screen behind The Weeknd while he performs the song “Reminder.”  It’s unclear why The Weeknd included the flashing of the word “Satan” in his 2017 performance.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The image has been digitally manipulated to include an ankle monitor. In the original photo, Clinton is not wearing anything on her left ankle. Fact Check:   The image of Clinton allegedly wearing an ankle monitor while walking outside with another woman has circulated on Facebook in recent days. However, a reverse image search revealed that the image has been digitally altered to include the device. The Daily Mail published the unaltered picture in an August 2019 article about Clinton vacationing in Amagansett, New York. In the original photo, which the Daily Mail credited to Splashnews.com, there is nothing visible on either of Clinton’s ankles. Other photos from the same day in August 2019 that the Daily Mail published also show Clinton wasn’t wearing an ankle monitor. Check Your Fact didn’t find any major media outlets reporting about Clinton being arrested or being ordered to wear an ankle monitor. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims To Show Joe Biden And Hillary Clinton Not Wearing Masks During The COVID-19 Pandemic)  This isn’t the first time social media users have falsely claimed a photo shows Clinton wearing an ankle monitor.

Verdict: False The image has been digitally altered. The image of Biden closing his eyes has been superimposed onto an image of Biden in the Oval Office.   Fact Check: The image shows Biden wearing a suit and a blue tie while sitting in what appears to be the Oval Office. In the photo, Biden’s head is down, and he seems to be asleep. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Joe Biden Sleeping During A Local Television Interview?) “AMERICA IN DECLINE,” text in the image reads. “This decrepit old grifter works MAYBE five hours a day.

Nothing says we threw in the towel better than this nauseating image, the ‘commander in chief’ can’t even stay awake.”  There is a stack of several folders visible on the desk in the image being shared on Facebook, suggesting it comes from Jan. 20, the day Biden was inaugurated. However, Check Your Fact didn’t find any media reports of Biden falling asleep in the Oval Office while signing executive actions that day. Instead, it seems that an older picture of Biden closing his eyes was superimposed onto a recent photo of the president in the Oval Office on Jan. 20. The image of Biden’s eyes being closed appears to come from 2011, when the then-vice president was filmed with his eyes briefly shut while then-President Barack Obama was giving a speech about the national debt, according to footage from ABC News. Video and photos from Jan. 20 show Biden awake and signing executive orders while wearing the same suit and blue tie as pictured in the Facebook image, as well as a face mask. Check Your Fact found no photos from Inauguration Day showing Biden asleep in the Oval Office. This is not the first time social media users shared content claiming to show Biden falling asleep.

It appears to show a May 2019 incident involving a tear gas canister at a Nigerian school.   Fact Check: In the Instagram video, young people can be seen seemingly fleeing a building, with some jumping from a walkway on the building’s second floor. The caption attempts to suggest that the video shows Nigerian students escaping the school to avoid receiving a mandated COVID-19 vaccination. “Students in Nigeria Running Away in Fear and Desperately Jumping From School Building Trying To Avoid Taking Covid Vaccine That was Enforced in Their School,” reads the caption. “Students are aware this vaccine is deadly and is being used to kill black people off.”  Contrary to the post’s claim, the video predates the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19 vaccines. Check Your Fact found that the video has been posted online since at least May 2019, when African outlets published articles about an incident involving a tear gas canister at a school in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. For instance, Pulse.com.gh included the video in a May 26, 2019, article titled “Pandemonium breaks out as Student detonates teargas in school” that reported students fled the school after a student allegedly opened a tear gas canister in a classroom. BBC News Pidgin and the Nigerian outlet The Guardian also reported on the incident. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Thailand’s Health Minister Receiving The COVID-19 Vaccine?)

Verdict: False The photo dates back to January 2020, when nine parents, including the Guatemalan man pictured, were able to reunite with their children.   Fact Check:  President Joe Biden signed an executive order last week establishing a task force to help reunite families that were separated under former President Donald Trump’s administration, according to CBS News. The image, which shows a screen grabbed Feb. 3 tweet, claims to show one of nine parents who were allegedly reunited with their children earlier this month. “Nine parents deported by the Trump administration landed back into the U.S. Wednesday to reunite with children they had not seen in a year and a half,” reads the tweet. “Some of the children were at the airport to greet them, including David Xol’s 9-year-old son Byron.”  However, the photo was not taken in 2021. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image search and found that the image, taken for the Associated Press, dates back to January 2020. David Xol-Cholom, who is pictured hugging his child, and eight other parents who had been deported under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy were able to return to the U.S. in January of last year, the outlet reported. “David Xol-Cholom, of Guatemala hugs his son Byron at Los Angeles International Airport as they reunite after being separated about one and half years ago during the Trump administration’s wide-scale separation of immigrant families, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2020, in Los Angeles,” reads the caption of the Associated Press’ photo. The reunifications occurred after a federal judge found that the families had been unlawfully prevented from seeking asylum by the U.S. government, according to the Associated Press. The outlet also published a YouTube video that shows the parents being reunited with their children, including Xol-Cholom reuniting with his son.  The Twitter user whose tweet was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook later acknowledged in a subsequent tweet that the photo had been miscaptioned. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Migrant Children ‘In Cages In America’?) “It was just brought to my attention that this took place a year ago. But I’m still very happy to have attention brought to this critical topic,” the user tweeted on Feb. 4. “David and Byron were reunited in January 2020 under federal court order, not yesterday.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Walmart being sold to a group of Chinese investors. The claim appears to stem from a satirical website.   Fact Check: The post claims there was an announcement on Jan. 30 that Walmart was being sold to the Chine Investment Group led by CEO Bao Chang for “a world record $535 billion USD.” The post further claims the name of the store will be changed to “China-Direct.” “Today there are over 11,000 Walmart stores located throughout 27 countries, with the number growing every year since the company was founded. Chang insists that the name change will not affect those who shop at the store, though,” the post reads.  Walmart is a publicly traded company, and about half of Walmart’s stocks are owned by the heirs of Walmart founders Sam and James Walton, according to Forbes. There is no evidence the “sale” has taken place. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi Own Stock In Dominion Voting Systems?) Had such a large company like Walmart been sold to a group of investors, major media outlets would have certainly reported on it, yet none have done so. No such sale is mentioned in SEC records, on the Walmart website or in any of its social media posts either. The text in the Facebook post lifts nearly word-for-word from a January 2015 article published on the website Empire News, a website that describes itself as for “entertainment purposes only.” “Our website and social media content uses only fictional names, except in cases of public figure and celebrity parody or satirization,” the website states.”Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/deborah.dayhoff/posts/10226526136006495,https://www.facebook.com/deborah.dayhoff/posts/10226526136006495,https://www.facebook.com/deborah.dayhoff/posts/10226526136006495,https://www.facebook.com/deborah.dayhoff/posts/10226526136006495,https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-history#:~:text=Walmart%20becomes%20a%20publicly%20traded,sold%20at%20%2416.50%20per%20share.,https://www.forbes.com/profile/walton-1/?sh=3c38c716f3f8,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/24/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-own-stock-dominion-voting-systems/,https://www.google.com/search?q=walmart+sold+to+chinese+investment+group&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&oq=walmart+sold+to+Chinese+&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0i22i30l3j0i390l2j69i61.3792j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/q=Walton&page=1&ciks=0000104169&entityName=Walmart%20Inc.%20%20(CIK%200000104169)&category=form-cat2&forms=3%2C%204%2C%205,https://corporate.walmart.com/search?q=sold+535+million,https://www.facebook.com/page/159616034235/search/?q=sold%20535%20million,https://twitter.com/search?q=sold%20535%20million%20(from%3AWalmart)&src=typed_query,https://empirenews.net/walmart-sold-to-chinese-investment-group-for-over-500b/,https://empirenews.net/about-disclaimer/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2a6a0b7a4bda092b1bab7b1b9abbda7a0b4b3b1a6fcb1bdbf",Was Walmart Sold To A Group Of Chinese Investors?,,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence that the WHO stated that there is no longer a need to wear a mask outside of a hospital setting. The screen grab shows an article published by a website that has previously published misinformation.   Fact Check: The image appears to show a screen grab of a Jan. 25 article published on Principia Scientific International, titled “WHO: You Do NOT Need To Wear A Mask,” that purports the WHO made a Jan. 22 announcement that “there is no scientific medical reason for any healthy person to wear a mask outside of a hospital.” While the WHO originally stated in early April 2020 that masks should only be worn by health care workers, people displaying COVID-19 symptoms and caregivers of infected people, the organization updated its stance on mask guidelines in June 2020, stating the general public should wear facing coverings. Since then, the WHO has maintained the same health recommendations that people should wear a face covering in public to protect against the spread of COVID-19.  Had the WHO recently changed its position on mask-wearing, major media outlets would have certainly reported on it, yet none have. Nor did the WHO make such a statement on its verified Twitter account. In fact, the organization recently held a press conference on Jan. 22 to discuss the importance and the effectiveness of wearing masks. “Within our guidance itself it is also worth noting that the use of fabric masks; we recommend a three-layer mask and in our guidance materials we have recommendations on the specifications for filtration for example, what the type of fabric should be for the inner layer, the middle layer and the outer layer,” Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Technical Lead for COVID-19, said during the press conference. “Not all fabric masks are the same and so they need to be produced and made so that they provide the right type of protection and source control.” Principia Scientific International, the website which published the article making the inaccurate claim, has previously published misinformation, according to Science Feedback, which has assessed a few articles from Principia Scientific International as “inaccurate.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Wearing Face Masks Causes Cancer) The WHO has continually advocated the importance of wearing face coverings since June, and its website is regularly updated with up-to-date information about preventative measures against the coronavirus. In addition to wearing face coverings, the WHO recommends practicing social distancing, frequently washing hands and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, among other measures.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatthew SchochContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3838808586183946&set=a.288015371263303&type=3,https://principia-scientific.com/who-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-mask/,https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1274280/retrieve,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/who-updates-guidance-on-masks-heres-what-to-know-now/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks,https://www.google.com/search?q=WHO+says+don%27t+wear+masks&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&oq=WHO+says+don%27t+wear+masks&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.6472j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://twitter.com/search?q=don%27t%20wear%20masks%20(from%3AWHO)&src=typed_query,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/covid-19-virtual-press-conference-transcript---22-january-2021,https://twitter.com/mvankerkhove/status/1352884306927120384,https://sciencefeedback.co/outlet/principia-scientific/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/07/fact-check-masks-cancer-oxygen-deficiency-coronavirus/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public",Did The WHO Say Face Masks No Longer Need To Be Worn?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The magazine cover is fabricated. It was tweeted by a parody Twitter account that has since been suspended.   Fact Check: Tapped by Biden to serve as assistant secretary of health, Levine is poised to potentially become the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate, according to The Washington Post. She formerly served as Pennsylvania’s secretary of health, the Harrisburg-based ABC27 News reported. In recent days, Facebook users have been sharing a screen grab of a Feb. 1 tweet from the Twitter handle @DrRachelLevine that includes a picture of an alleged Vanity Fair magazine issue featuring Levine. The supposed cover also sports text that says “The Sky Is The Limit” and “‘Madam President Levine’ A Leader In The Making.”  “Thank you Vanity Fair for honoring me on the cover of your magazine this March,” the tweet reads. “My dream of becoming @POTUS one day just took a step forward.” (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Send This 2011 Email To Barack Obama Discussing ‘The Pizza Arrangement’?) While some Facebook users appeared to believe that Vanity Fair featured Levine on a recent cover and that Levine tweeted about it, that isn’t actually the case. A review of Vanity Fair’s archive of magazine issues turned up no matching cover. Musician Billie Eilish appeared on the cover of the magazine’s March 2021 issue, while its Holiday 2020/2021 cover featured talk show host Stephen Colbert. The photo of Levine and the text appear to have been photoshopped onto the cover of a magazine. Photographer Daniel Shanken took the picture of Levine for Reuters at the State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in May 2015, according to its caption. It can be found in a June 2015 article titled “Transgender physician breaks barrier in Pennsylvania capital.” The screen grabbed tweet also didn’t come from Levine. The handle of her verified Twitter account is @SecretaryLevine, not @DrRachelLevine. The handle @DrRachelLevine, which has been suspended, disclaimed in its bio that it is a parody account, an archived tweet on the Wayback Machine shows. This isn’t the first time Levine has been the subject of misinformation on social media. Check Your Fact recently debunked an altered photo that falsely claimed to show Levine holding a small dog while standing with two family members.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/louise.illingworth.7/posts/10220591622760661,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/19/rachel-levine-transgender-biden-hhs-pick/,https://www.abc27.com/news/pennsylvania/governor-wolf-to-nominate-alison-beam-his-current-chief-of-staff-to-serve-as-secretary-of-health/,https://www.facebook.com/louise.illingworth.7/posts/10220591622760661,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/26/fact-check-email-hillary-clinton-pizza-arrangement/,https://archive.vanityfair.com/issues/2021,https://archive.vanityfair.com/issue/20210301,https://archive.vanityfair.com/issue/20210101,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pennsylvania-transgender-idUSKBN0OP2HI20150609,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pennsylvania-transgender-idUSKBN0OP2HI20150609,https://twitter.com/secretarylevine?lang=enhttps://twitter.com/secretarylevine?lang=en,https://twitter.com/DrRachelLevine,https://web.archive.org/web/20210201141246/https://twitter.com/DrRachelLevine/status/1356244048919621634,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/02/03/fact-check-rachel-levine-family/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d6a2a4b3a0b9a496b5beb3b5bdafb9a3a4b0b7b5a2f8b5b9bb",Was Rachel Levine Featured On A Vanity Fair Magazine Cover?,,,,,,

Verdict: False While there were protests during Kavanaugh’s confirmation, the photo does not show a scene from one of those demonstrations. It depicts a 2011 protest at the Wisconsin Capitol building in Madison.   Fact Check: The Facebook post attempts to use the photo to draw a comparison between the protests during the 2018 confirmation hearings and the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The image shows an aerial shot of a rotunda packed with people. “Remember when democrat protesters stormed the US Capitol in 2018, took over the US Senate Building, and tried to get into the US Supreme Court during the Kavanaugh confirmations?” text above the picture reads. “Democrat legislators and the MSM cheered it on. If it wasn’t for double standards liberals would have no standards at all.”  While there were demonstrations on Capitol Hill during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, the photo doesn’t show that. Check Your Fact found the picture posted on the Center for Media and Democracy’s PRWatch website, where the caption indicates it was actually taken at Wisconsin’s Capitol during 2011 protests. (RELATED: Was Kavanaugh Accuser Deborah Ramirez A Soros Fellow?) In February 2011, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the Capitol rotunda in Madison to protest against a bill aimed at limiting the collective bargaining rights of many state workers, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. A photo similar to the one being shared on Facebook can also be found on Getty Images, where the caption says, “Thousands of Wisconsin teachers, state workers and unions protest Gov. Walker’s legislation, in the Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, Friday, February 18, 2011.” During Kavanaugh’s confirmation, people protested after Christine Blasey Ford accused the then-Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, an allegation Kavanaugh denied. The protests occurred at Capitol Hill, including inside the Capitol building and a Senate office building, and at the Supreme Court, according to USA Today and NBC News. Over 300 protesters were arrested at Capitol Hill, CNN reported. Four people died during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to The New York Times. Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died the next day from injuries sustained while engaging with rioters, the outlet reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence the supposed Cabinet Office document is authentic. A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office confirmed the message is fake.   Fact Check: The U.K. is currently under a national lockdown as a measure to curb COVID-19 cases, meaning several businesses have been required to close or limit activity, according to guidance from the Cabinet Office on the U.K. government’s website. An image on Facebook purportedly shows a document from the U.K. Cabinet Office that bears the office’s logo in the upper-left corner. The document shows an “amendment to memorandum circulated to ministers 18 October 2019,” and was allegedly sent out on Nov. 3, 2019. The first positive COVID-19 test in the U.K. occurred February 2020, according to BBC News.  “Damage to the wider economy is only achievable by imposing continuing measures to prevent trading amongst the commerce and service industries as a whole regardless of the size of organization,” the text of the supposed amendment begins. The document further states that “any such disorder will be discouraged by a public health campaign that will bring on board a mixture of health information, analysis and data presented by Government and Independent institutions” and “all ministers will be complicit in the publication of the health directives.” Check Your Fact, however, didn’t find any evidence that the image shows a real message from the U.K. Cabinet Office. Major British media outlets do not appear to have reported about the Cabinet Office sending a message to ministers telling them how to ensure destruction of legally-operating businesses or economic damage. A search of the U.K. government’s website likewise turned up no results for the document or a similar message. In fact, the website offers a list of different forms of COVID-19 support available to businesses. (RELATED: Was A 19-Year-Old Appointed As Rwanda’s Minister Of New Technologies And Development?) The alleged document includes a Freedom of Information (FOI) reference number. The wording of the document, however, does not resemble other publicly available FOI response letters from the Cabinet Office, which typically begin by referencing the contents of the request. The text of the supposed document also uses the Americanized spelling of “organizations,” a term that is conventionally spelled “organisations” in the U.K., further adding to the document’s dubiousness. Cabinet Office media officer Paige Miles told Check Your Fact via email, “I can confirm that this is fake.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/cathleen.fox.39/posts/10157902570875994,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home,https://www.facebook.com/cathleen.fox.39/posts/10157902570875994,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-53907629,https://www.facebook.com/cathleen.fox.39/posts/10157902570875994,https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=cabinet+office+damage+wider+economy&page=1,https://www.thesun.co.uk/?s=cabinet+office+damage+wider+economy,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/,https://www.google.com/search?q=u.k.+cabinet+office+ensure+economy+damage&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi3r938oNHuAhWDdd8KHfYNAD0Q_AUoAXoECAgQAw&biw=1284&bih=766&dpr=2,https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=ministers+close+business&order=relevance,https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/12/fact-check-rwanda-19-patrick-nkuriza-minister-technologies-development/,https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FOI2020_06729-REPLY-1.pdf,https://www.shetnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/150626_FOI321170-REPLY.pdf,https://www.scribd.com/doc/214751941/Cabinet-Office-response,https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=organisations&order=relevance,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cf8fee9fae3feccefe4e9efe7f5e3f9feeaedeff8a2efe3e1",Does This Image Show A UK Cabinet Office Document Telling Government Ministers How To Destroy Businesses?,,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The video dates back to at least 2018, well before the COVID-19 pandemic began. The man in the video appears to be speaking Mandarin and does not resemble Thailand’s health minister. Fact Check:   The video shows a man who appears to be in emotional distress as a health care worker attempts to give him an injection. The caption and text inside the video claim the man depicted is Thailand’s minister of public health, Anutin Charnvirakul, with the caption saying in part, “#Amazing_video Health minister of Thailand getting covid19 (sic) vaccination.” A reverse image search of key frames revealed the video actually dates back to at least early 2018, when the Hong Kong-based outlet South China Morning Post (SCMP) posted the footage on its YouTube channel. The SCMP titled the YouTube video “Chinese man scared of his first ever injection.”   In the video, the people can be heard speaking Mandarin. Check Your Fact could not identify the man in the video; however, he does not closely resemble Anutin, who can be seen in photos taken by Agence France-Presse. (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Hank Aaron Was ‘Killed’ By The COVID-19 Vaccine) The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, so it is impossible for the video to be connected to the ongoing pandemic. The fact-checking website Boom Live found the inaccurate claim that the video shows Anutin receiving a COVID-19 vaccine jab had been shared on Twitter by Pakistani-Canadian writer Tarek Farah. His tweet has received over 29,400 views at the time of publication. Thailand is expected to receive thousands of doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine this month, according to Reuters. The country is also working to produce the vaccine locally for mass vaccinations in June, the outlet reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image, which dates back to 2014, has been digitally edited to remove lighting. Photos taken since Biden took office show the White House illuminated at night.   Fact Check: Biden was sworn in as the 46th president on Jan. 20. A viral image purportedly depicting all the lights off at the White House circulated online on Jan. 30 with the caption claiming that it shows the “10th night in a row” that the building had been dark and that “no body [is] home.” Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image has been edited and predates Biden’s presidency by multiple years. The unaltered image was uploaded to iStock, a stock photo website by Getty Images, in December 2015. It also appears on the stock photo website Alamy, where the description states it was taken on July 9, 2014.  In the versions available on the stock photo websites, there is a light on in a room on the upper floor, and a lantern hanging from the portico is lit. In the doctored version, lights such as the lantern and the window on the upper floor have been digitally removed, and the picture overall seems to have been darkened. Photos taken since Biden took office also show lights on at the White House in the evening. One photo taken on Jan. 30 shows exterior lights illuminating the White House, and another photo taken Jan. 23 shows what appear to be several lights on both inside and outside. Lights at the White House “go off every night around 11 p.m.,” according to a June 1, 2020, tweet from CNN Chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show All The Lights Out At The White House During George Floyd Protests)  As someone who has done many late night live shots, the lights at the White House go off every night around 11 p.m. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) June 1, 2020  This isn’t the first time the doctored photo has been used to suggest that the White House has gone dark.

Fact Check: The Facebook post, which includes a photo of Trump participating in a video call with U.S. service members, claims that the picture was “taken 2 days ago in Mar Lago.” It also says, “Patriots in control.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Donald Trump Greeting National Guard Members In DC?)

While the image does show Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, it was not taken in 2021. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact discovered the picture actually dates back to 2017. It can be found on the stock photo website Alamo, where the caption states it was taken on Christmas Eve that year. “U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to service members deployed overseas via an online video to wish them a Merry Christmas from his private resort Mar-a-Lago December 24, 2017 in Palm Beach, Florida,” the caption reads in part. On Christmas Eve in 2017, Trump spoke to members of the military stationed overseas via video hook-up, according to The Washington Post and The Associated Press. The verified Trump White House and U.S. Navy Twitter accounts tweeted the same photo on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26, 2017, respectively.  #ICYMI: The crew of #USSSampson #DDG102 received personal Christmas wishes from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump on Christmas Eve. pic.twitter.com/vRLrx96b4N — U.S. Navy (@USNavy) December 26, 2017  “#ICYMI: The crew of the #USSSampson #DDG102 received personal Christmas wishes from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump on Christmas Eve,” the U.S. Navy tweeted. Other fact-checkers have addressed erroneous claims that the U.S. military seized power. Check Your Fact previously debunked a social media post alleging Trump had invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 in a bid to stay in office.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Levine’s head has been superimposed into the image. The original photo shows a British family.   Fact Check: President Joe Biden announced on Jan. 19 that he would nominate Levine to serve as the assistant Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, CBS News reported. Levine, the Pennsylvania secretary of health at the time of her nomination, is set to potentially become the first openly transgender federal official confirmed by the Senate, according to The Washington Post. This particular Facebook post claims to show Levine holding a small dog while standing with two members of her family, with the caption attempting to disparage her gender identity and weight. Levine has been the target of derogatory social media posts in the past, The Associated Press reported.  “Biden’s new overweight transgender health secretary and her/his family,” text in the image reads. “Dr. Rachel Levine, she will be in charge of our healthy lifestyle. Congratulations America!!” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Article About Rachel Levine Vowing To Make ‘Hostile Misgendering’ A Mental Illness Under New Health Guidelines) In reality, the image has been digitally altered. The Mirror, a U.K. media outlet, published the original photo in a July 2015 article about a British family that appeared in the reality TV show “Lorraine Kelly’s Big Fat Challenge.” In the unaltered photo’s caption, the people pictured are identified as Philip Chawner and his daughters, Samantha and Emma. Levine’s face and hair has been photoshopped onto Chawner’s body in the doctored image being shared on Facebook. The faces of Chawner’s daughters have also been manipulated. This isn’t the first time Levine has been the subject of online misinformation since being nominated for the assistant HHS secretary position. Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that a syndicated Associated Press article reported that Levine said she would make “hostile misgendering” a mental illness under new health guidelines.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/marlene.waak/posts/10158928296379035,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rachel-levine-assistant-health-secretary-biden/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/19/rachel-levine-transgender-biden-hhs-pick/,https://www.facebook.com/marlene.waak/posts/10158928296379035,https://apnews.com/article/0f2961360d5679c16e9a2135b6a51714,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/22/fact-check-rachel-levin-associated-press-hostile-misgendering/,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/mum-walks-out-tv-reality-6002230,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1968638/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/22/fact-check-rachel-levin-associated-press-hostile-misgendering/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb9f998e9d8499ab88838e888092849e998d8a889fc5888486",Does This Image Show Rachel Levine With Her Family?,,,,,,

The lengthy statement has previously circulated online without being attributed to Limbaugh, and media outlets have credited similar statements to different people.   Fact Check: Limbaugh, who has previously expressed support for Trump, falsely claimed on Jan. 20 that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election “legitimately,” The Hill reported. Now, Facebook users are sharing an open letter, purportedly from Limbaugh, that thanks Trump for his four years as president. “My days on earth are numbered; But before I fade away, there is something important I need to say,” the letter begins. “It may not be important to anyone else; but it’s important to me. Win, lose, or fraud… President Trump, I just want to say thank you for the last four years.”  The open letter goes on to thank Trump for “making it cool to be an American again,” “making it feel good to love our country and to be a proud patriot again,” and “supporting our Nation’s flag and the men and women who fought for the freedom that stands behind that flag,” among other things. There is, however, no evidence the open letter originated with Limbaugh, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The statement does not appear in transcripts of Limbaugh’s radio show, on his website or in any of his Facebook posts. A review of an archived version of his Twitter timeline from the time he joined Twitter in October 2020 until January shows no similar statements. Limbaugh deactivated his Twitter account in early January after Trump was permanently suspended from the platform, USA Today reported. “These are not Rush Limbaugh’s words,” Rachel Nelson, public relations director of Premiere Networks, which syndicates Limbaugh’s radio show, confirmed to Check Your Fact via email. (RELATED: Did Jim Jordan Author This Statement About Donald Trump’s Second Impeachment?) While an internet search found no media reports about the open letter being from Limbaugh, it did show iterations of the lengthy statement have been circulating online since at least November 2020, when a Facebook user posted it without attribution. Check Your Fact also found the statement published on the websites of two media outlets, The Florida Times-Union and The Bakersfield Californian. The Florida Times-Union posted a version of the letter on Jan. 17 as a guest column and credited it to a Jacksonville resident. The Bakersfield Californian published a shorter version on Jan. 13 as a letter to the editor from a Bakersfield resident. It’s unclear how the open letter first became linked to Limbaugh.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10164704910550301&id=875710300,https://thehill.com/homenews/media/535288-limbaugh-falsely-says-biden-didnt-win-legitimately-while-reacting-to,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10164704910550301&id=875710300,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10164704910550301&id=875710300,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10164704910550301&id=875710300,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/category/transcripts/page/2/,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/?s=My%20days%20on%20earth%20are%20numbered&is_v=1,https://www.facebook.com/page/136264019722601/search?q=But%20before%20I%20fade%20away%2C%20there%20is%20something%20important%20I%20need%20to%20say&filters=eyJycF9jaHJvbm9fc29ydDowIjoie1wibmFtZVwiOlwiY2hyb25vc29ydFwiLFwiYXJnc1wiOlwiXCJ9In0%3D,https://web.archive.org/web/20201103003922/https://twitter.com/RealRLimbaugh,https://web.archive.org/web/20210107082542/https://twitter.com/RealRLimbaugh,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/08/rush-limbaugh-leaves-twitter-following-trump-ban/6605864002/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/28/fact-check-jim-jordan-statement-donald-trump-second-impeachment/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Rush+Limbaugh+%22My+days+on+earth+are+numbered.+But+before+I+fade+away,+there+is+something+important+I+need+to+say%22&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0n4iWusnuAhXzFVkFHfDKCtwQ_AUoA3oECAYQBQ&biw=1265&bih=688,https://www.facebook.com/jennie697/posts/10164679367005341,https://www.jacksonville.com/story/opinion/2021/01/17/guest-column-thank-you-president-trump/4174509001/,https://www.bakersfield.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-thank-you-for-doing-your-best/article_3b987cb8-5438-11eb-b2fc-ab82f1412f5c.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1d5d3c4d7ced3e1c2c9c4c2cad8ced4d3c7c0c2d58fc2cecc",Did Rush Limbaugh Write This Open Letter Thanking Donald Trump For The ‘Last Four Years’?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The election technology firm’s systems have never been used in Myanmar, according to a Dominion Voting Systems spokesperson. In Myanmar, voters use paper ballots that are counted by hand.   Fact Check: The Feb. 1 post features a photo of the National League for Democracy Party’s Aung San Suu Kyi with former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The text accompanying the picture attempts to link Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology firm that has been a popular target for misinformation, to Myanmar’s November 2020 election. “The White House is freaking out after Myanmar Military arrests political leaders for Election Fraud in their November 8 elections. Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems,” claims the Facebook post.  Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won 83 percent of available parliamentary seats in the November election, which the army alleged had fraud, according to the U.S. News & World Report. Myanmar’s election commission rejected the military’s fraud allegations. The military staged a coup on Feb. 1, detaining Suu Kyi and other elected officials, The Washington Post reported. Check Your Fact didn’t find any evidence in media reports that Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems in its election. A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems also confirmed the post’s claim is false. “This is a completely false claim,” the Dominion Voting Systems spokesperson told Check Your Fact via email. “Dominion systems have never been used in Myanmar at any time.” (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother-In-Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) A European Union-funded report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance outlines the voting process in Myanmar’s 2020 general election. The report, which does not mention Dominion Voting Systems, indicates that voters in Myanmar cast paper ballots and that the ballots are hand-counted. Photos of voters casting their paper ballots in Myanmar’s November 2020 election can be found on Getty Images. In a Feb. 1 statement, President Joe Biden called the military takeover in Myanmar a “direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy,” saying that “force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election” in a democracy.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor Schakohl, Elias AtienzaContributor","https://www.facebook.com/jo.gomez.520/posts/10218889441966672,https://www.facebook.com/jo.gomez.520/posts/10218889441966672,https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-photos-2012-12,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/dominion-voting-systems-sues-rudy-giuliani-over-false-election-claims-n1255511,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup.html,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-01-31/explainer-crisis-in-myanmar-after-army-alleges-election-fraud,https://apnews.com/article/aung-san-suu-kyi-elections-myanmar-cc1b225b806c27dda748d3ab51d0e47f,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/myanmar-coup-suu-kyi-military/2021/02/01/57ffbe8a-6431-11eb-bab8-707f8769d785_story.html,https://news.google.com/search?q=myanmar%20dominion%20voting%20systems&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/22/fact-check-joe-bidens-brother-in-law-own-dominion-voting-systems/,https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/news/news-pdfs/2020-General-Election-in-Myanmar-Fact-Sheet_14-July-2020.pdf?mc_cid=c605c13046&mc_eid=0295fac55f,https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/news/news-pdfs/2020-General-Election-in-Myanmar-Fact-Sheet_14-July-2020.pdf?mc_cid=c605c13046&mc_eid=0295fac55f,https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/myanmar-ballot?family=editorial&phrase=myanmar%20ballot&sort=newest#license,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/01/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-the-situation-in-burma/","No, Myanmar Did Not Use Dominion Voting Systems In Its November 2020 Election",,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no evidence that the Biden administration has lowered the age of consent or that CNN has published the pictured article. The image is doctored. Fact Check:   In recent days, social media users have been sharing an image that they claim shows a recent CNN article putting up the headline “Biden administration lowers age of consent to 8.” Text within the supposed article alleges that the Biden administration confirmed the age of consent will change starting Feb. 16 and that Biden made a comment about it during a speech. “We have to do it,” the purported article quotes Biden as saying. “The age, the kids, they should be about this old.” (RELATD: No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg Didn’t Say Pedophilia Is ‘Good For The Children’) Yet, while the pictured CNN article may appear authentic at first glance, there is no record of CNN publishing a story with that headline or quote on its website. Nor has the outlet posted the supposed article on social media. A CNN source confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that the image is fake.  The fabricated image appears to be a doctored screen grab of a real CNN article titled “Biden’s pick for UN ambassador vows to hold China accountable and expresses regret for speech at Beijing backed event.” The bylines, which list reporters Jennifer Hansler, Michael Conte and Devan Cole, and the time stamps, which say the story was updated at 3:40 p.m. ET on Jan. 27, match. In the altered image, a photo of Biden’s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations seems to have been swapped out for a picture of Biden. Check Your Fact didn’t find any national or local reporting to corroborate the claim that the Biden administration has lowered or attempted to lower the age of consent. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website says that “states’ statutory rape offenses detail the age at which an individual can legally consent to sexual activity.” The White House did not return a request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The nine observations do not appear in any of Cicero’s surviving works. Experts told Check Your Fact that the statements do not resemble Cicero’s writings or philosophies. Fact Check:    The viral image lists nine statements, supposedly written in 43 B.C. by “Cicero of the Roman empire.” Some of the statements include: “The poor – work & work,” “The rich – exploit the poor,” “The soldier – protects both” “The goons – scare all seven” and “The Politician -, lives happily on account of all eight.” One post’s caption further remarks, “Still valid even today…” While Cicero did write prolifically about politics, there is no evidence that the ancient Roman statesman wrote these observations. Check Your Fact didn’t find any of the nine statements in Cicero’s surviving works. Experts also told Check Your Fact the attribution is inaccurate. Dr. Clifford Ando, a professor of classics and history at the University of Chicago, noted in an email to Check Your Fact that it does not resemble “anything in Cicero’s philosophy.”  “That is true at the level of content, but also at the level of style,” Ando said. “By this I mean that Cicero was a very conservative political thinker, and did not voice cynicism of this flavor about rich and poor, or about lawyers (not because he was a famous courtroom lawyer); ‘doctor’ was not a notable profession in late republican Rome; ditto, bankers.” Rutgers University classics professor Dr. T. Corey Brennan told Check Your Fact via email that the quote is “simply made up.” (RELATED: Did Cicero Say This Quote About Ancient Rome?) “Most of these bullet points (#1, #2, #5, #6, #7) strike me as the opposite of Cicero’s views, and #4 and #9 strictly speaking are anachronistic (the idea that Cicero mentioned ‘the taxpayer’ as a class is a giveaway that the quote is fake … also political offices technically were unpaid, though folks obviously profited from them),” Brennan said. Boston University classics professor Dr. Ann Carol Vasaly told Check Your Fact via email: “To my knowledge, Cicero never said or wrote anything similar to what you sent me.” “Further, no one who has any knowledge of Cicero would refer to him as ‘Cicero of the Roman Empire,'” Vasaly said. “The Empire, as a designation of time period, refers to the period of Augustus and later. Cicero lived during the period of the Roman Republic.” Cicero, who died in 43 B.C., lived during the Roman Republic, which according to Encyclopedia Britannica, lasted from about 509 to 27 B.C.

Verdict: False There is no indication H&M has sold the pictured sweatshirt. In a statement to Check Your Fact, H&M Media Relations confirmed the image is “fake.”   Fact Check: The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of the H&M website showing a young boy modeling a hooded sweatshirt with the words “Koolest Kid in the Klan” printed across the front. The post suggests that the pictured sweatshirt can be purchased for $24.99 on the site. However, there is no indication H&M has actually offered the “Koolest Kid in the Klan” sweatshirt as an item for sale. No product featuring the phrase appears on H&M’s website. Check Your Fact also didn’t find any national or local media reports about the clothing retailer selling the sweatshirt.  H&M Media Relations provided Check Your Fact an emailed statement about the alleged sweatshirt, along with a link to an article about the company’s inclusion and diversity initiatives. (RELATED: Were Members Of ‘The Squad’ Pictured Wearing Clothing With Swastikas?) “This is a fake photo,” the statement from H&M reads. “We were upset and sad to see this as it goes against everything we stand for. To us, inclusion and diversity is key to the success of a global company and during the past year we have put extra focus on this.” The image of the fake “Koolest Kid in the Klan” sweatshirt appears to date back to at least January 2018, when it was posted on the website Imgur. In January 2018, H&M received criticism for a photo on its website that featured a black child wearing a sweatshirt with the phrase “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle,” according to the Washington Post. H&M later apologized for the “Coolest Monkey” photo, saying in a statement to The New York Times, “We are deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print. Therefore, we have not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering globally.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/shayna.brantley.3/posts/1036381136855665,https://www.facebook.com/shayna.brantley.3/posts/1036381136855665,https://www2.hm.com/en_us/search-results.html?q=Koolest+kid+in+the+klan,https://www.google.com/search?q=H%26M+%22Coolest+Kid+in+the+Klan%22&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01JP65Ojf9gDkLSz-eQoXleORqb-g:1612104932244&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjkrs7utsbuAhW8HDQIHeiRAgoQ_AUoAnoECAgQBA&biw=1099&bih=625,https://hmgroup.com/news/hm-group-inclusion-and-diversity-update/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/14/fact-check-squad-tlaib-omar-ocasio-cortez-clothing-swastikas/,https://imgur.com/a/k0oz2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/19/hm-faced-backlash-over-its-monkey-sweatshirt-ad-it-isnt-the-companys-only-controversy/,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/business/hm-monkey.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196d6b7c6f766b597a717c7a7260766c6b7f787a6d377a7674",Is H&M Selling A ‘Koolest Kid In The Klan’ Sweatshirt?,,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no record of Gates saying he wants to eliminate 3 billion people. The claim appears to stem from a misrepresentation of comments Gates made in a 2010 Ted Talk about climate change.   Fact Check: The Facebook post shares a video of a man who says that Gates said 3 billion people, starting in Africa, need to die. The video shows Dr. Robert O. Young, who, according to NBC San Diego, was sentenced to jail time for practicing medicine without a license, as he speaks in front of a panel for the International Tribunal for Natural Justice, a group that has promoted conspiracy theories, specifically about 5G technology, the Daily Mail reported. “There’s too many people on the planet we need to get rid of,” Young says. “In the words of Bill Gates, at least 3 billion people need to die. So we’ll just start off in Africa, we’ll start doing our research there and we’ll eliminate more of the Africans because they’re deplorable, they’re worthless, they’re not part of this world economy.” (RELATED: Have Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, The WHO And Others Been Charged With War Crimes?)  There is, however, no record of Gates saying he wants to eliminate 3 billion people. Check Your Fact searched through the Gates Foundation website and Gates’ blog, but found no evidence of him making the statement attributed to him in the video. Nor did a search of Gates’ verified social media accounts turn up any similar remarks. Check Your Fact also didn’t find any media reports corroborating the claim that Gates made the comment, only other fact-checkers debunking the claim. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to Check Your Fact’s request for comment by the time of publication, but a spokesperson for the foundation told PolitiFact that the claim was false. The claim that Gates said 3 billion people need to die appears to be a misrepresentation of comments Gates made during a 2010 TED Talk about how to mitigate the effects of climate change. A review of the transcript of his speech shows that he did not claim 3 billion people need to die. Instead, Gates stated that increasing access to health care, reproductive health services and vaccines would lower the rate of global population growth and help lower carbon emissions. “The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15%,” Gates said. In addition, Gates said in 2012 that reducing child mortality rates may help slow unsustainable population growth rates, saying, “Amazingly, as children survive, parents feel like they’ll have enough kids to support them in their old age, so they choose to have less children.” He and his wife Melinda also wrote in their 2014 annual Gates Foundation letter that there is a correlation between “child death and birth rates,” noting that “when children survive in greater numbers, parents decide to have smaller families.” “When children are well-nourished, fully vaccinated, and treated for common illnesses like diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia, the future gets a lot more predictable,” the letter reads in part. “Parents start making decisions based on the reasonable expectation that their children will live.” In the letter, he and his wife state, “We make the future sustainable when we invest in the poor, not when we insist on their suffering.” At no point in the annual letter do they advocate for 3 billion deaths.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A CNN spokesperson confirmed the image is fake.   Fact Check: In recent days, amateur investors from the Reddit group “WallStreetBets” have fueled a surge in the value of video game retailer GameStop’s stock, which had been shorted by hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, according to NBC News. The Facebook image claims to show a CNN Business headline related to the GameStop stock fluctuation that was allegedly written by “Moshie R. Horowitz” and updated on Jan. 27, the date International Holocaust Remembrance Day is held. The image has also circulated on Twitter and Reddit, where some users expressed doubt about its authenticity and others appeared to believe it was genuine.  There is no record of CNN publishing the supposed headline on its website. Searching social media posts from CNN and CNN Business turned up no matches for the article. Check Your Fact also didn’t find any CNN articles with bylines listing “Moshie R. Horowitz” as the author. “Everything about this is fake,” Bridget Leininger, a senior director of communications at CNN, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi Own Stock In Dominion Voting Systems?) The fabricated CNN Business article surfaced amid amateur investors driving up GameStop’s stock price, causing hedge funds and other groups that attempted to short the stock to lose money. Short selling occurs when investors borrow shares of a stock they expect will fall to sell and later buy back to return to the lender, according to NPR. Short sellers essentially bet that the stock price will continue to fall between when they sell the stock and when they buy it back to return to the lender, according to The Associated Press. If the stock price does fall between those two transactions, the investor keeps the profit. If the price goes up, the investor loses money when they buy back the stock to return it to the lender. GameStop’s dramatic stock price increase has forced short sellers who bet its price would fall to buy back the stock to prevent further losses, making the price rise even higher, The Associated Press reported. This phenomenon is known as a short squeeze. Bloomberg reported that Melvin Capital, thought to be one of the hardest-hit by the GameStop short squeeze, had lost 30 percent of its financial assets in the first few weeks of January. Melvin Capital has closed out its short position on GameStop and recently received an infusion of about $2.75 billion from the hedge funds Citadel and Point72 Asset Management, according to CNBC.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/itaintaboutu/posts/10164735754700335,https://melvincapital.com/,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922,https://www.facebook.com/itaintaboutu/posts/10164735754700335,https://www.ushmm.org/remember/international-holocaust-remembrance-day,https://twitter.com/drbitcoinmd/status/1354727934486052865,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6gfn1/stop_persecuting_the_jews_with_your_stock_buying/,https://www.cnn.com/search?size=10&q=%22white%20supremacist%20internet%20gamers%22,https://www.facebook.com/page/5550296508/search/?q=white%20supremacist%20internet%20gamers%20buy%20gamestop,https://www.facebook.com/page/6651543066/search/?q=White%20Supremacist%20internet%20Gamers%20buy%20Gamestop%20stocks%20to%20purposefully%20bankrupt%20Jewish%20Hedge%20Fund%20on%20International%20Holocaust%20Remembrance%20Day,https://twitter.com/search?q=white%20supremacist%20internet%20gamers%20(from%3ACNN%20OR%20from%3ACNNBusiness)&src=typed_queryhttps://twitter.com/search?q=white%20supremacist%20internet%20gamers%20(from%3ACNN%20OR%20from%3ACNNBusiness)&src=typed_query,https://www.cnn.com/search?size=10&q=Moshie%20R.%20Horowitz,https://twitter.com/bleiningercnn?lang=en,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/24/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-own-stock-dominion-voting-systems/,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/28/961349400/gamestop-how-reddit-traders-occupied-wall-streets-turf,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/28/961619848/so-what-is-short-selling-an-explainer,https://apnews.com/article/gamestop-stock-surge-explained-fb377363d1b04809706619a6bcc9e549,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp,https://apnews.com/article/gamestop-stock-surge-explained-fb377363d1b04809706619a6bcc9e549,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp?utm_source=news-to-use&utm_campaign=sailthru_signup_page&utm_term=22770676&utm_medium=email,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/citadel-point72-to-invest-275-billion-in-melvin-capital,https://www.citadel.com/,https://www.point72.com/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afdbddcad9c0ddefccc7caccc4d6c0daddc9ceccdb81ccc0c2",Does This Image Show A Real CNN Headline Related To GameStop’s Stock Price Increase?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Images and videos show that the executive orders did indeed have text on them.   Fact Check:  Biden has signed more than 30 executive actions in his first week of office, with over a dozen of them signed on his first day, according to ABC News. Since Inauguration Day, social media users have shared posts claiming that Biden signed “Blank Papers” instead of actual executive orders, with some versions showing a photo of him wearing a purple tie and signing what looks like blank paper. While the bright lighting in some photos and videos makes it appear that the pages are blank, other photos and videos of Biden signing executive orders clearly show that there is text on the documents. A Jan. 21 video posted on YouTube by CNBC clearly shows text on the executive order Biden is signing at around the 40-second mark. In the video, Biden can be seen wearing the same purple tie that he is wearing in the Facebook posts that claim the pages were blank.   In a video taken by The Washington Post on Jan. 20, text can also be seen on the first executive order as Biden opens it. An image published by The New York Times likewise shows text on the executive order Biden is seen signing. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Sign An Executive Order To Tear Down The US-Mexico Border Wall?) Every executive order Biden has signed since taking office is available to read on the White House website. Furthermore, the executive orders are being added to the Federal Register website, though there appears to be a slight delay between the date they were signed and the day they are published are on the website. Check Your Fact was unable to find any news reporting to corroborate the claim that Biden signed blank documents, only other fact-checking websites debunking the claim. AFP Fact Check increased the contrast on video and images taken by AFP to show the text more clearly.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no indication Aaron’s death was caused by his COVID-19 vaccination. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office, which examined his body, has said that he died of natural causes.   Fact Check: Aaron, a Baseball Hall of Fame member, passed away Jan. 22 at the age of 86. He is remembered by many as the baseball legend who, among other accomplishments, eclipsed Babe Ruth’s long-standing home run record in 1974, according to ESPN. Following his death, Facebook users started sharing a collage of news headlines about him along with claims that he was “killed” by a COVID-19 vaccine. Aaron had received Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks prior, according to a post on his verified Twitter account.   I was proud to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier today at Morehouse School of Medicine. I hope you do the same! https://t.co/RAlkmkCRra — Hank Aaron (@HenryLouisAaron) January 5, 2021  “I was proud to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier today at Morehouse School of Medicine,” he tweeted. “I hope you do the same!” But, contrary to the claims in Facebook posts, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine “killed” Aaron. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office in Georgia told the news outlet 11 Alive that Aaron’s cause of death was natural and that there is no indication the vaccine contributed to his death. The Braves, his long-time team, also said in a statement that he died “peacefully in his sleep.” Morehouse School of Medicine, where Aaron received the COVID-19 vaccination on Jan. 5, released a statement to the news outlet CBS 42 that reads in part, “His passing was not related to the vaccine, nor did he experience any side effects from the immunization.” (RELATED: Viral Post Falsely Claims The First UK COVID-19 Vaccine Recipient Is A Crisis Actor) Medical experts such as Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at the Emory University School of Medicine, also pushed back on the notion that Aaron’s death was connected to his vaccination. Del Rio told NBC News that he has “absolute confidence that his death has nothing to do with the vaccine and it has to do with the fact that he was old and frail.” Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 18. The FDA said in a Dec. 17 briefing document that it found “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA.” The vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing COVID-19 in people who “received two doses who had no evidence of being previously infected,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC reports that over 26 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered as of Jan. 28.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Jim Jordan about former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment.  Verdict: False Jordan did not write the statement, according to a spokesperson from his office. The statement has been circulating online since at least December 2020, a month before Trump’s second impeachment.   Fact Check: Trump was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives on one count of inciting an insurrection following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to The New York Times. Jordan has been outspoken about his opposition to Trump’s second impeachment, saying, it was “about canceling the president and canceling all the people you guys disagree with,” NBC News reported. This particular Facebook post claims Jordan shared his feelings about the impeachment in a long statement, reading in part, “I tolerated 44 (Obama) for 8 years and although I didn’t vote for him, I only hoped the best for him, never said ‘ Not my President ‘ because he certainly was the President of the United States.” It goes on to list things the author remembers such as “the Presidents spokesperson being kicked out a restaurant,” “five Senators shot on a ballfield” and “people banging on the Supreme Court door.”  There is, however, no evidence that Jordan made the lengthy statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. Media outlets haven’t reported about Jordan making the statement. Check Your Fact also did not find the lengthy statement on Jordan’s verified Twitter and Facebook accounts. Nor does the comment appear in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. Resources like Jordan’s congressional website and the congressional record likewise turned up no matching remarks. A spokesperson from Jordan’s office confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the Republican congressman had not made the statement. (RELATED: ‘If A Few Senior Citizens Die, I Can Live With That’ – Did Rep. Jim Jordan Make This Comment About Coronavirus On Fox News?) The lengthy statement has been circulating online since at least December 2020, when one Facebook user shared a version attributed to “a real American.” It’s unclear how the statement was first erroneously credited to Jordan. Jordan and other conservative lawmakers are looking to establish a rapid-response squad to “advise Trump’s legal team and speak to the media,” according to Bloomberg News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Jill Biden was in her 20s when they started dating, according to media reports and the couple’s account of their relationship. There is no indication they met when Jill Biden was a teenager.   Fact Check: The meme includes an old photo of Joe and Jill Biden that the first lady tweeted on Aug. 18, 2020. Text inside the meme reads in part, “‘Dr. Jill’ was the Biden’s teenage baby sitter when Pedo Joe began having sex with her while his wife was in the hospital.” Joe Biden’s first wife, Neilia, and their 13-month-old daughter Naomi died in December 1972 in a car crash that also injured their two sons, NBC News reported. State police said Neilia and Naomi Biden were pronounced dead at the hospital after the crash, according to a Delaware County Daily Times article archived on Newspapers.com.  Joe Biden and Jill Biden started dating in 1975, according to The New York Times and the White House website. She and her first husband, Bill Stevenson, finalized their divorce during the same year. Jill Biden, who was born in 1951, and Joe Biden, who was born in 1942, were respectively in their 20s and 30s when they started dating. In 2016, Jill Biden told Vogue that the pair’s first date took place during her senior year of college, which, according to the University of Delaware website, was in 1975. She also said in a 2012 CNN interview with Piers Morgan that she had met Joe Biden once before the date while at a fundraiser. They married in 1977. Stevenson, her first husband, has claimed that he had introduced Jill Biden to Joe Biden in 1972 and that her relationship with Joe Biden started in 1974. Jill Biden’s spokesperson denied his allegations in a statement to Inside Edition. (RELATED: Did Jill Biden Say, ‘All Americans Will Be Required To Learn Spanish When We Win’?) “The relationship of Joe and Jill Biden is well documented,” the spokesperson said in a statement to Inside Edition in September 2020. “Jill Biden separated from her first husband irreconcilably in the fall of 1974 and moved out of their marital home. Joe and Jill Biden had their first date in March of 1975, and they married in June of 1977.” There is no indication that Jill and Joe Biden met when she was a teenager.

Verdict: False The footage does not show Navy ships, according to a spokesperson for the Port of Los Angeles and the executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California. It actually shows cargo and cruise ships anchored near California’s San Pedro Bay port complex.   Fact Check: The short video shows multiple large ships off the coast of what appears to be a highway. In the background, a woman can be heard saying that the location of the scene is near Long Beach in Southern California. Some Facebook users shared the video alongside captions suggesting it shows military ships, with one Jan. 19 post saying, “BREAKING – Massive deployment of U.S. Navy ships off the coast of the U.S. for unknown reasons.”  The video does not show U.S. Navy ships, according to a spokesperson for the Port of Los Angeles and the executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California. The Marine Exchange of Southern California is a nonprofit organization that “operates the Vessel Traffic Service for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,” according to its Facebook page. “The video circulating online shows cargo and cruise ships waiting at anchor outside the San Pedro Bay port complex, which includes both the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach,” Rachel Campbell, media relations manager for the Port of Los Angeles, told Check Your Fact via email. “They are not military vessels.” Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California and Vessel Traffic Service Los Angeles and Long Beach, also confirmed in an email that “they’re not Navy ships or tankers.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say Soldiers Overseas Should Not Be Able To Vote Because ‘They Don’t Even Live Here’?) “This time they are mostly container ships carrying everything that everyone has ordered since they are staying home… home gym equipment, home office furniture, home improvement supplies and paint,” Louttit told Check Your Fact. “That plus all the usual stuff people order that is manufactured overseas.” A Facebook user posted the same video on Jan. 18, claiming she had filmed it two day earlier. The Long Beach Post reported in mid-January that dozens of container ships were anchored off the coast of Long Beach while waiting to dock, including about 30 ships on Jan. 15. The Los Angeles and Long Beach ports have been experiencing a backlog, according to the Los Angeles Times. “Demand [is] up,” Louttit explained to Check Your Fact. “Conversely, the ports and its workers are less efficient than they should be due to COVID-19 protocols.

Fact Check:   Harris, who was sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20, is a popular target for misinformation online. This particular Facebook post attempts to attribute a quote regarding Trump supporters to the vice president. The supposed quote has also been shared on Instagram. “These Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, it’s time to end this,” she allegedly said. “They really don’t get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, I’ll take the reigns (sic). They will beg me for a loaf of bread.” Check Your Fact didn’t find any record of Harris making the statement attributed to her the viral posts. It does not appear in any of her social media posts or in press releases on White House website. National and local media outlets have not credited her as saying the quote either.  The posts claim Harris made the alleged statement on Jan. 21. However, there are no speeches or remarks from the vice president posted on the White House website for that date. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Sign An Executive Order To Tear Down The US-Mexico Border Wall?) She delivered her first official speech as vice president on Jan. 20, Time Magazine reported. In her speech during the inaugural celebration concert, Harris did not mention Trump or his supporters, the White House transcript and PBS NewsHour footage show. “It is my honor to be here. To stand on the shoulders of those who came before. To speak tonight as your Vice President,” Harris said in part. “In many ways, this moment embodies our character as a nation. It demonstrates who we are. Even in dark times – we not only dream. We do.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/365302020189903/posts/3668245973228808,https://www.facebook.com/365302020189903/posts/3668245973228808,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKc-7iQA3SQ/,https://twitter.com/search?q=Trumpers%20(from%3AVP%20OR%20from%3AKamalaHarris)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/24413227922/search?q=Trumpers,https://www.facebook.com/page/102479025168087/search/?q=Trumpers,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/,https://www.google.com/search?ei=NH0QYKLEJuGy5NoPsoSpmAE&q=Kamala+Harris+%22These+Trumpers%2C+think+we+care+about+the+constitution%22&oq=Kamala+Harris+%22These+Trumpers%2C+think+we+care+about+the+constitution%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1CgHFjmNGDONmgBcAJ4AIABUYgB1weSAQIxNJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiirvHTubruAhVhGVkFHTJCChMQ4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/25/fact-check-joe-biden-executive-order-tear-down-border-wall/,https://time.com/5931955/kamala-harris-vice-president-inauguration-speech/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/01/20/remarks-by-vice-president-kamala-harris-at-the-celebration-of-america/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJyV-1VwqpE&feature=emb_title,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/01/20/remarks-by-vice-president-kamala-harris-at-the-celebration-of-america/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#780c0a1d0e170a381b101d1b1301170d0a1e191b0c561b1715",‘They Will Beg Me For A Loaf Of Bread’ – Did Kamala Harris Make This Statement About Trump Supporters?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The image shows Korean-American Secret Service agent David Cho, not a “Chinese handler.”   Fact Check:  The Facebook post shows a man in a face mask standing behind Biden and alleges that man is a “Chinese ‘handler'” that “has been following Biden around all day.” In the image, the square-shaped pin on the man’s lapel has been circled. “This Chinese ‘handler’ has been following Biden around all day. Literally right next to him everywhere he goes,” the post reads in part. “If that wasn’t bad enough he actually has the brazen balls to wear his Chinese Communist Party pin openly on his lapel for all to see. This cannot stand.”  While Check Your Fact could not determine the exact source of the photo, it appears to have been taken at Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20. An Associated Press photo taken on Inauguration Day identifies the man as Cho, a U.S. Secret Service agent. CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio and Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig also identified the man pictured near Biden as Cho on Twitter.  David Cho. Highly respected in the agency. Perfectionist. Got an award for negotiating security with N Korean officials. @SecretService‘s new Special Agent in Charge of President Biden’s detail. https://t.co/ySuQhGZH1C https://t.co/gB7cPxqJBD — Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) January 20, 2021  The Washington Post reported in late December that the Secret Service planned to select Cho to lead Biden’s security detail. Cho, who is Korean-American, previously served under former President Donald Trump and worked as second-in-command of the protective detail, according to NBC News. In 2019, Cho was awarded the Exceptional Service Gold Medal for “participation in high-level negotiations with the leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, planning all security details for both Presidential visits to that country, while still leading the men and women of the Presidential Protective Division’s White House Section in their zero-fail mission on the White House Complex,” according to the Department of Homeland Security website. The Facebook post’s claim that Cho was wearing Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel at the inauguration doesn’t hold up either. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Joe Biden Wearing His Walking Boot On The Wrong Foot) Photos tweeted out by the verified Secret Service Twitter account indicate other Secret Service agents wore the pins during the inauguration.

A Fox News spokesperson confirmed the pictured article is fabricated.   Fact Check:  The Jan. 25 Facebook post appears to show a screen grabbed article from Fox News that put up the headline, “Biden admin to confiscate farm equipment, ‘hoarded food’ under new agriculture licensing policies.” The supposed sub-headline reads, “The future of agriculture is a top concern.” There is no record of Fox News publishing an article about the Biden administration planning to confiscate farm equipment or hoarded food. A search of the Fox News website and the Fox Business website yielded no matches for the pictured article. A wider internet search likewise did not turn up any Fox News articles about the Biden administration planning to do such a thing.  Additionally, a Fox News spokesperson confirmed to Check Your Fact via phone that the image is not real. The image seems to be a doctored screen grab of a Jan. 20 Fox News article, titled “Biden names interim agency heads amid delay in Cabinet confirmations,” that was written by reporter Thomas Barrabi. Barrabi’s article makes no mention of the Biden administration planning to confiscate farm equipment or food. Its real sub-headline reads, “Biden had little choice but to name interim agency leaders due to delays in the confirmation process.” In the altered image, the both headline and sub-headline have been changed. Check Your Fact didn’t find any media reports corroborating the fabricated screen grab’s claim that the Biden administration is set to confiscate farming equipment or “hoarded food” under new agricultural licensing policies. President Joe Biden’s campaign website does not mention such policies either. According to his “Plan for Rural America,” Biden plans to “provide opportunities to new farmers and ranchers, including returning veterans and minorities, to enter the economy” and make it “easier to pass farms and ranches onto the next generation.” It also proposes “helping farmers leverage new technologies, techniques, and equipment to increase productivity and profit.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The language in it alludes to the debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory.   Fact Check: The image shows what appears to be a January 2011 email, purportedly from Clinton to Obama, that reads in part, “Dear Barack, When we began the pizza arrangement I thought we were going to be more careful than this. Operating from the whitehouse (sic) is not what I originally had in mind. Remember that the hotdogs can come but if you make a spectacle out of it, that will be our downfall.” The alleged email lists former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, former White House chief of staff John Podesta, actor Ben Affleck and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as additional recipients of the message. The WikiLeaks logo is visible above the purported email, seemingly suggesting it can be found on the WikiLeaks website among its leaked emails related to Clinton.  But, contrary to what the post seems to suggest, the email cannot be found in the WikiLeaks archive of emails related to Clinton. There is also no reporting from major media outlets about Clinton sending the email. It appears to have been fabricated to perpetuate unfounded conspiracy theories. (RELATED: Image Falsely Claims The Clinton Foundation Used A Ship To Traffic Children) Text in the image reads, “This is what Seth Rich died for. This was what started pizzagate.” Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, was killed in what police believe to be a failed robbery attempt in Washington, D.C., in 2016, according to CNN. Conspiracy theories baselessly attempt to link Rich’s murder to DNC emails leaked to WikiLeaks. “Pizzagate” refers to the debunked conspiracy theory that Clinton and other prominent Democrats operated a child sex trafficking ring out of a D.C. pizza joint. Some proponents of the theory suggest words like “pizza” and “hotdog” are code words for female and male children, USA Today reported. Check Your Fact previously debunked the viral claim that Clinton said in a 2016 email to then-Acting Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile, “If that f**kin bastard wins, we’re all going to hang from nooses!

Verdict: False The image appears to be a doctored screen grab of a Defense News article. There is no evidence Austin has said he is considering “defunding, maybe dismantling” the Army.   Fact Check: The Senate confirmed Austin, a four-star Army general, as Secretary of Defense on Friday in a 93-2 vote that made him the nation’s first black defense secretary, according to the Military Times. Some of his first actions included ordering a review of military sexual assault prevention programs and supporting President Joe Biden’s repeal of the transgender military ban. In the days since his confirmation, some social media users have shared a screen grab of an alleged article about Austin. The screen grabbed article, purportedly written by Defense News’ Joe Gould, puts up the headline “Lloyd Austin, Biden’s nominee to lead Pentagon, is considering ‘defunding, maybe disbanding’ U.S. Army.”  “Retired Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III vowed Tuesday to eradicate extremism in the ranks as one of his first goals if confirmed as the next defense secretary, as well as possibly defunding and maybe even disbanding the U.S. Army,” reads the first line of the supposed article. It goes on to quote Lloyd as saying, “We are looking into having China to rely on regarding national defense.” There is no evidence that Austin said he intends to defund or disband the Army. Had he made such statements, media outlets would have almost assuredly reported on it, yet none have. A reverse image search found the screen grab posted on the meme-sharing website iFunny. It appears that the image is a doctored screen grab of a Jan. 19 article published by Gould on Defense News. The Defense News article has the same byline, featured image and format as the screen grab, but the text in the body of the Defense News article, as well as the headline, do not match. For instance, the headline of the article actually reads, “House committee nixes Lloyd Austin’s waiver hearing.” Gould said in a Jan. 25 editorial that the screen grab is fabricated and that he did not report the information it conveys. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Military Band Outside The White House Playing ‘Hit The Road Jack’?) “The attached jpeg resembled a Defense News story complete with my byline, but instead of my work, it was a cocktail of lies and paranoia,” Gould wrote in part. “There was the layout of one of my stories about the new defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, but some of the words matched a Washington Post article ― and it included both a false headline about Austin ‘defunding and dismantling’ the U.S. Army and an equally false quote about America looking to China for its national defense.” As Gould noted, the fabricated image does appear to lift some language from the headline and body of a Washington Post article titled “Lloyd Austin, Biden’s nominee to lead Pentagon, vows to take on extremism in the military.” The Washington Post article did not suggest at any point that Austin is considering disbanding or defunding the Army, nor did it attribute to Austin a quote about the U.S. relying on China “regarding national defense.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Biden did sign an executive order regarding the U.S.-Mexico border wall, but it did not order that the barrier be torn down. The executive order halted construction and terminated a national emergency declaration.   Fact Check:  Biden signed numerous executive orders and other presidential actions on his first day of office, according to The New York Times. Since then, some social media users have shared a post claiming that one of the executive orders included tearing down the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a major part of former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign platform. While Biden did sign an executive order related to the border wall on Jan. 20, the order does not mandate that it be torn down. Instead, it terminates the national emergency declaration used by former President Donald Trump to divert funds toward its construction and directs workers to halt construction within a certain time period. The executive order does not mention tearing down the wall at any point.  “It shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall,” the order reads in part. “I am also directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to construct a southern border wall.” In early December, the Washington Post reported that the Biden administration was planning to halt construction of the wall. Around 450 miles of Trump’s border wall were built or reconstructed before he left office, according to Bloomberg CityLab. Ali Mayorkas, Biden’s nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, said during his Jan. 19 Senate confirmation hearing that the Biden administration has not decided what to do with the sections of the border wall that have already been constructed.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The altered image is a composite of two separate pictures. It originated from a 2017 satirical article published by Waterford Whispers News. Fact Check:    Amid Biden being sworn in as the 46th president and former President Donald Trump leaving the White House, the image circulated on both Facebook and Twitter. Some users shared the image with captions suggesting it shows two people fumigating the Oval Office ahead of Biden’s arrival. While the federal government did clean the White House before Biden moved in, the image does not depict part of that process taking place. A reverse image search revealed the doctored image originated in a May 2017 article published by the satirical newspaper Waterford Whispers News. The image appears to have been created by superimposing a photo of government employees fumigating for mosquitoes in Argentina over a photo of an Oval Office replica at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas. The picture of the mosquito fumigation can be found on the stock photo website Alamy, while the Oval Office replica photo can be found on Shutterstock. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Joe Biden And Others Violating COVID-19 Guidelines At His Birthday Party Last Week?)  The White House always undergoes a thorough cleaning between presidents. ABC News reported that government contracts show that over $200,000 has been spent on additional cleaning services for the

A version of the image was originally tweeted by The Daily Show for satirical purposes.   Fact Check: The Facebook post, which was shared just hours after President Joe Biden took the presidential oath of office, seemingly shows a moment from a Fox News broadcast featuring host Sean Hannity. The bottom of the screen shows a chyron reading, “Joe Biden Has Been President For Nine Hours And 400,000 Americans Are Dead.” The chyron seems to be in reference to the over 400,000 Americans that have died from COVID-19. There is no record of Fox News airing the purported chyron. The graphic does not appear in the video clip editing service Grabien’s database of Fox News coverage. Additionally, a Fox News spokesperson confirmed to Check Your Fact that the chyron was not authentic. (RELATED: ‘You Know I Won’ – Does This Image Show The Letter Donald Trump Left Joe Biden?)  The Daily Show, hosted by Trevor Noah on Comedy Central, tweeted the image on Jan. 20 with its logo in the upper-right corner, indicating the image was created for the show, likely as a joke.

Verdict: False The photo was taken in 2016, several years before the COVID-19 pandemic started.   Fact Check:  Featured in the photo is Biden and his wife, Jill, along with Clinton and members of her family. No one in the picture wears a face mask. The Facebook post’s caption seemingly suggests that it was taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, “Everyone in masks for the cameras – nobody in masks for the private celebrations. All you need to know.” In a Jan. 20 tweet congratulating Biden on his inauguration, Clinton shared the photo of her, her family and Biden, which may have led some social media users to erroneously believe it was taken recently. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image actually dates back to 2016, years before the COVID-19 pandemic began.  The picture can be found on the Flickr account of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, Hillary for America. According to its caption, the photo was taken in Philadelphia on July 27, 2016, the date that the third night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) was held that year. Clinton can be seen wearing the same blue jacket in an Associated Press photo taken that night at the 2016 DNC. On Jan. 20, Biden signed an executive order mandating that face masks be worn on federal property, the Wall Street Journal reported. He and some of his family members were seen without face masks during the “Celebrating America” concert at the Lincoln Memorial after his inauguration, according to The New York Times. When asked by a reporter about Biden being photographed not wearing a face mask on federal property, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki explained at a press briefing, “He was celebrating an evening of a historic day in our country.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Joe Biden In D.C. ‘Last Night’ Without A Mask?) “And certainly he signed the mask mandate because it’s a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks, how it can save tens of thousands of lives,” she said, according to the White House transcript. “We take a number of COVID precautions, as you know here, in terms of testing, social distancing, mask wearing ourselves, as we do every single day.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

(@SaycheeseDGTL) January 19, 2021  Verdict: False Maldonado-Passage was not pardoned by Trump, according to the Department of Justice website and Trump’s final pardon list.   Fact Check: Maldonado-Passage starred in the popular Netflix docuseries “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” that came out in March 2020. He was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison after being convicted for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and for violating federal wildlife laws, according to CNN. Ahead of Inauguration day, a rumor started spreading that Maldonado-Passage was one of the people who were recently pardoned by Trump. One tweet, which featured a photo of the “Tiger King” and a video clip of a limousine, claimed, “Joe Exotic’s team thanks Donald Trump for his pardoned signature & will be released from jail in Ft Worth, TX.” Similar claims have also circulated on Facebook.  Check Your Fact found no record of Maldonado-Passage being pardoned, despite him having filed a pardon application in September and his team renting a limousine. His clemency case status shows up as “pending” on the Department of Justice website, meaning a “clemency casefile has been created and the case is in one of various stages of review.” On Wednesday morning, Trump pardoned over 70 people and commuted the sentences of 70 others, according to USA Today. Maldonado-Passage’s name is not among those in the list of clemency grants put out by the White House that morning. Eric Love, a member of Maldonado-Passage’s team, later released a statement about the “Tiger King” not receiving a pardon, according to the Washington Post. “140 million Joe Exotic fans had a hard time getting out of bed this morning,” the statement read in part, the Washington Post reported. “We are disappointed that The President did not sign Joe’s Pardon, as we were confident yesterday that he would.” (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Has ‘Decided To Pardon Joe Exotic’?) The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) website lists Maldonado-Passage as currently being housed at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas. His release date is set for July 30, 2037, according to the FBOP website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Photos show Harris was sworn in as vice president using two Bibles stacked on top of each other.   Fact Check: Harris was sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Jan. 20, C-SPAN footage of the inauguration ceremony shows. President Joe Biden was sworn in shortly thereafter by Chief Justice John Roberts, as seen in CNBC’s YouTube livestream. Since the inauguration, social media users have shared a photo of Harris taking her oath of office with her hand resting on two stacked objects. Text above the photo attempts to suggest she placed her hand on a black clutch bag, saying, “Paying attention? Satanist dont (sic) touch the Holy Bible, thats why she put her clutch bag on top of the bible. These people are sick. Right in our faces.”  In reality, Harris used two Bibles for her oath of office. Photos taken from different angles for Reuters, AFP and The Associated Press show the black object is indeed a Bible being held by her husband, Doug Emhoff. It is stacked on top of another bible, the photos also indicate. (RELATED: Image Claims Barnes & Noble Will Stop Selling Bibles) One of the Bibles that Harris used for her inauguration belonged to the late Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice, NPR reported. The other Bible was previously owned by Regina Shelton, a woman whom Harris has said helped raise her and her sister, Newsweek reported. Harris used Shelton’s Bible to be sworn in as a senator and as California’s attorney general, according to ABC News. The Bible on the top in the inauguration photos either has a zipper or was being kept inside a zippered case. That appears to have led to the confusion on social media about what Harris placed her hand on while taking her oath of office Wednesday. The Associated Press reported in August that Harris attended services at the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco. Check Your Fact previously debunked a false rumor that the vice president referred to American churches as “propaganda centers.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1130501410743757&id=100013517265787,https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4939577/kamala-harris-sworn-vice-president,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39vj3oALMDM,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1130501410743757&id=100013517265787,https://pictures.reuters.com/CS.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&VBID=2C0BXZSVB74BR4&SMLS=1&RW=1194&RH=689&POPUPPN=8&POPUPIID=2C0BF1M959X52,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/kamala-harris-flanked-by-her-husband-doug-emhoff-is-sworn-news-photo/1230698912?adppopup=true,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/APTOPIX-Biden-Inauguration/8b4cab865f584234bba4021c8426cd8f/3/0,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/15/fact-check-image-barnes-noble-stop-selling-bibles/,https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958749751/vice-president-kamala-harris-takes-the-oath-of-office,https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-sworn-using-thurgood-marshall-bible-honor-personal-hero-1563115,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-sworn-justice-sonia-sotomayor-inauguration/story?id=75296716,https://apnews.com/article/baptist-kamala-harris-joe-biden-f2a91e545f44712a7ea7bd962412bcfe,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/13/fact-check-kamala-harris-american-churches-propaganda-centers/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f1f7e0f3eaf7c5e6ede0e6eefceaf0f7e3e4e6f1abe6eae8",Did Kamala Harris Place Her Hand On A Purse While Taking Her Oath Of Office?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The footage was first posted on TikTok on Jan. 7. License plates visible in an April 2020 video that the TikTok user appears to have taken at the same event indicates it was not filmed in the U.S.   Fact Check: Over 25,000 National Guardsmen were deployed to D.C. to help bolster security for Biden’s inauguration following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, NBC 4 Washington reported. Other security measures were put in place in the city, including shutting down several roads, after the FBI warned of threats, according to the outlet. The Jan. 15 Facebook post shares a video showing several helicopters flying above a road followed by additional rotored aircraft. “I’m going to go out on a limb and say this is a little bit of overkill preparing for some people who broke windows last week,” the caption of the video reads, seemingly referencing the extra security precautions put in place for Biden’s inauguration.  The video, however, does not show a scene in D.C. on Jan. 15. The footage was actually first posted by a TikTok user with the username @jaymb1719 on Jan. 7. In the comments section of the video, the user stated that the footage is two years old and shows a 2018 airshow in Denmark. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims The Marine Corps Refused Nancy Pelosi’s Request For Troops For Inauguration Security) The TikTok user @jaymb1719 also previously posted a video on TikTok in April 2020 that appears to have been filmed at the same location as the video in the Facebook post. The helicopters, as well as a bus parked in the same position, can be seen in the April 2020 video. In that video, a car with a European-style license plate can be seen pulling out onto the road, indicating the footage was taken outside the U.S. Due to the low video quality, Check Your Fact could not definitively discern which specific country the license plate comes from.

Verdict: False The image appears to be a doctored version of a syndicated article published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) news website. There is no record of CBC News or The Associated Press publishing an article about Levine vowing to classify “hostile misgendering” as a mental illness.   Fact Check: President Joe Biden tapped Levine to become the assistant Health and Human Services secretary on Jan. 19, according to The Washington Post. She is poised to potentially become to first openly transgender federal official confirmed by the Senate, the outlet reported. Following Biden’s announcement, Facebook users started sharing an alleged screen grab of a syndicated Associated Press article that puts up the headline “Biden’s pick for Assistant Secretary of Health vows to make ‘hostile misgendering’ a mental illness under administration’s new health guidelines.” The supposed article, time stamped to Jan. 19 at 8:18 a.m. ET, appears to match the style of stories on the CBC News website.  There is no record of the Associated Press or the CBC publishing the pictured article. A search of the outlets’ respective websites yielded no stories about Levine making the vow about “hostile misgendering.” Major media outlets likely would have reported on the remark if Levine had made it, yet none appear to have done so. The image seems to be a doctored screen grab of an actual syndicated Associated Press article published on CBC News website. CBC News published the article with the headline “Biden picks transgender Pennsylvania official for Senate-confirmed health role” on the same date and at the same time as the image being shared. The sub-headline reads, “Rachel Levine is being appointed to serve as assistant secretary of health.” Archived versions of the CBC News article from Jan. 19 and 20 show the headline and sub-headline as staying the same. The origin of the altered screen grab appears to be 4chan. Check Your Fact has previously debunked doctored screen grabs of news articles that originated on the internet messaging forum. (RELATED: Did Trey Gowdy Defend The Transgender Military Ban In An Interview CNN?) “We can confirm that CBC News has never run such a headline or story,” Katherine Wolfgang, director of communications for CBC, said in an email to Check Your Fact. Patrick Maks, media relations manager for The Associated Press, also told Check Your Fact via email: “AP did not run a story saying that Levine would have hostile misgendering labeled as a mental illness.” Levine released a statement about her nomination to the assistant Health and Human Services secretary position on Jan. 19. While she did say that she is proud of the “work I have done personally to raise awareness about LGBTQ equity issues,” she does not use the phrase “hostile misgendering” at any point in the statement. It focuses on the various work she has done as Pennsylvania’s health secretary under Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. “Our work on addressing the opioid epidemic has saved lives and developed innovative models to get people into treatment and into recovery. I am proud of the work we have done to fight diseases such as HIV and Hep C, as well as preventing diseases through our childhood immunization programs,” reads her statement in part. “I am proud of the work we have done as an administration to address health equity, and the work I have done personally to raise awareness about LGBTQ equity issues.” “I look forward to the opportunity to continue to serve Pennsylvanians, and all Americans, as part of the Biden Administration if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed to this position,” Levin also said in the statement.

The pictured letter appears to have been fabricated.   Fact Check: It is a modern tradition for the outgoing president to leave a note on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office for the incoming president, according to CNN. On Wednesday, Trump left Biden a letter, which Biden has described as “very generous,” though he did not disclose its contents, the outlet reported. Some social media users have been sharing an alleged image of the letter, reading, “Joe, you know I won.” The message seemingly references Trump’s baseless claims that mass voter fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Invoke The Insurrection Act?)  While the letter appears to contain Trump’s signature and official letterhead, other aspects suggest it is inauthentic. The seal at the top of the note does not match the golden seal found on other publicly available letters from Trump, such as a 2019 letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a 2018 letter sent to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. The image on Facebook also shows the address at the bottom of the note, under Trump’s signature, a detail not seen in other authentic Trump letters examined by Check Your Fact. Several media outlets have reported on Biden’s decision to not reveal the contents of the letter until after he has spoken to Trump. Had Biden revealed what the letter actually said, it would have certainly been reported on, yet no media outlets have published the message. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video actually shows Trump visiting troops stationed in Afghanistan in November 2019.   Fact Check: Over 25,000 National Guard members were deployed to the nation’s capital to bolster security measures for President Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration, according to NBC 4. Ahead of Inauguration Day, social media users shared a Jan. 18 YouTube video that purportedly shows Trump greeting some of the National Guard troops in D.C. in a surprise visit. The video, however, appears to actually come from a trip Trump took in November 2019 to visit soldiers in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving. Former White House Director of Social Media Dan Scavino posted a higher quality version of the video of Trump’s 2019 visit on Twitter.   ????MOMENTS AGO???? President @realDonaldTrump visits U.S. Soldiers at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan…. pic.twitter.com/HpHd6PxEqn — Dan Scavino Jr.???????? (@Scavino45) November 28, 2019  Both videos are the same length and have identical frames, though Scavino’s video appears to be clearer and more zoomed-out. For example, at around the 11-second mark in both videos, Trump can be seen walking into a room while an off-camera person says, “All right, who wants some photos?” The Trump White House YouTube channel also posted a video from the trip on Nov. 28, 2019. The same orange-and-yellow decorations can be seen hanging from the ceiling in all the videos, indicating the footage was shot during the same trip. (RELATED: Can Governors Refuse Trump’s Request To Send The National Guard To The Border?) Media outlets such as CNN and Voice of America covered former Vice President Mike Pence’s surprise visit to National Guard members stationed at the Capitol on Jan. 14, so it’s likely that there would be reporting if Trump had done the same, yet there is none. We rate this claim false.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The video circulated widely ahead of former President Donald Trump departing from Washington, D.C. and President Joe Biden being inaugurated on Wednesday. “The Military Band right outside the White House — ‘Hit The Road Jack,'” reads one Facebook post’s caption. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims The Marine Corps Refused Nancy Pelosi’s Request For Troops For Inauguration Security)  The Daily Caller News Foundation found that the video being shared online has been altered to change the music. CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta shared the original video on Twitter Jan. 18, saying, “Preps for Biden inaugural… you can hear the band playing on WH ground.”  Preps for Biden inaugural… you can hear the band playing on WH grounds. pic.twitter.com/8tBdFy1cDS — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 18, 2021   In Acosta’s video, the band can be heard playing another song that does not resemble “Hit the Road Jack.” The music identification app Shazam links the audio that was inserted into the altered video to a version of “Hit the Road Jack” being performed by the Ohio State University Marching Band. “The Army Band was rehearsing the ‘National Emblem‘ as a part of the military’s precision, teamwork, and dedication to ceremonial excellence,” confirmed Army spokesperson Shaunteh Kelly in an email to the DCNF. “The video was edited. Someone superimposed another band playing ‘Hit the Road Jack.'” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False The CEO of Dominion Voting Systems is co-founder John Poulos. There is no evidence that Terri McCullough, Pelosi’s current chief of staff, holds an executive-level position at the company.   Fact Check: In the months following the 2020 presidential election, the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of numerous baseless allegations. Multiple Facebook users are now attempting to link the company to Pelosi by claiming her current chief of staff is also the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems. The posts include a photo that was posted on Pelosi’s Flickr account in May 2013 and that shows Pelosi as she “joins UC San Francisco Chancellor Susan Desmond-Hellmann and Senator Dianne Feinstein.”  Pelosi announced in March 2019 that McCullough would serve as her chief of staff. There is no mention of McCullough holding an C-level executive position at Dominion Voting Systems on the company’s website. Poulos serves as the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, according to the firm’s website. “This allegation is false,” confirmed Henry Connelly, Pelosi’s director of communications, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother-In-Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) Nadeam Elshami, Pelosi’s former chief of staff, works as part of a lobbying team that represents Dominion Voting Systems, according to Open Secrets public lobbying disclosure records. The company has also used lobbyists with Republican ties, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Dominion Voting Systems states on its website that it has “no ties or company ownership relationships with the Pelosi family, Feinstein family, Clinton family, George Soros, or any ties to the governments of China, Venezuela or Cuba.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The tweet appears to be fabricated. Fact Check:   The internet is replete with fake tweets that are created to look like they come from the verified Twitter accounts of politicians and news outlets. (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tweet That Someone Stole Shoes From Her Office During The Capitol Riot?) In recent days, Facebook and Twitter users have been sharing an alleged CBS News tweet about a Florida man getting arrested for kidnapping over 25 people and “forcing them to play Yahtzee” for 36 hours. The purported Jan. 16 tweet includes a man’s mugshot. Yet, while the tweet appears authentic at first glance, it is indeed fake. A search of the verified CBS News Twitter account, @CBSNews, yielded no matches for the tweet. It does not appear in an archived version of the account’s timeline on Jan. 16. The Daily Caller News Foundation also found no record of CBS News reporting about such an incident.  The mugshot featured in the fake CBS News tweet shows a man who was arrested in March 2016 for burglarizing a Louisiana church, according to a Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office news release. The sheriff’s office said it recovered and returned the stolen property, which included a flat-screen television, DVD player and surround-sound speakers, NOLA.com reported. It is unclear who created the fake CBS News tweet. The fabricated tweet can be found on the popular meme-sharing website iFunny and on various Facebook meme pages.

Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act, it also claims.               View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Donald Livewater (@pzzomoderato)    Verdict: False There is no indication that Biden’s inauguration has been canceled or that the major news networks will have their broadcasting licenses revoked. Trump has acknowledged that Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Check Your Fact has previously debunked the claim that Trump enacted the Insurrection Act.   Fact Check: The image appears to show a screen grab of a Jan. 14 article published by the website Before It’s News that puts up the headline “Inauguration Cancelled, Trump Remains in Office, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MSNBC to Loose (sic) licenses.” The website Before It’s News has published misinformation in the past, including the baseless claim that the commandant of the Marine Corps refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request for 5,000 troops for inauguration security and told her, “We don’t work for you.” There is no indication Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration, which was scaled back due to COVID-19 concerns, has been canceled, contrary to the Instagram post and article’s claim. The Biden-Harris transition team has not put out a press release to that effect. Instead, an official schedule of inaugural events can be found online.  Trump announced on Twitter Jan. 8 that he would not attend Biden’s inauguration. The announcement came after Trump said in a video that he would be “ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power” and that a “new administration will be inaugurated on January 20.” The Instagram post also claims that Trump announced major news networks would be losing their licenses to broadcast. Check Your Fact didn’t find any Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or White House press release announcing the revocation of the networks’ licenses. Ajit Pai, the outgoing FCC chair, said during a 2017 appearance at George Mason University that the FCC “does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast,” CNN reported. On Wednesday, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and PBS will broadcast “Celebrating America,” a 90-minute primetime inaugural special that includes remarks from Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and musical performances from various artists, according to the official inaugural schedule. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Invoke The Insurrection Act?) Check Your Fact has previously debunked the claim that Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. A report from the Congressional Research Service states that the president must first “issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse within a limited time” before invoking the act. Trump has not done so, as Check Your Fact previously reported. NPR reported that Trump will leave the White House and Washington on Wednesday after a departure ceremony at Joint Base Andrews.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

In the unaltered version, the sheet has an Italian message that roughly translates to “Help us Stay at home We cannot.” Fact Check:   The photo being shared on Facebook shows four health care workers dressed in scrubs and medical masks while holding a white sheet that reads, “Jesus stops this virus you can do everything Thank you.” It also includes an image of Jesus’s face. The “virus” mentioned in the message is likely SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, photos of health care workers fighting the virus on the frontlines have been shared widely online. (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Say, ‘Jesus Was A Lot Like Trump, Both Con Artists’?)  The image in the Facebook post has been photoshopped. The Daily Caller News Foundation found the undoctored picture in an article published by the Italian media outlet inews24.it in March 2020. In the unaltered photo, there are Italian words on the sheet that, according to Google Translate, roughly translate to “Help us Stay at home We cannot.”  A rough translation of the March 2020 inews24.it article indicates that the story talks about Italian health care workers urging people to stay at home to help curb the spread of COVID-19. In mid-March last year, media outlets described Italy as the “epicenter” of the pandemic. Over 2 million people across the globe have died from COVID-19 to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Internet users have previously manipulated the words on the sheet being held by the health care workers in the photo to express other messages. For example, one photoshopped version makes the sheet say, “Coronavirus will end soon… In Jesus name, amen!” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The essay was written by conservative writer Evan Sayet and first published in 2017.   Fact Check: Various iterations of the essay have been shared thousands of times over the years. The essay attempts to defend what the posts describe as Trump’s “lack of decorum, dignity and statesmanship” and goes on to compare Trump to Ulysses S. Grant and George Patton by calling him “America’s first wartime president in the Culture War.” “The mayor of Livermore California explains Trump’s popularity and success,” reads the text above the essay allegedly written by Kamena. “This is perhaps the best explanation for Trump’s popularity.”  There is no evidence Kamena wrote the essay attributed to him in the Facebook post, which also alleges he “ran on the Democratic ticket as he knew a Bay Area city would never vote for a Republican” but is “as conservative as they come.” Kamena has not served as the mayor of Livermore since 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. The Livermore mayor application page describes the position as “nonpartisan.” The Daily Caller News Foundation found no credible sources linking Kamena to the essay. Nothing resembling it appears on his Facebook account. An internet search revealed the author is actually Sayet, a conservative writer. Sayet’s piece was originally published by Townhall.com as an op-ed titled “He Fights” in 2017. “I am, in fact, the original author,” Sayet confirmed in an email to the DCNF. (RELATED: Did Dr. Anthony Fauci Write This Viral Essay About COVID-19?) It’s unclear how the essay first became linked to the former Livermore mayor. The misattribution has been debunked by fact-checking outlets such as Snopes, PolitiFact and USA Today over the years. Kamena did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

Spokespeople for the Marine Corps and Pelosi’s office have refuted the story’s claims.   Fact Check: The post features text from an article published by the website Real Raw News that alleges Berger denied Pelosi’s request for Marines to help with Inauguration Day security and prevent a second storming of the U.S. Capitol, saying, “We don’t work for you!” The Real Raw News article cites an alleged “Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity” as its source. “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” the article quotes Berger as telling Pelosi. It later goes on to quote Berger as saying, “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason.”  Check Your Fact didn’t find any national media outlets reporting about the supposed exchange or Pelosi’s request for 5,000 Marines. Raw Real News has previously published misinformation, such as the claim that Delta Force raided a Ukrainian compound belonging to President-elect Joe Biden, according to fact-checking website Snopes. Capt. Joseph Butterfield, a spokesperson for the Marine Corps, told Check Your Fact via email: “The story is entirely false. Every aspect of the article is a complete fabrication.” Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi’s office, also told Reuters that the story is “false.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Batman Arriving At The Capitol Riot?) In a Jan. 12 joint statement to U.S. troops, Berger and the other top U.S. military leaders condemned the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, saying, “Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.” The statement also said that President-elect Biden “will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief” on Jan. 20. While there is no indication of such an exchange between Pelosi and Berger, Pelosi has, according to NBC News, asked retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the U.S. Capitol’s security following the Jan. 6 riot. NPR also reported that Pelosi said she had “been in touch” with the secretary of the Army and head of the Secret Service regarding ensuring requests for inauguration security reinforcements from the Capitol Police are met. The Secret Service officially took charge of inauguration security last week, CNN reported. Over 20,000 National Guardsmen are expected to be in Washington D.C., along with other federal and local law enforcement, to help bolster security for Biden’s inauguration, according to the Washington Post. A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region told Reuters that Marines assigned to the task force units will be “solely providing ceremonial support.” The U.S. Marine Band said in a statement Monday that it will “participate in the Inauguration of the President of the United States on Jan. 20, 2021” and provide “music for the inaugural ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.” The Marine Corps also posted a video of Marines preparing for the inauguration on its website, where they can be seen marching and wearing face masks.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Ted Cruz’s suit. Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The correction is fabricated. A CNN spokesperson confirmed on Twitter that the outlet did not issue the correction. Fact Check:   Facebook and Twitter users on Friday widely shared the screen grab of the alleged CNN correction regarding a Dorito chip and a QAnon pin, with some users appearing to believe it was real. (RELATED: Did CNN Report That Antifa Took Responsibility For Storming The Capitol?) “CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Sen.

CNN Head of Strategic Communications Matt Dornic and reporter Daniel Dale also debunked the supposed correction on Twitter on Friday.

CNN had initially reported that Democratic California Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a crowbar in his office during the Capitol riot, but later clarified that he had actually grabbed a ProBar energy bar. “CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a crowbar before leaving his office,” read that correction. “He grabbed a ProBar energy bar.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that someone stole shoes from her office during the Capitol riot. Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of Ocasio-Cortez posting or deleting the tweet, and it appears to be fabricated. The congresswoman called it “fake” on Twitter. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet that Ocasio-Cortez allegedly posted about the Capitol riot on Jan. 10. Supporters of President Donald Trump on Jan. 6 stormed the U.S. Capitol building, where items such as laptops and documents were stolen and a rioter was photographed carrying away the House speaker’s lectern, according to Forbes. “As most people know by now, many things were stolen during the terrorist insurrection at the Capitol: laptops, mail, even the Speaker’s lectern,” reads the alleged tweet. “Security cameras also picked up a well-disguised fellow about 5’4″ stealing all of my SHOES, for Chrissake. Unbelievable.” There is no record of Ocasio-Cortez tweeting the statement. A search of her Twitter accounts – @AOC and @RepAOC – turned up no matching tweets. It also does not appear in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. The tweet appears to be fabricated.  Ocasio-Cortez called the viral image “fake” in a Jan. 14 tweet.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Mattarella has been arrested. The person the Facebook post suggests is Mattarella is actually outgoing U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster.   Fact Check: The Jan. 8 Facebook post making the claim includes a photo of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo walking outside with a white-haired man behind him who appears to have his arms behind his back. Combined with the caption, the post seemingly suggests the white-haired man in the photo is Mattarella being placed under arrest. There is no evidence Mattarella has been arrested. Had the Italian president been arrested, it would have made headlines around the world, yet none could be found. Mattarella has continued to perform government duties in the week since the Facebook post made the claim, including meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the outgoing and incoming general commanders of the Carabinieri.  Mattarella is also not pictured in the image being shared, further adding to the Facebook post’s dubiousness. The photo, shared on Twitter by Pompeo on Jan. 7, appears to come from the secretary of state’s October 2020 visit to India. Pompeo visited New Delhi, India, from Oct. 26 to 27 last year, according to a fact sheet from the State Department.  Putting #AmericaFirst means helping our friends and partners defend themselves. U.S.-India defense trade grew from near zero in 2008 to > $20B today, including sales of C-17 transports, Apache and MH-60R helicopters, and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. pic.twitter.com/WQ8yFkiCGC — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 7, 2021  In an Oct. 27, 2020 Mint article about Pompeo and then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper meeting with Indian officials during that visit, Pompeo can be seen in a photo with the same white-haired man visible in the Facebook post, both wearing the same clothes and face masks. The caption of the photo, which is credited to PTI, identifies the white-haired man as Juster, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to India. Juster and Pompeo were photographed multiple times together during Pompeo’s October 2020 visit, according to Reuters. Juster also tweeted on Oct. 27 two photos of him welcoming Pompeo in New Delhi. (RELATED: Was Pope Francis Arrested On Charges Including Human Trafficking And Fraud?) Check Your Fact didn’t find any media reports about Juster being arrested while Pompeo was in India. He has continued to perform his professional duties, including delivering a farewell address as ambassador to India last week and giving a speech about the groundbreaking of a new Chancery building this week. The inaccurate claim about Mattarella getting arrested likely originates from a conspiracy theory known as “ItalyGate,” which baselessly suggests Italy meddled in the 2020 presidential election and switched votes from President Donald Trump to President-elect Joe Biden. The conspiracy theory has previously been debunked by USA Today and Reuters.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False   There is no evidence Apple disabled the emergency broadcast system in its latest update, though users may choose to disable emergency alerts on their personal devices. Fact Check: In recent days, some social media users have been sharing posts claiming that “Apple is shutting off the emergency broadcast system through an update.” The posts seem to be referring to the Emergency Alert System, which “allows the president to address the American people within 10 minutes during a national emergency” through “broadcasters, satellite digital audio services, direct broadcast satellite providers, cable television systems and wireless cable systems,” according to the Ready.gov website.  There is, however, no indication that the newest software update did such a thing. The description of Apple’s newest update, iOS 14.3, on Apple’s website does not mention that the emergency alerts were disabled. Such a move is also not mentioned on the webpage about the security content of iOS 14.3. (RELATED: Does Dialing ‘#21#’ Reveal If Your IPhone Is WireTapped?) While Apple does allow users to disable government emergency alerts, this is not a new feature that came with iOS 14.3. A page on Apple’s support website published in August 2019 shows users how to disable government alerts, which are enabled by default. Check Your Fact confirmed on an iPhone that the option to turn off notifications for government alerts is available under the “notifications” section in the settings app. The inaccurate claim appears to originate from a Parler post from pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood, according to Snopes. Wood also claimed that there would be an “imminent blackout” and that President Donald Trump plans to communicate with Americans through the emergency broadcast system. Twitter announced Jan. 8 that Trump was suspended permanently from their platform “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.” Parler, the platform from which Wood made the claim, was shut down by Amazon Web Services for not removing posts that incite violence, according to CNN. Apple did not respond to Check Your Fact’s request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

(@YouthAdvocateKe) January 14, 2021  Verdict: False   The photo predates the 2021 Ugandan presidential election by nearly five years. It shows a police officer carrying a box of election materials during the country’s 2016 presidential election. Fact Check: Ugandans on Thursday voted in the country’s presidential election, according to U.S. News and World Report. Uganda’s electoral commission on Saturday declared President Yoweri Museveni, who was seeking a sixth term, the winner over his main challenger Bobi Wine, who has alleged there was widespread fraud, Reuters reported.  Social media users have been sharing a photo of a law enforcement officer carrying a box with a crowd surrounding him. One Facebook user claimed on Thursday that the photo shows “young people stopping a police man from stealing ballot box in Uganda presidential elections today,” while a Twitter user captioned it, “5:30 Pm Today Ugandan Youths Stopped This Meniac From Running away With the Ballot Box!” The photo, however, does not show a scene from Uganda’s presidential election on Thursday. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the picture was taken near the Ugandan city of Kampala by Ben Curtis for The Associated Press nearly five years ago on Feb. 18, 2016. The country’s 2016 presidential election took place that day, as noted by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. “A police officer struggles to keep hold of a box containing voting materials, as excited voters surround him after waiting over 7 hours without being able to vote, at a polling station in Ggaba, on the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, on Feb. 18, 2016,” reads The Associated Press’ caption. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama And Joe Biden Tweet, ‘#FreeBobiWine’?) During the 2021 Ugandan presidential campaign, Wine and other opposition leaders were beaten and detained on several occasions by authorities, according to The New York Times. In November, dozens of people were killed when security forces responded to riots sparked by Wine’s arrest for allegedly violating COVID-19 restrictions during rallies, CNN reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3809927715734699&set=a.260658853994954&type=3,https://twitter.com/YouthAdvocateKe/status/1349763401602523137,https://twitter.com/hashtag/UgandaDecides?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/YrEbMQ9YvW,https://twitter.com/YouthAdvocateKe/status/1349763401602523137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-01-13/not-worth-my-life-ugandans-vote-in-tense-election,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-election-results/ugandas-museveni-declared-winner-of-presidential-poll-election-commission-idUSKBN29L0FQ,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3809927715734699&set=a.260658853994954&type=3,https://twitter.com/YouthAdvocateKe/status/1349763401602523137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/2016-AP-Year-End-Photos/5a4ec152cb704e25a5beb25a555ec27c/1/0,https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2754/,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/2016-AP-Year-End-Photos/5a4ec152cb704e25a5beb25a555ec27c/1/0,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/23/fact-check-barack-obama-joe-biden-tweets-free-bobi-wine/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/world/africa/uganda-elections-bobi-wine-museveni.html?auth=login-email&login=email,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/23/africa/ugandan-protest-death-toll-intl/index.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1763657261786557747f72747c6e786265717674633974787a",Does This Photo Show Young People Stopping A Police Officer From Stealing A Ballot Box During Uganda’s 2021 Presidential Election?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video actually shows two arrests that occurred in November 2020.   Fact Check: Following the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, social media users have been sharing a TikTok video along with the claim that the footage shows two female rioters being arrested at an airport after returning from Washington, D.C. In the video, one of the women shouts as law enforcement officers lead her out of the building. The video actually predates the Capitol riot by nearly two months. The TikTok user @yungxleen, who originally posted the video on Jan. 9, later shared footage from the same incident with text that said it was “taken in November” and “has nothing to do with the captiol (sic),” adding that “people around us were saying that they didnt (sic) wear masks and assaulted a flight attendant.” In another video TikTok video, the user @yungxlean identified the location of the incident as a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport.  The Tampa Bay Times reported that arrest records from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office for the two women showed the incident in the video occurred at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport last year. Veda Coleman-Wright, the director of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office’s public information office, confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that, as the Tampa Bay Times reported, the arrests of the two women occurred on Nov. 12 last year at that airport. One woman was charged with battery for allegedly “touching or striking” the victim “against her will” and resisting or obstructing a police officer without violence, Broward County court documents show. The other woman was charged with allegedly resisting or obstructing a police officer without violence, according to Broward County court documents. Both have pleaded not guilty. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Capitol Rioter Finding Out He’s On The Federal No-Fly List?) Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that another TikTok video showed a man reacting to getting placed on the federal no-fly list for being recognized at the Capitol riot. Derek Walls, a spokesperson for American Airlines, told Check Your Fact that the man was asked to deplane a Jan. 8 flight for “refusing to comply” with the airline’s mandatory face mask policy. Over 100 people have been arrested in connection to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday, according to Politico. FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D’Antuono said on Jan. 12 that the agency was looking into adding Capitol rioters to the federal no-fly list, CNN reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/miriamrivera27/videos/10158566923310041/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/12/us/capitol-mob-timeline.html,https://www.facebook.com/miriamrivera27/videos/10158566923310041/,https://www.tiktok.com/@yungxleen/video/6915584846752435461?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowSUZE16TQw%2FTmoTDpCfIK9hmlITCS2zm58tRxFR%2FUrt2QjH5OdIiQ%2F6qgcNVP7HmaGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAKKbzeyOa3hWBhi-ak5Ib1zLmYMEBJwFEUqSrU1c0QRPEyMiJ76l-Ms_L8Vyv-gEu&share_item_id=6916182071643835654&share_link_id=1F228B2A-CBAA-4885-B48A-C8247F1F809C&timestamp=1610369105&tt_from=more&u_code=dfli8eh4gh92cg&user_id=6901962317929530374&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=more&source=h5_m,https://www.tiktok.com/@yungxleen/video/6916182071643835654?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowSUZE16TQw/TmoTDpCfIK9hmlITCS2zm58tRxFR/Urt2QjH5OdIiQ/6qgcNVP7HmaGgA=&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAKKbzeyOa3hWBhi-ak5Ib1zLmYMEBJwFEUqSrU1c0QRPEyMiJ76l-Ms_L8Vyv-gEu&share_item_id=6916182071643835654&share_link_id=1F228B2A-CBAA-4885-B48A-C8247F1F809C&timestamp=1610369105&tt_from=more&u_code=dfli8eh4gh92cg&user_id=6901962317929530374&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=more&source=h5_m,https://www.tiktok.com/@yungxleen/video/6915888069207952645?lang=en,https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2021/01/11/florida-airport-arrest-videos-do-not-show-capitol-rioters/,https://www.browardclerk.org/Web2/WebForms/Document.aspx?CaseID=MTEwMTM3NTg%3d-a5HRW1yGTbc%3d&CaseNumber=20006517MM10A&FragmentID=NDc3NzMzMjE%3d-UbmDKtDBqIQ%3d&DtFile=11/13/2020&DocName=File+States+Information&PgCnt=2&UserName=&UserType=ANONYMOUS,https://www.browardclerk.org/Web2/WebForms/Document.aspx?CaseID=MTEwMTM3NTk%3d-5ItvIqBPfqQ%3d&CaseNumber=20006518MM10A&FragmentID=NDc3NTMzMTE%3d-bjHP8YSJ4aM%3d&DtFile=11/13/2020&DocName=File+States+Information&PgCnt=2&UserName=&UserType=ANONYMOUS,https://www.browardclerk.org/Web2/WebForms/Document.aspx?CaseID=MTEwMTM3NTk%3d-5ItvIqBPfqQ%3d&CaseNumber=20006518MM10A&FragmentID=NDc4NjgwNjA%3d-gmuNCPcaToE%3d&DtFile=11/13/2020&DocName=File+Defense+Written+Plea+Of+Not+Guilty&PgCnt=1&UserName=&UserType=ANONYMOUS,https://www.browardclerk.org/Web2/WebForms/Document.aspx?CaseID=MTEwMTM3NTg%3d-a5HRW1yGTbc%3d&CaseNumber=20006517MM10A&FragmentID=NDc5MTkxNTY%3d-sA%2f9C8MLyUU%3d&DtFile=11/13/2020&DocName=File+Defense+Written+Plea+Of+Not+Guilty&PgCnt=1&UserName=&UserType=ANONYMOUS,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/13/fact-check-video-capitol-rioter-federal-no-fly-list-face-mask/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/13/fact-check-video-capitol-rioter-federal-no-fly-list-face-mask/,https://www.facebook.com/100012809193687/videos/vb.100012809193687/1136131043490525/?type=2&theater,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/14/fbi-100-arrests-capitol-riots-459477,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/12/politics/fbi-no-fly-list-capitol-riot/index.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#20545245564f5260434845434b594f5552464143540e434f4d",Does This Video Show Women Being Arrested On Their Way Back From The Capitol Riot?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The toy set isn’t a real Lego product, a spokesperson for the company confirmed. An artist appears to have created the original image of the box as a joke.   Fact Check: Social media has become replete with misinformation surrounding the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol building. This particular Facebook post shows a “Capitol Invasion” toy set, purportedly sold by Lego starting two months ago, that appears to depict a scene from the riot. The alleged Lego set includes a figure with tattoos and a horned hat, seemingly meant to represent Jake Angeli, who, according to The Arizona Republic, is a known supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory that was photographed at the Capitol. The box in the image also says the set has “10621 pieces,” likely a reference to the date the riot occurred.  “Are you still convinced this wasn’t all staged to make Trump and his supporters look bad?” the image’s caption reads. (RELATED: Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict The Horned Rioter Would Storm The Capitol?) The Lego toy set, however, is not real. A search of the toy set on Lego’s website turned up no matches. Amanda Madore, Lego Americas’ marketing senior brand relations manager, told Check Your Fact in an email that “this set is obviously not a real LEGO® product and the social media post has nothing to do with the LEGO Group.” The image of the purported toy set appears to have been first shared on Facebook by artist Adam Padilla on Jan. 7, the day after the riot at the Capitol. Padilla confirmed to Snopes that he had created the image as a joke. A closer look at the box in the image reveals a watermark reading “adam.the.creator,” the name of Padilla’s Facebook page. The “About” section of Padilla’s Facebook page says it shares “daily memes and fake products from the mind of Adam Padilla.” Despite that disclaimer, some social media users appear to believe the Lego set is an actual product for sale.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/david.allen.7921975/posts/10208842081005264,https://www.facebook.com/david.allen.7921975/posts/10208842081005264,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/01/06/arizona-qanon-supporter-jake-angeli-joins-storming-u-s-capitol/6568513002/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/08/fact-check-simpsons-predict-horned-rioter-storm-capitol/,https://www.lego.com/en-us/search?q=capitol%20invasion,https://www.facebook.com/adam.the.creator/photos/a.1327123484076102/3533562530098842/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/capitol-invasion-lego-set/,https://www.facebook.com/adam.the.creator/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3642445340594476555e53555d4f594344505755421855595b","No, Lego Did Not Release A ‘Capitol Invasion’ Toy Set Two Months Ago",,,,,,

Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wearing clothing that features stars arranged in the shape of swastikas.  Verdict: False The image has been digitally altered to add swastikas and a bow, as well as to change the color of Tlaib, Omar and Ocasio-Cortez’s clothing. Two face masks in the photo have also been doctored.   Fact Check: The image shows Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, sometimes collectively referred to as “The Squad,” posing for a photo with two newly sworn-in Democratic members of Congress, Reps. Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. In the photo, three members of the group — Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Omar — appear to have stars on their clothing arranged in the shape of swastikas. “Look at rashida, omar and aoc dress, there is a swastika,” the text above the image reads in part. (RELATED: Does The ‘Squad’ Want The Bible To Be Deemed Hate Speech?)  Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation found that the image has been digitally altered.

In the altered photo, the color of Tlaib, Omar and Ocasio-Cortez’s clothing has been changed partly or fully to red. Bush and Bowman’s masks have also been doctored, and a red bow has been superimposed onto Pressley’s head. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib also shared the undoctored photo on Twitter. Omar, Pressley and Bowman quote-tweeted Bush’s Jan. 3 post, with Pressley and Bowman seemingly making references to “The Squad.” Bush and Bowman were sworn in as members of the 117th Congress on Jan. 3.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False A spokesperson for National Geographic confirmed it is not an authentic cover. The Instagram user who originally posted the fake cover described it as an “imagined cover for artistic expression only.” Fact Check:   India has seen months-long protests by farmers over new agricultural laws that they believe will be harmful to their livelihoods, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Time Magazine Publish A Cover Calling Donald Trump The ‘Worst. President. Ever.’?) In recent days, social media users have shared an image of an alleged National Geographic magazine cover featuring a man in a green turban and highlighting the Indian farmers’ demonstrations. The purported cover, which bears National Geographic’s signature yellow border and the date “Winter 2020,” includes text that says the “largest protest in history is happening now and it is not being televised.” The cover in the Facebook post does not appear in National Geographic’s archive of its published magazines. National Geographic magazine covers typically display the month and year of the issue’s publication. Caitlin Holbrook, a spokesperson for the magazine, confirmed via email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the cover “is indeed fake.”  The handle @anoopreet can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner of the fake cover. The Instagram account @anoopreet posted the fabricated cover on Jan. 3 with the caption disclaiming that it is an “imagined cover for artistic expression only” and crediting the portrait to PTI photojournalist Ravi Choudhary. Choudhary posted the portrait of the man on his Instagram on Dec. 27, 2020. It also appears in a photo gallery on The Quint, where it is credited to him and captioned, “A farmer at Singhu border during their ‘Dehli Chalo’ protest against the new farm laws, on Saturday, 12 December.” India’s supreme court on Tuesday suspended the implementation of the three agricultural laws at the center of the farmers’ protests until further notice, CNN reported. Despite the court order, farming unions said they would continue demonstrations, according to The Guardian.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of Obama tweeting the statement. The tweet appears to be fabricated. Fact Check:   Twitter announced in a Jan. 8 statement that it had permanently suspended President Donald Trump’s account “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.” The company had previously temporarily suspended his account for 12 hours over several tweets about his supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, according to CBS News. Following Trump’s permanent suspension, Facebook users began sharing an image that appears to show a screen grab of a Jan. 9 tweet from Obama, seemingly poking fun at Trump’s suspension from the platform. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet That He Regrets Shaking Hands With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi?) “Man do I love having this Twitter account, the ability to connect to so many millions of people, to express my feelings and views, to know that all major media outlets and world leaders are reading these words, that they are recorded for posterity,” reads the alleged tweet. “How awesome is that?”  The tweet, however, appears to have been fabricated. A search of the former president’s verified Twitter account, @BarackObama, turned up no matching tweet. Archived screen grabs of Obama’s Twitter profile on Jan. 9, the day the alleged tweet was sent, likewise do not show the tweet. Media outlets also didn’t report on Obama tweeting such a thing. While Obama doesn’t appear to have publicly commented on Trump’s Twitter suspension, his wife, Michelle Obama, did encourage Twitter and other social media companies to remove Trump from their platforms the day before Twitter did so.  pic.twitter.com/2xhMyVMpDF — Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) January 7, 2021   “Now is the time for Silicon Valley companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior and go even further than they have already by permanently banning this man from their platforms,” she wrote in a Jan. 7 statement she posted on her Twitter account.

Verdict: False The man in the video was asked to deplane an American Airlines flight for refusing to comply with the airline’s mandatory face mask policy, according to a statement from American Airlines.   Fact Check:  Rioters supporting President Donald Trump breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 as Congress met to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election, according to CNN. Facebook users are now sharing a TikTok video that they claim shows a man who “just found out he’s on the no-fly list after being recognized inside the Capitol Building.” The federal no-fly list is a “small subset of the U.S. government Terrorist Screening Database (also known as the terrorist watchlist) that contains the identity information of known or suspected terrorists,” according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D’Antuono told reporters Tuesday, “As for the no-fly list, we look at all tools and techniques that we can possibly use within the FBI and that’s something we are actively looking at,” according to CNN.  The video does not show a man reacting to getting put on the no-fly list for participating in the Capitol riot. TikTok user @heartlessbeech, who previously used the handle @heartlessputa, originally posted the video on Jan. 10 with the caption saying, “Homeboy had a full toddler level meltdown bc he was told to wear a mask.” She later posted videos saying that the incident was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina and clarifying that she didn’t “actually know for sure” the reason for the man’s removal because she was too far away. Derek Walls, a spokesperson for American Airlines, provided Check Your Fact a statement from the airline about the incident depicted in the video. The emailed statement confirmed the man was asked to deplane for “refusing to comply with our mandatory face covering policy,” not for being placed on the federal no-fly list. (RELATED: Did The FBI Confirm That Antifa Activists Stormed The Capitol?) “On Friday, Jan. 8, a customer was asked to deplane flight 1754 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) for refusing to comply with our mandatory face covering policy,” the statement reads. “The customer complied with requests to deplane, and the flight departed at 7:42 p.m. EST for Denver International Airport (DEN).” The statement said that American Airlines “requires all individuals two years and older to wear face coverings throughout the travel journey—at airports and on board.” The American Airlines website also notes that if a person declines to wear one, they “may be denied boarding and future travel on American.” There have been calls from lawmakers to put the Capitol rioters on the federal no-fly list. On Jan. 7, Democratic Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, urged TSA and the FBI in a statement to “use their authorities to add the names of all identified individuals involved in the attack to the federal No-Fly List and keep them off planes.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also called for the rioters to be added to the list, according to NBC News.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that it is time to “roundup all Conservative traitors.” Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever sending or deleting the tweet. It appears to have been fabricated. Fact Check:   Congress certified Biden as the winner of the election early on Jan. 7, according to CNN, and he is set to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Ocasio-Cortez has previously voiced her support of President-elect Joe Biden, Bloomberg reported. The image claims to show a screen grab of a tweet from Ocasio-Cortez that reads in part, “Congrats to President Joe Biden. Now let’s begin ‘The Purge’ to roundup all Conservative traitors!” Some users also alleged that Ocasio-Cortez deleted the purported tweet, which goes on to make an anti-Semitic statement. In reality, there is no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever tweeting or deleting the message. A search of both Ocasio Cortez’s verified Twitter accounts – @AOC and @RepAOC – turned up no matches for the tweet. Check Your Fact also searched ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets and found no evidence of her deleting it. The statement in the purported tweet can’t be found in any of her other social media posts either.  If Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted the comment, it likely would have garnered media coverage, yet Check Your Fact didn’t find any media reports about her making the statement. The tweet appears to be fabricated. (RELATED: Did Kayleigh McEnany Delete ‘5 Days Or So’ Of Tweets After The Election?) Ocasio-Cortez is often the target of online misinformation. In June 2020, social media users falsely claimed the New York congresswoman tweeted, “It’s vital that Governors maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected.” That tweet was also fake.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1398748090473516&id=100010150142664,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html,https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2021/01/08/954865776/trump-wont-attend-inauguration-congress-pushes-ahead-with-capitol-ceremony,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/ocasio-cortez-says-young-voters-are-pragmatic-will-back-biden,https://www.facebook.com/lori.morel/posts/10219110044804492,https://www.facebook.com/lori.morel/posts/10219110044804492,https://twitter.com/search?q=Now%20let%27s%20begin%20%22The%20Purge%22%20(from%3AAOC)&src=typed_query,https://twitter.com/search?q=Now%20let%27s%20begin%20%22The%20Purge%22%20(from%3A%20RepAOC)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/AOC,https://www.facebook.com/page/1316372698453411/search/?q=Congrats%20to%20President%20Joe%20Biden.%20Now%20let%27s%20begin%20%22The%20Purge%22%20to%20roundup%20all%20Conservative%20traitors!,https://www.facebook.com/page/389432195138655/search/?q=Congrats%20to%20President%20Joe%20Biden.%20Now%20let%27s%20begin%20%22The%20Purge%22%20to%20roundup%20all%20Conservative%20traitors!,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%22The+Purge%22+site:https://www.instagram.com/aoc/+OR+site:https://www.instagram.com/repaoc/&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/09/fact-check-kayleigh-mcenany-delete-five-days-tweets-election/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/23/fact-check-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tweet-governors-maintain-coronavirus-restrictions-businesses-november-elections/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5a1a7b0a3baa795b6bdb0b6beacbaa0a7b3b4b6a1fbb6bab8",Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tweet That It’s Time To ‘Roundup All Conservative Traitors’?,,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no indication Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act. The Parler account that made the claim does not appear to belong to the Trump campaign.   Fact Check:  The image shows a screen grab of a post from the Parler account @TeamTrumpNews. The account @TeamTrumpNews does not appear to belong to the Trump campaign, which posted on Parler with the handle @TeamTrump. Parler went offline after Amazon Web Services removed the social networking site from its cloud hosting service, according to CNBC. The @TeamTrumpNews screen grab alleges that Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 to “address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat & Republican lawmakers, CCP agents, the FBI, DOJ, CIA & others to undermine, corrode and dismantle the United States of America and its Constitution.” It goes on to say he will “remain president indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  The Insurrection Act, which has been amended several times since 1807, gives the president the power to deploy the military within the U.S. to maintain order in some circumstances, according to NPR. The Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992 to quell riots that erupted in Los Angeles after the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King, CNN reported. There is no evidence that Trump has invoked the act. Such a move would likely warrant widespread media coverage; however, Check Your Fact only found media reports debunking the claim. The list of presidential actions available on the White House website shows no record of Trump enacted the Insurrection Act. Robert Peck, a constitutional attorney and president of the Center for Constitutional Litigation, told WUSA 9 that the president must first issue a public proclamation asking “those who are the insurgents to cease and desist and go back to their homes peaceably, and give them the opportunity to do that.” A report from the Congressional Research Service also states that the president must first “issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse within a limited time,” citing Title 10 of the U.S. Code. “Whenever the President considers it necessary to use the militia or the armed forces under this chapter, he shall, by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents or those obstructing the enforcement of the laws to disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time,” the Insurrection Act states. There is no record of Trump issuing such a proclamation. Trump said in a Jan. 7 video that he would be “ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power” and that a “new administration will be inaugurated on January 20.” (RELATED: Did NPR Publish A Headline About The Capitol Riot Before It Occurred?) When asked about the image’s claim, the Pentagon’s Office of Public Affairs directed Check Your Fact to the White House.

Verdict: False The video shows a man dressed as Batman at a Philadelphia protest that took place last year after George Floyd’s death.   Fact Check: Genuine photos and videos taken as rioters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol have circulated widely on the internet since Jan. 6. Facebook and Twitter users are now sharing a short clip of a Batman impersonator at a protest along with the claim that it was taken at the Capitol riot last week. (RELATED: Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict The Horned Rioter Would Storm The Capitol) Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered that the video has been circulating since late May 2020. The verified Instagram account Bucks County Batman posted the video on May 30 last year with the location tagged as the Philadelphia City Hall and the hashtags referencing Floyd and Black Lives Matter.                View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by ???????????????????? ???????????????????????? ???????????????????????? (@buckscountybatman)    The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a man dressed as Batman was present outside Philadelphia City Hall on May 30, 2020, at a protest sparked by Floyd’s death. The outlet identified the man in the video as Bob Gable, a Pennsylvania man who owns a Batsuit and is also known as the Bucks County Batman.  Gable said he went to the Philadelphia protest to “help in any way that I could,” The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. In the video being shared, a man can be seen holding a “Justice for George Floyd” sign. The facade of the building in the background also matches that of Philadelphia’s city hall on Google Maps. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25 last year after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. His death sparked protests against police brutality and racial injustice across the U.S. and abroad.

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Pope Francis was arrested. The claim stemmed from an article by a website that has previously published misinformation.   Fact Check: The image on Facebook appears to show a screen grab of a Jan. 10 article published by the website Conservative Beaver titled, “VATICAN BLACKOUT: Pope arrested on 80 count indictment for Child Trafficking, Fraud.” The Conservative Beaver is a self-described Canadian conservative news website that publishes “news from your favourite alternative sources.” “Pope Francis aka Jorge Mario Bergoglio was arrested Saturday in connection with an 80- count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud,” the screen grab reads.  The Conservative Beaver article goes on to suggest that electricity had to be cut off in the Vatican so that military officials could make the arrest on Saturday. The Conservative Beaver also claimed that Italy’s chief anti-mafia prosecutor Giuseppe Governale commented, “These individuals are truly the worst of the worst in society. I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in the Vatican and Italy, as well as surrounding countries around Europe.” There is, however, no evidence of Pope Francis being arrested. If Pope Francis had been arrested, major media outlets and Catholic news outlets would have reported on it, yet none have. The Holy See press office likewise has not published a press release about the supposed incident. A video on the Vatican News YouTube channel shows Pope Francis reciting the Angelus prayer on Jan. 10, the day after he was purportedly arrested, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Pope Francis also sent several tweets from his verified Twitter account that same day. The alleged Governale quote actually appears to be an altered version of a quote from Alabama police sheriff Kevin Turner, according to a tweet from the Madison County, Alabama sheriff’s office. Turner is quoted as saying a very similar statement in the sheriff’s office’s Jan. 7 tweet thread about an individual in Madison County who was indicted on 75 counts. The Catholic News Agency published an article addressing the Conservative Beaver article’s claims, saying there was no evidence of the incident and “not a single established news outlet reported a disturbance at the Vatican on Saturday.” Vatican correspondent Colm Flynn, who lives near the Vatican, said he “didn’t notice any power outage” and Mountain Butorac, a tour guide who lives near the Vatican, wrote on his blog The Catholic Traveler that there was no massive blackout. “I looked out my window (I can see the Vatican from my apartment) lights were on,” Butorac wrote. “No gunfights. No police. Cars were coming and going as usual on an early winter Sunday morning.” The Conservative Beaver has previously published misinformation. In December, Check Your Fact debunked an article from the website claiming that former President Barack Obama had been arrested on espionage charges.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Ramsey refuted the attribution in a tweet.   Fact Check: A group of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 while Congress met to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, CNN reported. Biden was affirmed the winner of the election by Congress early Jan. 7, according to the outlet. Some social media users, seemingly in response to the riot, shared a lengthy statement attributed to Ramsey, reading in part, “You can’t justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind.” (RELATED: Did Dave Ramsey Write This Statement Advocating Against A ‘Cashless Society’?)  “We are clearly living in an upside-down world where right is wrong and wrong is right, where moral is immoral and immoral is moral, where good is evil and evil is good, where killing murderers is wrong, but killing innocent babies is right,” the essay continues. However, there is no evidence Ramsey is the original author of the post, which has been circulating online without attribution since at least July 2020. A search of Ramsey’s verified social media accounts found no instances of the statement. Nor was the statement found in any of Ramsey’s published work or on his official website. Angela Schatz, a public relations coordinator for Ramsey Solutions, said in an email that “this is not from Dave and we are unsure who the author may be.” She also directed Check Your Fact to a tweet Ramsey sent on Jan. 7.

Spokespeople for both Pelosi and Wheeler have said that it is not real. Fact Check:   Facebook users are sharing a letter, purportedly sent by Pelosi to Wheeler in August, that addresses riots and protests that occurred in Portland, Oregon. The letter has circulated following the U.S. Capitol being stormed on Jan. 6 by pro-Trump rioters, some of whom were photographed in Pelosi’s office. In the letter, Pelosi allegedly urges Wheeler to “stick to the proven Democratic Play book” in response to riots in his city before listing five points of action. The five points include “deny there is a problem,” “refer to everything as peaceful and calm” and “blame Trump.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Send This Tweet About Her Home Being Vandalized?) Portland experienced months of protests and riots following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, in Minneapolis police custody, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Wheeler faced criticism from both President Donald Trump and Black Lives Matter activists for his handling of the unrest in the city, according to NBC News.  There is no evidence the letter is authentic. While it includes an official-looking letterhead and a signature, it features informal language and multiple grammatical errors that make it immediately suspect. The language also does not appear to resemble that used in publicly available letters on the speaker’s official government website. “The letter is not real,” confirmed Timothy Becker, a spokesperson for Wheeler, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. The DCNF reached out to Pelosi’s office but did not hear back by the time of publication. Pelosi’s office told The Associated Press that the letter was not authentic. Journalists such as Brendan Keefe, a chief investigative reporter for the news station 11Alive, and Mikael Thalen reported that the letter shows signs of digital fabrication. Both said that the signature and seal of a real letter on eBay had been digitally added to the fake letter.

Verdict: False   The Twitter user who originally shared the image clarified that he created it as a joke. Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, confirmed that the statement is fake. Fact Check: Rioters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 in an attempt to halt the certification process of President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Following the Capitol riot, numerous social media users shared an alleged statement from Olive Garden announcing the revocation of Hannity’s Lifetime Pasta Pass and several other guests’ Never Ending Pasta Passes. The supposed statement, which features Olive Garden’s logo at the top, links the alleged pass revocations to the storming of the Capitol. “In response, Olive Garden has invalidated our Never Ending Pasta Pass for several guests and revoked a Lifetime Pasta Pass for Sean Hannity,” the supposed statement reads in part. (RELATED: Did Olive Garden Ban Employees From Wearing American Flag Face Masks?) There is, however, no record of Olive Garden announcing that it “revoked a Lifetime Pasta Pass for Sean Hannity.” Olive Garden and its parent company Darden Restaurants have not put out a press release to that effect on their respective websites, and the alleged announcement does not appear on Olive Garden’s verified Twitter account. Darden Restaurants confirmed to Check Your Fact that it is fake. The image originated in a tweet from the verified Twitter user and Portland designer Louie Mantia Jr. In a Jan. 8 Twitter thread, Mantia clarified that he made the fake statement as a joke and has since deleted it.  This morning I made a “social media statement”-style joke image as if it had come from Olive Garden, and I want to talk about why I made it and why I deleted it. Just so I’m abundantly clear: it’s not a real statement. pic.twitter.com/hTf2ymub5P — Louie Mantia, Jr. (@Mantia) January 8, 2021  “This morning I made a ‘social media statement’-style joke image as if it had come from Olive Garden, and I want to talk about why I made it and why I deleted it,” he tweeted. “Just so I’m abundantly clear: it’s not a real statement.” Mantia appeared to cite comments from CNN host Anderson Cooper and Hannity as part of his inspiration for the fake Olive Garden statement. Hannity said on his show that he liked Olive Garden after Cooper seemingly quipped that the Capitol Hill rioters would “go back to the Olive Garden and to the Holiday Inn they’re staying at,” according to Bloomberg. Cooper clarified on Friday that he was “not dissing” the restaurant chain and that he was “trying to remark about the seemingly casualness of the behavior that we were all witnessing at that moment after the attack.” Hannity also addressed the fake Olive Garden statement on his show, saying that social media claims that he had lost a Lifetime Pasta Pass were “not true,” according to Vox. It’s unclear if Hannity held a Lifetime Pasta Pass.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The FBI has not issued such a confirmation to date. Assistant FBI Director Steven D’Antuono said Jan. 8 that there is no indication members of antifa disguised themselves as Trump supporters and participated in the mob at the Capitol.   Fact Check: Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol while Congress attempted to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, according to CNN. Biden was certified the winner of the presidential election early Jan. 7, the outlet reported. In the days since the riot, some social media users have baselessly claimed that the people responsible for storming the Capitol were not actually Trump supporters, but rather members of antifa pretending to be Trump supporters, the Washington Post reported. This particular Facebook post purports that the FBI has “just confirmed that it was ANTIFA, not Trump supporters” who were responsible for breaching the Capitol.  “It’s reported that 2 captured had MAGA hats on as a ruse,” the post continues in part. “Remember who ANTIFA works to promote and how they work.” (RELATED: Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict The Horned Rioter Would Storm The Capitol?) The FBI has not made such a confirmation to date. A search of the FBI’s website turned up no results for a statement confirming that those who stormed the Capitol were members of antifa. Check Your Fact also searched the FBI’s verified Facebook and Twitter accounts but found no similar statements. Assistant FBI Director Steven D’Antuono told reporters on Jan. 8 that the FBI had “no indication” at this time that members of antifa had disguised themselves as Trump supporters to provoke the mob at the Capitol, CNBC reported. Evidence-less claims that pro-Trump rioters photographed breaching the Capitol were antifa activists have circulated widely online since Jan. 6, according to The New York Times. Check Your Fact has previously debunked false allegations that specific demonstrators pictured in the Capitol during the riot were antifa activists, including one false claim that Jake Angeli, the shirtless man photographed wearing a horned hat in the Capitol, is part of antifa.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158101011277452&set=a.412673497451&type=3,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/no-theres-no-substantive-evidence-that-capitol-riot-was-spurred-by-antifa/,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3611522105551142&id=100000801657215,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/08/fact-check-simpsons-predict-horned-rioter-storm-capitol/,https://www.fbi.gov/@@search?SearchableText=antifa&searchHelpText=To+narrow+your+search%2C+select+a+content+type+option+listed+under+%E2%80%9CMore.%E2%80%9D+To+broaden+your+search+to+other+FBI+sites%2C+select+a+subdomain+listed+under+%E2%80%9CSource.%E2%80%9D&pageSize=20&page=1&sort_on=&sort_order=descending&after=,https://www.facebook.com/page/72092591211/search/?q=Antifa,https://twitter.com/search?q=Antifa%20(from%3AFBI)&src=typed_query,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/fbi-says-no-indication-that-antifa-took-part-in-us-capitol-riot.html,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions?auth=login-email&login=email,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/08/fact-check-cnn-report-antifa-taken-responsibility-storming-capitol/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/07/fact-check-man-horned-hat-capitol-antifa-trump-supporter/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/08/fact-check-photographic-evidence-rioter-capitol-antifa/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#11656374677e6351727974727a687e6463777072653f727e7c",Did The FBI Confirm That Antifa Activists Stormed The Capitol?,,,,,,

Verdict: False While the article was originally published at 9:33 a.m., its headline did not mention rioters storming the Capitol before the incident took place. Archived versions of the article show the story and headline were updated throughout the day, including later in the day to reflect the Capitol riot, as the events took place.   Fact Check:  Rioters supporting President Donald Trump breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to CNN. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims To Show ‘Photographic Evidence’ That The Rioter Pictured Is An Antifa Member) Facebook users have since been sharing a screen grab of an NPR article, currently titled “Trump Supporters Storm U.S. Capitol, Clash With Police,” with a red arrow pointing to the 9:33 a.m. time stamp beneath the headline. The captions of such posts use the screen grab in an attempt to baselessly suggest that the Capitol riot was staged or a “false flag” attack.  While NPR did originally publish the article at 9:33 a.m. on Jan. 6, it did not bear the headline shown in the screen grabs at that time. The article’s URL shows that the original headline did not mention Trump supporters storming the Capitol. The story was later updated to include information about the Capitol riot, as evidenced by the line “Updated 3:08 p.m. EST” and archived versions of the article on the Wayback Machine. A version of the article archived on the Wayback Machine around 10:10 a.m. EST shows the page reads “Congress’ Electoral College Tally: Live Updates” and “Diehard Trump Supporters Gather In the Nation’s Capital To Protest Election Results.” Another version archived around 1:15 p.m. EST on Jan. 6 reads “‘We Are Patriots’: Trump Supporters Gather In D.C. To Protest Biden’s Win.” Ben Fishel, an NPR spokesperson, confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that the “original story was posted at 9:33am and the title and text was updated throughout the day,” adding, “I can confirm that NPR is neither clairvoyant nor were we a part of a (false) conspiracy of people who staged the events of Wednesday.” Check Your Fact has debunked multiple claims related to the Capitol riot, including ones falsely alleging that people pictured at the Capitol during the riot are part of antifa. Evidence-less claims that people filmed and photographed breaking into the Capitol with pro-Trump flags and clothing were antifa activists started circulating widely on Jan. 6, NBC News reported. Congress reconvened after the riot to resume the certification process and finalized President-elect Joe Biden’s win early Jan. 7, Politico reported. Biden received 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232, according to the National Archives.

Verdict: False The photo actually shows the crowds at the 2018 “March for Our Lives” pr0-gun control rally.   Fact Check: Thousands of Trump supporters gathered in the nation’s capital in the days leading up to Jan. 6, the day Congress was set to meet to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, the Washington Post reported. A group of protesters met in Freedom Plaza on Jan. 5 to protest the results of the election, according to the outlet. A Jan. 5 Facebook post features an image of large crowds on Pennsylvania Avenue with the U.S. Capitol in the background, purportedly “protesting the stop the steal.”  The image, however, does not show pro-Trump protests in early January. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo actually depicts the “March For Our Lives” anti-gun violence rally that took place in Washington on March 24, 2018, according to its Getty Images caption. “Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, including students, teachers, and parents are expected to gather for the anti-gun violence rally, spurred largely by the shooting that took place on Valentine’s Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida where 17 people died,” the caption reads. Over 200,000 people were estimated to have attended the 2018 “March for Our Lives” event in Washington, according to CBS News, and 800 cities worldwide hosted associated events that same day.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False Pence did not resign on Dec. 31, 2020. He has performed vice presidential duties since then, including presiding over Congress certifying the Electoral College votes. Fact Check:   The image appears to show a screen grab of a Dec. 31 post on an online messaging board along with a photo of Pence. (RELATED: Did Mike Pence Change His Twitter Cover Photo To One Of Kamala Harris And Joe Biden?) “Pence has resigned as Vice President effective immediately,” reads the message in part. “It’s why Trump and Pence both cancelled their New Year’s plans last minute. Pence doesn’t agree with the direction of the election challenges and doesn’t want to be pressured to reject the electors.” The vice president did not resign on Dec. 31. Had he done so, his resignation would have been covered by major media outlets, yet none did. The White House also did not put out a press release to that effect, and Pence did not announce such a thing on social media.  Furthermore, he has performed vice presidential duties since Dec. 31. Pence presided over Congress’s counting of the Electoral College votes, which finalized President-elect Joe Biden’s win early Thursday morning, Politico reported. Trump had previously urged Pence to reject some of the Electoral College votes, according to The New York Times. In a Jan. 6 letter to Congress, Pence said he did not believe he had the power to reject them. “Vesting the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide presidential contests would be entirely antithetical to that design,” he wrote. “As a student of history who loves the Constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe the Founders of our country intended to vest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress, and no Vice President in history has ever asserted such authority.” Rioters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday following a pro-Trump rally in an attempt to stop the certification of the Electoral College votes, The Associated Press reported. Congress later reconvened and finalized Biden’s electoral victory.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The image has been digitally altered.   Fact Check: Supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday while Congress attempted to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, according to The New York Times. In the days since the riot, some social media users have baselessly suggested that those who breached the Capitol were not actually Trump supporters, but instead members of antifa disguised as Trump supporters. This particular Facebook post attempts to claim that CNN reported on-air that antifa, a group of loosely affiliated antifascist activists, had taken responsibility for the riot. In the image, a purported CNN news chyron reads, “Antifa Has Just Taken Responsiblitly (sic) For Storming Capital (sic) Hill.”  The incorrect spelling of the words “responsibility” and “Capitol” make the chyron immediately suspect. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation found that the chyron has been digitally manipulated. The original chyron, which can be seen in a Jan. 6 video broadcast on CNN, actually reads, “The Presidential Election: Congress Counts the Vote.” CNN has not reported that members of antifa took responsibility for the Capitol riot. A search of CNN’s website turned up no results for any reports of antifa leading Wednesday’s riot. (RELATED: Did CNN Air This Chyron About ‘Two Deadly Viruses’ Killing Nigerians?) Check Your Fact has previously addressed allegations about supposed members of antifa being involved in the Capitol riot, including the claim that Jake Angeli, the shirtless man photographed wearing a horned hat in the Capitol, is part of antifa. Angeli is a known QAnon supporter who The Arizona Republic described as a “fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The image did not come from “The Simpsons,” a spokesperson for the show confirmed. It is a doctored version of the character “Groundskeeper Willie” that started circulating after the storming of the Capitol. Fact Check:   Hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, according to The New York Times. Images from the Capitol riot quickly spread on social media, including several that show a horned hat-wearing man, whom media outlets have identified as Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter who has attended pro-Trump events in the past. Facebook users are now suggesting the long-running animated show “The Simpsons” predicted that Angeli would be pictured at the Capitol during the riot. The Facebook posts juxtapose a photo of Angeli with an image of a shirtless animated “The Simpsons”-esque character with the same tattoos and horned hat waving a flag on what appears to be the steps of the Capitol. Text above the image reads, “Definitely not staged if the Simpsons predicted it.”  While some fans believe “The Simpsons” has accurately predicted several future events, there is no record of “The Simpsons” airing the image of the animated character resembling Angeli. Antonia Coffman, a spokesperson for the show, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the cartoon image did not originate from “The Simpsons.” “No, that is not from our show….we did not create that image,” Coffman said. “It was created by the internet.” (RELATED: Did ‘The Simpsons’ Depict Donald Trump In A Casket?) Matt Selman, executive producer for “The Simpsons,” also tweeted on Thursday that the show “did not PREDICT this,” adding, “Someone made this yesterday AFTER it happened.”  To clarify: @TheSimpsons did not PREDICT this. Someone made this yesterday AFTER it happened. pic.twitter.com/wYK67Zqsd0 — Matt Selman (@mattselman) January 7, 2021   The image appears to be a doctored version of the character “Groundskeeper Willie.” In unaltered versions of “Groundskeeper Willie” making that pose, he does not have a horned hat, tattoos or face paint. Though the cartoon image in the Facebook posts didn’t originate from “The Simpsons,” the show has depicted violence occurring at the Capitol in the past. In the episode “The Day the Violence Died,” anthropomorphic legislative bills carrying guns and bombs run up the steps of the Capitol. The episode “Beyond Blunderdome” depicts the Capitol getting blown up. This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.

Verdict: False Pence does not appear to have changed his Twitter cover photo since early November. The image shows Pence and his wife, not Biden and Harris, according to a spokesperson for Pence.   Fact Check:  Pence was presiding over a joint session of Congress certifying the Electoral College vote when a group of Trump supporters breached the Capitol and temporarily occupied it in protest of the election results, according to The Associated Press. President Donald Trump had previously urged Pence to not certify the election results, though Pence later said in a letter that he did not believe the vice president had the power to reject them, CNBC reported. Some social media users have suggested that Pence changed his cover photo on Twitter to one showing Biden and Harris, seemingly in response to his disagreement with Trump about approving the election results. But in reality, Pence has not changed his Twitter header image in a few months.  (RELATED: Was Mike Pence Pictured Waving A Confederate Flag?)  He appears to have last changed his Twitter cover photo on Nov. 3. In one archived version of his Twitter account on Nov. 3, it shows Pence and his wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, waving from behind a podium. An archived version of his account from later that day shows that it switched to another photo: a white-haired man in a black coat holding hands with a woman wearing a round hat. Various archived versions of Pence’s Twitter account from Nov. 4 to Jan. 8, including the day he presided over Congress certifying the Electoral College votes, all show that it has not changed from that photo of the pair holding hands. Devin O’Malley, the vice president’s press secretary, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the cover photo “is of the VP and the Second Lady.” The image most likely shows Pence at a Nov. 2 campaign rally with his wife in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Images taken at the event from a different angle shows Pence wearing the same coat and his wife wearing the same hat as in his Twitter cover photo. In addition, AP images show the fabric decorations surrounding the stage during the Grand Rapids, Michigan, rally match the ones in the cover image.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While the photos show similar-looking bearded men, they are not “evidence” the bearded man pictured in the Capitol is part of antifa. The man pictured on the PhillyAntifa.org website was identified by the website as a member of a neo-Nazi group, not antifa.   Fact Check: On Wednesday, rioters breached the U.S. Capitol following a pro-Trump rally against the presidential election results, CNN reported. Some social media users have attempted to suggest that the Trump supporters photographed inside the Capitol building are actually members of antifa. This particular Facebook post shows a screen grab of a Parlor post from pro-Trump attorney L. Lin Wood. The Parler post juxtaposes two photos: one of a bearded man that was tweeted by Huffington Post politics reporter Igor Bobic from inside the Capitol and one showing a similar-looking man that supposedly comes from the website PhillyAntifa.org.  “Indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today to inflict harm & do damage. NOT @Name Hidden supporters,” reads Wood’s Parler post in part. “Do not be fooled.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims A Facial Recognition Firm Identified Members Of Antifa At The US Capitol) While the photo on the right does appear on the PhillyAntifa.org website, it does not constitute “photographic evidence” of antifa members in the Capitol. The PhillyAntifa.org website included the picture of the similar-looking bearded man in a post that calls him a “longtime neo-Nazi.” Check Your Fact has not identified the man that was pictured in the Capitol. The man pictured in the Capitol during the riot can also be seen in an AFP photo, where the tattoo on his right hand is visible. That tattoo on his right hand does not appear to match the one on the right hand of the man discussed in the PhillyAntifa.org post. In the photo on the left in the Parler post, a man wearing a horned fur hat can also be seen. Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that Jake Angeli, the shirtless man pictured wearing that hat and face paint in the Capitol breach, is part of antifa. Angeli is a known QAnon supporter who The Arizona Republic described as a “fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year.” Four people, including one woman who was shot by police and three people who suffered apparent medical emergencies, died during the storming of the Capitol, according to CNN. On Thursday, a Capitol police officer also died from injuries sustained while physically engaging with protesters, according to NBC News.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no truth to the rumor about 19 female bodies being found near the Springwater Corridor in Portland, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Fact Check:   The viral image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a social media post that shows a series of block texts, along with red text that reads, “ATTENTION FEMALES This is happening in SE Portland.” The image alleges that 19 female bodies have been found near the Springwater Corridor, a popular pedestrian trail in the greater Portland area, and that “a lot of the bodies matched missing persons.” Text in the image also suggests that the information is being withheld from the public because Oregon Gov. Kate Brown “doesn’t want to freak people out” and that a serial killer may be responsible for the deaths. The discovery of multiple bodies, possibly the victims of a serial killer, would likely result in media coverage. However, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any media reports about 10 bodies being found near Southeast Flavel Street or nine being found by Southeast Sellwood Boulevard.  The verified Portland Police Twitter account also addressed such claims in a Jan. 4 tweet.  PPB is aware of viral posts on social media regarding an alleged serial killer and a number of bodies being found near the Springwater Corridor. There is no truth to these rumors. Please do not share posts such as these that are designed to ignite fear in the community. — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) January 4, 2021   “PPB is aware of viral posts on social media regarding an alleged serial killer and a number of bodies being found near the Springwater Corridor,” the tweet says. “There is no truth to these rumors. Please do not share such posts as these that are designated to ignite fear in the community.” When asked about the Facebook image’s claims, Portland Police Bureau Public Information Officer Derek Carmon confirmed to the DCNF via email: “There is no truth to this.” (RELATED: Did Police Recently Make A Human Trafficking Bust At A Walmart In Midland, Texas?) The Portland Police Bureau similarly refuted the rumor in comments to Fox News and Portland-based CBS affiliate KOIN 6 News. Carmon told KOIN 6 News that such incidents have not been reported to or investigated by local law enforcement agencies, nor have they been confirmed by any. “Certainly, if the Portland Police Bureau were called to such an incident, we would let the public know and I’m sure many other partners would be involved in such a thing,” Carmon said, according to KOIN 6 News. The Portland Police Bureau said it does not “know who is responsible for that post,” Carmon told Fox News in a statement.

Verdict: False The facial recognition firm denied that it identified members of antifa in the mob that stormed the Capitol. The Washington Times retracted the article and later published a correction.   Fact Check: Rioters with pro-Trump flags and clothing stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as Congress attempted to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Viral  Posts Falsely Claim Man Wearing A Horned Hat In The Capitol Is Antifa) Facebook users have been sharing a screen grab of a Washington Times article that alleged the facial recognition firm XRVision identified some of the rioters as members of antifa, a group of loosely affiliated antifascist activists. The article claimed that a “retired military officer” gave the newspaper the firm’s photo match.  However, XRVision denied it had identified antifa activists in a statement to BuzzFeed News that called the Washington Times story “outright false, misleading, and defamatory.” BuzzFeed News first reported on the company refuting the Washington Times article. Yaacov Apelbaum, the chief technology officer for XRVision, also appeared to address the article on his blog. “XRVision didn’t generate any composites or detections for the Washington Times or for any ‘retired military officer,’ nor did it authorize them to make any such claims or representations,” the company said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “The image analysis that we performed were distributed to a handful of individuals for their private consumption and not for publication.” In the statement to BuzzFeed News, an attorney for XRVision claimed that the firm identified two members of neo-Nazi organizations and a QAnon supporter – not antifa activists – amongst the rioters. The Dispatch Fact Check reported that one of the neo-Nazis identified by XRVision may not be the same man that was pictured during the Capitol riots. Check Your Fact has debunked the claim that Jake Angeli, a shirtless man that was photographed wearing a horned fur hat at the Capitol on Wednesday, is a member of antifa. Angeli is a known QAnon supporter who The Arizona Republic described as a “fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year.” The Washington Times on Thursday removed the article from its website and later published a new version with a correction: “An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that XRVision facial recognition software identified Antifa members among rioters who stormed the Capitol Wednesday. XRVision did not identify any Antifa members. The Washington Times apologizes to XRVision for the error.” When Congress reconvened to certify the Electoral College votes, Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz cited the Washington Times’ initial report while suggesting that members of antifa had infiltrated the Trump supporters who breached the Capitol, the Washington Post reported. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also shared a screen grab of the original Washington Times headline on his verified Facebook page.

Verdict: False There is no record of Pelosi sending the tweet, which appears to be fabricated. Police had not released information about suspects as of Jan. 2, according to a local media outlet.   Fact Check: Pelosi’s house in San Francisco was vandalized on the morning of Jan. 1 with graffiti, and a pig’s head was left in the driveway, according to San Francisco CBS affiliate KPIX 5. She was in Washington, D.C. when the incident took place, the outlet reported. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s Kentucky home was also defaced with graffiti on Jan. 2. The houses were vandalized days after Congress failed to approve increasing the coronavirus stimulus checks to $2,000, according to NBC News.  An image purports to show a Jan. 1 tweet from Pelosi addressing the incident. “What happened to our home was a travesty and a desperate attempt by White Nationalists to bully me,” the alleged tweet reads. “Not only damage to the garage door but someone urinated and stomped all over my poinsettia, cut my water hose and exposed their genitalia to our security camera. This ain’t over.” Check Your Fact, however, found no record of Pelosi tweeting the statement. A search of Pelosi’s verified Twitter account turned up no matches for the tweet. The tweet also isn’t in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi Violating COVID-19 Safety Guidelines For Social Gatherings) Had Pelosi tweeted about “White Nationalists” vandalizing her home, media outlets would have certainly reported on it, yet none have. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told USA Today that the “tweet is fake” and that Pelosi’s office has “made no public comment on this matter.” It does indeed appear to be fabricated. As of Jan. 2, no one had claimed responsibility for the vandalism, and San Francisco police hadn’t released information about suspects in the case, KPIX 5 reported. Trump supporters on Wednesday breached the Capitol building, and some vandalized Pelosi’s office, according to The New York Times.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/meria.rodriguez/posts/10223648250056035,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/report-pelosi-san-francisco-home-vandalized-graffiti-apparent-pigs-head/,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/report-pelosi-san-francisco-home-vandalized-graffiti-apparent-pigs-head/,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/report-pelosi-san-francisco-home-vandalized-graffiti-apparent-pigs-head/,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/report-pelosi-san-francisco-home-vandalized-graffiti-apparent-pigs-head/,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/pelosi-s-mcconnell-s-homes-vandalized-after-congress-fails-approve-n1252669,https://twitter.com/search?q=What%20happened%20to%20our%20home%20(from%3ASpeakerPelosi)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/SpeakerPelosi,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/17/fact-check-viral-image-nancy-pelosi-violating-covid-19-guidelines-social-gatherings/,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=white+nationalists+Pelosi+house+vandalized&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/05/fact-check-fake-tweet-nancy-pelosi-white-nationalists-vandalism/4126358001/,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/report-pelosi-san-francisco-home-vandalized-graffiti-apparent-pigs-head/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/richard-barnett-pelosi.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9befe9feedf4e9dbf8f3fef8f0e2f4eee9fdfaf8efb5f8f4f6",Did Nancy Pelosi Send This Tweet About Her Home Being Vandalized?,,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The photo shows paper waste produced during the process of opening absentee ballots, not shredded ballots, according to a Fulton County spokesperson. A top official with the Georgia secretary of state’s office has previously refuted claims that ballots in Georgia were being shredded. Fact Check:   The screen grab of a tweet containing an image of boxes full of shredded paper started circulating amid the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia. The Associated Press called the races for Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff early Wednesday morning. “Our team is in Georgia,” reads the screen grabbed tweet from Twitter user @AmyCoello. “They took a little walk. They found shredded ballots in Dell boxes. Police came as well. They wanted to confiscate phones with evidence. Here is just the first few photos.” In her tweet, Coello does not identify where in Georgia the allegedly shredded ballots were found. She did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment regarding her claim.  Another version of the claim suggests the shredded ballots were found in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located. BBC News, which debunked the allegation that the photo shows shredded ballots, identified the Georgia World Congress Center in Fulton County as the location where the picture was taken. Fulton County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez told the DCNF in an email that “we have shredded nothing.” (RELATED: Did Georgia’s Fulton County Identify 132,00 ‘Likely Ineligible’ Ballots?) “Absentee ballots come in two envelopes,” explained Corbitt-Dominguez. “Those envelopes must be opened for the ballots to be counted. We have tens of thousands of ballots to open and use envelope opening equipment to do so. As a result of the process of opening thousands of envelopes, paper waste is left behind. That is what was ‘discovered.’ This was explained to the individuals onsite.” In a press conference on Wednesday, Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said that there was “no evidence of any irregularities” in the runoff elections, offering a “tweet that took a picture of shredded paper and said we’re in ‘Georgia’ and here are shredded ballots” as an example of misinformation. He previously said there is “no shredding of ballots going on” in regards to an allegation President Donald Trump made about the presidential election, according to The New York Times. Under Georgia state law, anyone who “willfully destroys or defaces any ballot or willfully delays the delivery of any ballots shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.

Verdict: False The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office and Dominion Voting Systems refuted that an audit of Dominion Voting Systems machines in Nevada showed such an error rate. Clark County said in a statement that the “only 70% number” is the percentage of mail ballots that needed manual signature verification after machines from a different election technology vendor could not verify them.   Fact Check: The election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the subject of multiple dubious claims on social media since Election Day. This particular Facebook post’s allegation about a Nevada audit of Dominion Voting Systems machines showing a 70 percent error rate appears to stem from a Dec. 14 tweet making a similar claim. The tweet attempts to cite a Las Vegas Review-Journal article explaining how ballots in the state are counted and verified, highlighting a specific line in the story.  The line and the article, however, appear to have been misinterpreted. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Clark County election officials said “about 70 percent of ballots are sent to be reviewed by election officials” after those mail ballots were run through a digital scanner. The article does not mention an audit of Dominion Voting Systems machines finding a 70 percent error rate at any point. “The claim about the error rate is 100% false and unsupported by any evidence,” a Dominion Voting Systems spokesperson confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother-In-Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, used Agilis machines to verify mail-in ballot voter signatures, according to the Wall Street Journal and local ABC affiliate KTNV. Mail-in ballots that cannot be read by the machines undergo a manual verification process overseen by a bipartisan election board, the Nevada Independent reported. Agilis machines come from Runbeck Election Services, not Dominion Voting Systems. The county election department’s “pre and post machine audits reflected no problems with Dominion machines,” according to a statement Clark County provided to Check Your Fact. The statement also said that the “only 70% number is the mail ballots whose signature had to be hand-verified, and could not be verified by the Runbeck Agilis (Signature verifying) machine.” A spokesperson for the Nevada secretary of state’s office told Check Your Fact via email the claim is “not accurate,” adding that all post-election audits have been conducted and that there were “zero error rates.” Nevada certified its presidential election results in November, and, according to CNN, its six state electors cast their Electoral College votes for President-elect Joe Biden on Dec. 14. Congress formally certified Biden’s presidential election win early Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo was actually taken at a 2015 anti-terrorism demonstration in Paris.   Fact Check: Thousands of Trump supporters gathered in Washington in the days leading up to Jan. 6, the day Congress convened to count the Electoral College vote and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, CNN reported. Some supporters gathered in crowds on Jan. 5 to protest the election results ahead of the larger rallies on Wednesday. This particular Jan. 5 Facebook post claims to show an image of “the sea of Trump voters in DC as of 2 hrs. ago.” The Facebook user further remarks, “If you think Biden won this election, you are officially wrong.” (RELATED: Did DC Mayor Muriel Bowser Order These Types Of Businesses To Close To ‘Discourage Trump Supporters From Gathering’?)  Through a reverse image search, however, Check Your Fact found the image was not taken at a pro-Trump rally in D.C. The image actually shows a crowd of demonstrators in Paris’ Place de la Republique on Dec. 11, 2015, participating in a march against terrorism, according to its Getty Images caption. Similar footage of the march can also be seen in a video posted on YouTube by ABC News. The march took place after a Jan. 7, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 11 people at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and four hostages at a supermarket, BBC News reported. On Wednesday, Trump supporters breached the Capitol building while members of Congress were convened to count the Electoral College votes, according to the Washington Post.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The man in the horned fur hat is not a member of antifa. He has been identified as a QAnon supporter that has previously attended pro-Trump events and publicly spoken in favor of the president. Fact Check:    Rioters with pro-Trump flags stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as Congress attempted to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump, according to The New York Times. Social media users have been sharing photos of people who breached the Capitol along with claims that they are members of antifa, a loosely tied group of antifascist activists. Many posts focused on a tattooed man wearing a fur hat with horns that was pictured inside the Capitol on Wednesday. The man pictured wearing a fur hat with horns has been identified as Jake Angeli, a known supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to The Arizona Republic. The QAnon conspiracy theory posits that Trump is fighting an underground cabal of Satanic pedophiles and cannibals that control the government and other institutions. Angeli has been a “fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year,” The Arizona Republic reported.  In a May 2020 interview with The Arizona Republic’s BrieAnna J. Frank, Angeli thanked Q and spoke favorably of Trump before criticizing the press. (RELATED: Were Counterfeit Ballots Found At A Warehouse In Fulton Count, Georgia?)  I’m seeing false tweets that Jake Angeli (aka “QAnon Shaman”) who was part of the group that stormed the Capitol and made it into the chamber, is Antifa. He is very much a @realDonaldTrump and QAnon supporter, per my interview with him last year ????@azcentral https://t.co/S8luSxeHiO — BrieAnna J. Frank ???? (@brieannafrank) January 6, 2021  Angeli has appeared at rallies that support Trump and dispute the 2020 presidential election results, according to Newsweek. For instance, he was photographed by Reuters at a “Stop the Steal” rally in front of the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix, Arizona on Nov. 7. Some social media users attempted to point to a cropped photo of Angeli at a Black Lives Matter march in June as evidence for their claims. However, the full photo shows he was carrying a “Q sent me” sign. Brett Lewis, who first shared the photo, told The Associated Press that he saw Angeli disrupting the event. After Lin Wood, a lawyer who has voiced baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud, tweeted photos of Angeli with the claim that he is a member of antifa, a man who identified himself as Angeli refuted it in a tweet.  Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm. I’m a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX.

Verdict: False The ballots in question are legitimate unused emergency ballots that were printed out of caution for the November election, according to the voting system implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state’s office. Georgia state election rules require counties to print a certain percentage of emergency ballots in case they are needed.   Fact Check: In the days leading up to the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, social media users shared an image of over a dozen cardboard boxes alongside claims that a warehouse in Fulton County was filled with counterfeit ballots. The text in this particular Facebook post appears to lift from a tweet thread by former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne that makes the same claim. In a Jan. 4 press conference, Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, addressed the allegation. The ballots photographed in the warehouse were not fake ballots but rather emergency ballots, Sterling said.   “For any of y’all in the press who have been to the Fulton County warehouse, these are the emergency ballots that have been sitting in that warehouse since before the November election, very much in plain view for everybody to see,” Sterling said. Georgia state election rules require counties to print emergency ballots in case they are needed. The “sufficient amount of emergency ballots shall be at least 10% of the number of registered voters in the polling place” for any primary or general election in which a state or federal candidate is on the ballot, according to state election rules. Sterling further explained that the county printed 100% of the ballots it would need to conduct the November election entirely by paper ballot. The county did so out of an abundance of caution after a COVID-19 outbreak at the warehouse occurred before the logic and accuracy testing of voting equipment. The ballots were ultimately not needed because the testing was able to occur, according to Sterling. “They are not fake ballots,” he said. “They are real ballots, they are unused ballots.” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show A Technician Manipulating Voting Data In Georgia) Stephen Fowler, a Georgia Public Broadcasting politics reporter, also debunked the claim on Twitter, saying that they were “emergency backup paper ballots.”  BIG NEWS: You just discovered emergency backup paper ballots, which Georgia law requires counties to have in case the voting machines go down or some other problem occurs.

Verdict: False There was not a Dominion Voting Systems hack during a recent Georgia Senate subcommittee hearing, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office and Dominion Voting Systems. The device in question was a poll pad from KnowInk, an election technology vendor that also refuted claims its equipment was hacked.   Fact Check: The election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of several baseless allegations of election fraud since the November elections, the Washington Post reported. Now, a viral Facebook post claims Dominion Voting Systems was hacked on live TV on Dec. 30. The Facebook user linked in the comments section to an article about CueCat inventor Jovan Pulitzer claiming he accessed Dominion’s system by hacking a poll pad during a Georgia Senate subcommittee hearing held that same day. Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Greene further spread the claim on Twitter, remarking, “Well would you look at that! @JovanHPulitzer was able to hack into Dominion machines because they are connected to the internet. @GaSecofState our #Georgia elections are not safe!”  However, no Dominion Voting Systems machine was hacked during the hearing, according to both the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office and Dominion Voting Systems. (RELATED: Does Brad Raffensperger Have A Brother Who Works For Huawei?) “In his presentation, Hutton Pulitzer, formerly J. Jovan Philylaw, claimed without providing any evidence that he had ‘hacked’ a poll pad,” reads a statement from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office. “He then went on to claim that meant that the entire voting system was compromised even though the poll pad, like the poll books which they have replaced, are never connected to the rest of the voting system.” The Georgia Secretary of State’s Office statement goes on to explain that poll pads, which are different from vote tabulators, are the “only piece of election infrastructure that is ever hooked up to the internet or connected to devices that are hooked up to the internet” so that election workers can “download updated voter lists to the poll pads that are used to check people in on Election Day.” WiFi capability is “disabled before the poll pads are put in to use at the polling place,” according to the statement. Touch screens and printers at polling places are “never attached to the poll pads” and are “air-gapped so that they cannot be connected to the internet,” per the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. Scanners also do not connect to any other equipment. Dominion Voting Systems said on its website that “this is another deliberately inaccurate claim,” noting that the comments at the hearing “actually focused on PollPad electronic check-in devices.” The firm does not make poll pads, and poll pads do not connect to Dominion Voting Systems tabulators, according to its website. As part of its election system, Georgia uses electronic poll books made by election technology vendor KnowInk. In a statement on its website, KnowInk likewise refuted allegations that its equipment was compromised by Pulitzer. (RELATED: Explaining The Viral Video Claiming To Show Election Fraud In Fulton County, Georgia) “The assertions made about unauthorized access to our systems are patently false,” reads the company’s statement. “The man claiming that someone ‘got into’ our systems did not happen according to our forensic analysis. There was no ‘hack,’ there was no ‘back door’ entry, there was no ‘pump and dump,’ and there was no access through a ‘thermostat’ located hundreds of miles away in Savannah.” In KnowInk’s Dec. 31 statement, the company further noted that its “our electronic poll books are not being used for voter check-ins during the early voting process currently underway in Georgia, and they won’t be used until next Tuesday on Election Day.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo actually shows crowds gathered for the Washington Prayer March that took place in September 2020.   Fact Check: Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump traveled to the nation’s capital in the days leading up to Jan. 6, the day of Congress meeting to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, according to USA Today. Some Trump supporters gathered to protest against the presidential election results on Tuesday, ahead of the larger rally that occurred on Wednesday. The Jan. 5 Facebook post attempts to suggest that a photo of large crowds around the Reflecting Pool and at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial depicts a scene in “Washington DC right now!” That is, however, not the case.  Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo in religious news reports about the Washington Prayer March, an event attended by tens of thousands of people on Sept. 26 last year. Christian evangelist Rev. Franklin Graham shared the photo on Sept. 26, 2020, in a tweet related to the Prayer March.  “For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:20) #PrayerMarch2020 #WashingtonDC pic.twitter.com/PH1npj86pS — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) September 27, 2020  Fox News also captured similar images in its live Facebook video coverage of the Washington Prayer March in late September 2020. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Pro-Trump Caravan Driving From California To DC In January?) Graham led prayers at the event, which, according to The Associated Press, was held shortly before Trump was set to announce his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s death. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the Prayer March, Newsweek reported. The Prayer March spanned from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol, according to the Washington Post.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/michelle.pop.146/posts/107235224652691,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/04/electoral-college-certification-republicans-object-joe-biden-win/4042776001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/04/electoral-college-certification-republicans-object-joe-biden-win/4042776001/,https://www.facebook.com/michelle.pop.146/posts/107235224652691,https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/thousands-fill-national-mall-on-day-of-prayer-and-repentance/,https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/prayer-march-2020-gets-surprise-speech-from-vice-president-pence/,https://mychristiandaily.com/christians-overtake-washington-dc-in-march-for-prayer/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/prayer-march-national-mall/2020/09/26/e401f184-002f-11eb-b555-4d71a9254f4b_story.html,https://twitter.com/Franklin_Graham/status/1310038204708532226/photo/1,https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrayerMarch2020?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/hashtag/WashingtonDC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/PH1npj86pS,https://twitter.com/Franklin_Graham/status/1310038204708532226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=721421495075446&id=15704546335,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/05/fact-check-trump-caravan-california-dc-january/,https://apnews.com/article/franklin-graham-us-supreme-court-courts-michael-pence-archive-aba3494516c6bc805be59e936b991c15,https://www.newsweek.com/franklin-graham-pence-lead-prayer-march-thanking-god-trump-scotus-nominee-1534451,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/prayer-march-national-mall/2020/09/26/e401f184-002f-11eb-b555-4d71a9254f4b_story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#34404651425b4674575c51575f4d5b4146525557401a575b59",Does This Photo Show A Massive Crowd On The DC National Mall In Early January 2021?,,,,,,

Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that she is a crisis actor. Fact Check:   The tweet shows screen grabs of two articles about Keenan: one about her receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the other from the Coventry Telegraph about her being the first recipient in the U.K. to get the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial. In both images, Keenan appears to be wearing the same blue shirt and grey cardigan. The Twitter user attempts to use the screen grabs of the two articles to falsely suggest that the retired jewelry store assistant is an actress, saying, “Margaret Keenan, someone please buy this actor some new clothes.” Some media outlets used old photos from Keenan’s first jab as featured images in articles about her second jab, which may have led some to erroneously believe she wore the same clothes for both injections. Photos show that Keenan did, in fact, wear different clothes for her second dose of the vaccine in late December. In Dec. 29 photos available through The Associated Press and Getty Images, Keenan can be seen donning a gray-and-black striped sweater. The University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, the hospital where Keenan was vaccinated, also tweeted a picture of Keenan wearing the gray-and-black sweater.   We were delighted to welcome Margaret Keenan back to University Hospital, Coventry to safely receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccination. The 91-year-old became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine following its clinical approval. pic.twitter.com/AxWtBGeXv9 — UHCW NHS Trust (@nhsuhcw) December 30, 2020  “We were delighted to welcome Margaret Keenan back to University Hospital, Coventry to safely receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccination,” the Dec. 30 tweet reads in part. (RELATED: Viral Post Falsely Claims The First UK COVID-19 Vaccine Recipient Is A Crisis Actor) The two photos of Keenan that appear in the tweet making the false claim were taken while she received her first dose of the vaccine. The photo on the left can be found on Getty Images, where it is captioned: “Margaret Keenan, 90, the first patient in the United Kingdom to receive the Pfizer/BioNtech covid-19 vaccine, speaks with Healthcare assistant Lorraine Hill as she prepares to leave University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire, the day after receiving the first of two doses of the vaccine, on December 9, 2020.” The other photo, credited to PA Media’s Jacob King by the Coventry Telegraph, also shows Keenan as she receives the first dose in early December. Check Your Fact previously debunked the claim that Keenan is a crisis actor. Keenan has been the target of several baseless rumors since receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine shot in early December, according to Vice.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False   The image, which dates back to October 2020, shows a pro-Trump truck rally held in Northern California. Fact Check: Over the weekend, Facebook users shared the photo of vehicles sporting pro-Trump flags along with captions suggesting it depicts supporters of President Donald Trump traveling to D.C. to participate in planned Jan. 6 protests against the presidential election results. Congress is set to meet on Jan. 6 to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, according The Associated Press.  One Facebook user sharing the picture wrote, “These great patriots are heading to DC to support our President Trump on January 6,” while another said, “On their way to D.C. for Jan. 6th; the Army of the Lord coming!” Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image dates back to October 2020, when it was published in an Oct. 24 article by the Bay area radio station KCBS Radio. On Oct. 24, 2020, Trump supporters participated in a truck rally in Pleasanton, California, KCBS Radio reported. The photo’s caption in the article credits it to KCBS Radio’s Matt Boone. Visible in the picture is a street sign for Stonebridge Mall Road, which is located in Pleasanton, according to Google Maps.

Verdict: False Joe Biden has not stepped down as president-elect. The claim first appeared on a prank website.   Fact Check: Social media platforms are replete with misinformation about Biden, with many dubious claims starting to circulate after he received enough Electoral College votes to secure the presidency. This particular Facebook post shares what appears to be a screen grab of a Jan. 1 article from a Fox News affiliate in Atlanta, Georgia. The headline of the alleged article reads, “President Elect Biden steps down as President Elect.”  “Newly President Elect Joe Biden has resigned as President elect after consulting with his family & legal team due to an unspecified health issue,” the supposed article’s text reads. “President elect Biden’s advisors and legal team will make an official announcement tonight at 9pm ET. FOX will be following any new information and will keep you informed for the latest.” There is, however, no evidence that Biden has decided to step down as president-elect due to a health condition. No press release to that effect could be found on Biden’s presidential transition website. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother-In-Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) Check Your Fact also searched both the Fox News website and the Fox 5 Atlanta website, but found no articles claiming Biden stepped down from his position. Major media outlets have not reported on Biden’s purported resignation either, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. The image appears to actually be a screen grab of the mobile version of an article published on the self-described prank website Channel 22 News. The website, which allows users to create their own prank news stories, includes disclaimers of its satirical nature, including text next to the article that reads, “You’ve Been Pranked!” The Facebook post fails to include such a disclaimer, a common way for misinformation to spread. Congress is scheduled to formally count and certify the 2020 Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, according to USA Today.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/UndergroundPatriot/posts/214942180183958,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/23/fact-check-joe-biden-nominate-charlotte-clymer-secretary-education/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/07/fact-check-joe-biden-walking-boot-left-right-wrong-foot-major-dog/,https://www.facebook.com/UndergroundPatriot/posts/214942180183958,https://buildbackbetter.gov/category/press-releases/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/22/fact-check-joe-bidens-brother-in-law-own-dominion-voting-systems/,https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=Biden%20resigns%20as%20president%20elect,https://www.fox5atlanta.com/search?q=Biden%20resigns%20as%20president%20elect&ss=fb,https://www.google.com/search?q=Biden+stepped+down+as+president+elect&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPs5jyu4XuAhWstlkKHc9NCXgQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&cshid=1609872903025067&biw=1920&bih=897,https://channel22news.com/president-elect-biden-steps-down-as-president-elect/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/01/congress-count-electoral-votes-jan-6-formalizing-bidens-win/4086513001/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#681c1a0d1e071a280b000d0b0311071d1a0e090b1c460b0705","No, Joe Biden Has Not Resigned As President-Elect",,,,,,

Fact Check: The image shows what appears to be dozens of cars, many outfitted with American and pro-Trump flags, driving in a procession along a wooded highway. “Just seen this on Twitter!” reads the Jan. 3 post’s caption. “This Caravan is headed to DC from California RIGHT NOW!” Thousands of Trump supporters are expected to attend a Jan. 6 rally in the nation’s capital to protest against the 2020 presidential election results, the same day Congress is set to certify the Electoral College votes, according to local news stations.

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False This list does not reflect actual accomplishments of Biden, as he never served in the military, did not go to Harvard Law School and was too young to be involved in the creation of organizations such as NASA and the Peace Corps. Fact Check:   The Associated Press projected on Nov. 7 that Biden had won the 2020 presidential election. In the weeks since, social media has become replete with inaccurate claims about the president-elect. “Joe Biden was a war hero,” this particular Facebook post alleges. “He rescued his whole regiment and capture 3000 enemy soldiers. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery. He was a Rhodes Scholar , graduating top of his Harvard Law School Class and went on to build a multi million dollar law firm in Boston. He then ran for Congress and was instrumental in creating NASA, the Peace CORP, The Dept. of Homeland Security and passed 11 balanced budgets.” Contrary to the post’s claims, Biden did not serve in the military, making the first three claims of the post – that he was a war hero, captured 3,000 enemy soldiers and received the Medal of Honor – impossible. A search of the Medal of Honor database turns up no matches for Biden’s name. Biden received five student draft deferments during the Vietnam War before receiving a medical exemption in 1968, USA Today reported.  Biden received his law degree from Syracuse University, where he ranked 76th out of 85th in his class, according to The Washington Post. The Rhodes Scholar database does not list Biden as a recipient of the award. Biden did found a law firm, formerly known as Biden and Walsh, but it was in Delaware, Fox News reported. NASA was founded in 1958, according to the organization’s website, while the Peace Corps was created in 1961 by John F. Kennedy, according to its website. Biden was born in November 1942, meaning he was a teenager at the time of the organizations’ respective starts. Biden was elected to Congress in 1972 and served until 2009, when he was elected vice president. Though he was in office when Congress passed the Homeland Security Act — which created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 — he was not a sponsor of the act. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother In Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) The Facebook post further claims Biden passed a balanced budget 11 times during his time in Congress, but that does not hold up either. Historical budget data from the Congressional Budget Office shows there was a total surplus for four fiscal years while Biden served in Congress: 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Discounting Social Security for those four years still leaves an “on-budget” surplus for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, according to the data. In some iterations of the image, there is additional text at the bottom that acknowledges “NONE of this is true.” It reads in part, “I made it all up.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The order, effective Dec. 23 to Jan. 15, is intended to limit the spread of COVID-19.   Fact Check: Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump are expected to gather in the nation’s capital on Jan. 6 to protest against the 2020 presidential election results, according to local news stations. On Jan. 6, Congress is set to meet to count the Electoral College votes and finalize President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over Trump, The Associated Press reported. Viral social media posts suggest that Bowser, the Democratic mayor of D.C., has “orded (sic) all hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and convenience stores to close jan. 4th, 5th and 6th to Discourage TRUMP supporters from gathering in DC.” Some posts go on to urge those attending the demonstrations to bring their own supplies.  Bowser on Dec. 18 issued an executive order to close indoor dining, museums and libraries from Dec. 23. to Jan. 15 to help “flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases,” not to discourage protesters. In D.C., there have been over 29,900 positive COVID-19 cases and nearly 800 deaths from the disease as of Jan. 3, according to data on the district’s coronavirus website. While one hotel and pub announced they would voluntarily close ahead of Jan. 6, the executive order, which is available online, makes no mention of closing all restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, convenience stores or gas stations. (RELATED: Donald Trump Claims DC Mayor ‘Wouldn’t Let The DC Police Get Involved’ With May 29 White House Protest) Under the order, restaurants are still allowed to offer outdoor dining, carryout and delivery. Grocery stores, convenience stores and gas stations are considered essential businesses and have remained open in D.C. A search on Hotels.com also reveals numerous hotels in the D.C. area still taking reservations for the dates mentioned in the Facebook post. Bowser did ask in a Jan. 3 tweet for residents to stay away from the downtown area on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6.  I am asking Washingtonians and those who live in the region to stay out of the downtown area on Tuesday and Wednesday and not to engage with demonstrators who come to our city seeking confrontation, and we will do what we must to ensure all who attend remain peaceful. — Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) January 3, 2021   “I am asking Washingtonians and those who live in the region to stay out of the downtown area on Tuesday and Wednesday and not to engage with demonstrators who come to our city seeking confrontation, and we will do what we must to ensure all who attend remain peaceful,” she tweeted. The D.C. National Guard on Monday released a statement announcing that approximately 340 guardsmen have been activated to assist law enforcement ahead of the week’s anticipated demonstrations. The guardsmen will be activated from Jan. 5 to 7, according to the D.C. National Guard’s statement.

Microsoft acquires Sony… wth just happened! — Harish Vaidyanathan (@harishv) December 29, 2020    Microsoft acquires Sony! History re-written ???? — Kunall Gupta (@prioritizer01) December 29, 2020  Verdict: False   There is no evidence that Microsoft acquired Sony. The claim appears to have originated as a joke. Fact Check: The rumor that Microsoft has acquired its competitor Sony has been spreading on Facebook and Twitter in recent days.  For instance, a Twitter user commented, “Microsoft acquires Sony… wth just happened,” while one Facebook account shared a screen grab of what appears to be a news article reporting on the supposed acquisition of Sony “with all its divisions, including PlayStation.”  Sony Corporation has multiple divisions including gaming, electronics, music and entertainment, according to its website. Both it and Microsoft are prominent players in the gaming sphere, where Microsoft produces the Xbox gaming platform and Sony produces the PlayStation. Both companies recently released new gaming consoles, according to NPR. (RELATED: Has Anthony Fauci Ever Sat On Miscrosoft’s Board?) There is, however, no evidence the acquisition occurred. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find a press release announcing a move to that effect on either company’s website. Microsoft and Sony are also both global companies that, according to Forbes, pull in billions of dollars in profit, and if one were to acquire the other, it would certainly be covered by major news outlets, yet none have. Mergers between two large companies often take months or even years to complete and sometimes require approvals from numerous government agencies. For example, mobile carrier T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint took about two years to finalize, according to NPR. The inaccurate claim appears to have originated with a Spanish-language article published by the website Microsofters on Dec. 28. The article was then translated into English and published on the website En24 News. Both posts claim that Microsoft acquired Sony for $130 billion, though Sony was estimated to have a market value of $78.7 billion in May 2020 by Forbes. The En24 News post is a near-identical translated copy of the Microsofters post but fails to include the last line in the original Spanish-language article that reads, “Feliz Día de los Inocentes!” The Day of the Holy Innocents is Mexico’s equivalent to April Fool’s Day, according to Mexico News Daily. That line would appear to indicate that the original Microsofters story was written in jest.

The statement was actually made by Powell’s former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson.   Fact Check: Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding his communications with a former Russian ambassador but later sought to withdraw the plea, Reuters reported. Trump pardoned him in November, according to The New York Times. A Dec. 23 post on Facebook claims Powell, a former national security advisor and secretary of state, said that if he was the secretary of defense, he would call Flynn “back to active duty” and “court martial him.” (RELATED: Is This Statement A Real Trump Campaign Announcement About A Separate Inauguration At Mar-A-Lago?)  An internet search of the quote, however, showed no instances of Powell saying the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his Facebook posts also turned up no matches for the statement. Powell does not appear to have an active verified Twitter account. Powell’s former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, was actually the one who made the comment during a Dec. 21 appearance on MSNBC’s program “All In with Chris Hayes.” He also referred to Flynn as “a disgrace to the uniform” during the interview. Wilkerson’s comments appear to be in response to statements Flynn made during a Dec. 17 interview on Newsmax TV’s “Greg Kelly Reports.” Flynn falsely claimed during the interview that President Donald Trump won the presidential election and suggested that Trump could use military capabilities to “basically re-run” the election in swing states. Claims that Powell made the statement may have originated with a Dec. 23 article from the Palmer Report, originally titled “General Colin Powell drops the hammer on Michael Flynn,” that initially claimed Powell was urging the military to try Flynn for sedition. The article was later updated to reflect that those comments came from Wilkerson, not Powell.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/bob.brown2/posts/10224873092512525,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-flynn/trump-pardons-former-adviser-flynn-who-pleaded-guilty-in-russia-probe-idUSKBN28536B,https://www.justice.gov/pardon/page/file/1341606/download,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/politics/michael-flynn-pardon.html,https://www.facebook.com/bob.brown2/posts/10224873092512525,https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/powell-colin-luther,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/18/fact-check-trump-campaign-inauguration-mar-a-lago/,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Powell+%22I%27d+court+martial+him%22+Flynn&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8,https://www.facebook.com/page/128391476718/search/?q=I%27d%20court%20martial%20him,https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-disgrace-to-his-uniform-col-wilkerson-on-flynn-s-martial-law-election-plot-98216517703,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/trump-election-flynn-martiallaw/2020/12/17/id/1002139/,https://web.archive.org/web/20201224052224/https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/general-colin-powell-drops-the-hammer-on-michael-flynn/35002/,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/general-colin-powell-drops-the-hammer-on-michael-flynn/35002/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#71050314071e0331121914121a081e0403171012055f121e1c","Did Colin Powell Say That If He Was The Defense Secretary, He Would Court-Martial Michael Flynn?",,,,,,

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False The FBI published photos of Warner on Twitter. Warner and the man pictured are different people that do not closely resemble each other. Fact Check:   An explosion emanating from a parked RV rocked Nashville, Tennessee, on the morning of Dec. 25, injuring at least eight and killing Warner, the suspected perpetrator, CNN reported. Authorities identified Warner as the lone individual suspected to be behind the bombing by matching DNA at the scene to DNA found at another location investigators searched, according to The Associated Press. As federal, state and local law enforcement continue to investigate the motive behind the blast, some social media users have shared a photo that they claim shows Warner wearing a “Trump 2020: Make Liberals Cry Again” hat. The pictured man, however, is not Warner. (RELATED: Was The Nashville Explosion Caused By A Missile Strike?) The FBI’s Memphis office released two photos of the suspected bomber on its Twitter account in the days following the explosion.

The man, who has a similar name to the suspected bomber, posted the picture to his Facebook account months before the Christmas Day explosion. The DCNF anonymized the man in the image and will not include his name in the article due to privacy concerns. The motive behind the bombing is still under investigation. Media reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether Warner believed in conspiracy theories, including those involving 5G technology and “lizard people.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False Brad Raffensperger and the Ron Raffensperger pictured are not brothers. While Brad Raffensperger does have one brother, his name is not Ron, the Georgia Secretary of State’s office confirmed. Fact Check:    The post features photos of two people: Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state for Georgia, and Ron Raffensperger, the chief technology officer of Huawei Enterprise Storage Solutions. It uses a yellow arrow to falsely claim the two men pictured are brothers, seemingly in an attempt to suggest a relationship between the Georgia secretary of state and Huawei, a Chinese company that, according to Reuters, was placed on the U.S.’s entity list due to national security concerns in May 2019. Brad Raffensperger has three sisters and a brother, none of whom is named Ron, according to a 2018 family obituary and Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB). The Georgia Secretary of State’s office confirmed to Check Your Fact in a text message that Brad Raffensperger does not have a brother named Ron. Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs also told CNN that “there are no relatives who work for China or are affiliated with China.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Two Georgia State Senators Found Counting Ballots?) The inaccurate claim about Brad Raffensperger and Ron Raffensperger being brothers appears to have stemmed from them coincidentally having the same last name. Gateway Pundit published an now-unavailable article making the false claim on Dec. 22. President Donald Trump on Dec. 29 also tweeted a similar claim, writing, “Now it turns out that Brad R’s brother works for China.”  Following Trump’s tweet, some news outlets and journalists initially erroneously reported that Brad Raffensperger didn’t have a brother at all. Newsweek and The Daily Beast, for instance, later updated their articles, and journalists such as CNN’s Daniel Dale and GPB’s Stephen Fowler also made clarifications on Twitter.  IMPORTANT UPDATE: Georgia’s Secretary of State does have a brother – who is a private citizen and not discussed much. He’s also got sisters. None of them are named Ron, work for China or have to do with voting machine vendors. More details below. #gapolhttps://t.co/ucUmXJ7xCj — stephen fowler covers Georgia’s election!

Adam Schiff was recently arrested at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  Verdict: False The Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association tweeted that the Los Angeles Airport Police Department and Los Angeles Police Department have no record of Schiff being arrested at LAX. A spokesperson for Schiff has also refuted the claim. Fact Check: An image on Facebook shares hyperlinks to two Dec. 24 tweets claiming Schiff was arrested at LAX, as well as a website allegedly showing his arrest record. “I’m currently at Los Angeles international Airport (LAX) and Congressman Adam Schiff was just being escorted back out of a terminal with about 15 LAPD/Airport police!?” one of the tweets reads. The account which sent the tweets has since been suspended.   There is, however, no evidence that Schiff was arrested in LAX on Dec. 24. Had the congressman been arrested at the airport, major media outlets would have covered it, yet none have. A search of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Inmate Information Center likewise did not show any record of his arrest. John Satterfield, the deputy sheriff for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that “the Sheriff’s Information Bureau is unaware of any recent law enforcement contact at LAX involving the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and U.S. Representative Adam Schiff.” When asked to comment on the claim, a spokesperson for Schiff directed Check Your Fact to a fact-check article published by USA Today where a spokesperson confirmed that Schiff was not arrested.  In addition, a spokesperson for the FBI’s Los Angeles office told Law & Crime, a media outlet focused on reporting arrests and criminal trials, that she was “unaware of such an arrest by the FBI.” A representative of the Los Angeles Media Division Department told Check Your Fact that the Los Angeles Airport Police would have more information in regards to any law enforcement actions at LAX. The Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association also said in a tweet that there is “no record” of Schiff’s arrest. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Adam Schiff Will Be Charged With ‘Presidential Harassment’) “Seems like another #PizzaGate,” the tweet reads. “No record of @RepAdamSchiff being arrested at @flyLAXairport by @LAAirportPD or  @LAPDHQ. The picture you posted is not the official @LASDHQ Inmate Information Center website.

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False AAA is not offering its “Tipsy Tow” service this year in order to comply with COVID-19 social distancing recommendations, according to a AAA spokesperson. Fact Check:   As the end of 2020 approaches, social media users have been sharing images urging people to use AAA’s “Tipsy Tow” service for this New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. AAA has provided intoxicated people in participating areas a tow and safe ride home from New Year celebrations in previous years. “No excuses. Don’t drink and drive- and don’t ride with anybody who does,” a Dec. 28 version of the image reads. “Tipsy Tow offered by AAA: You don’t have to be a AAA member, from 6pm-6am on New Year’s Eve/Day they will take your drunk self and your car home for FREE. Save this number 1-800-222-4357. RT to save a life.” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Boston Police Vandalizing Their Vehicle To ‘Blame It On The Protesters’) The same information appeared in a now-deleted Dec. 29, 2017 tweet that can be seen in a Facebook post shared on New Year’s Eve that year. That Dec. 31, 2017 post recently started recirculating on Facebook, which appears to have made some users mistakenly think the service is being offered this year. AAA spokesperson Ellen Edmonds told Check Your Fact via email that “Tipsy Tow will not be offered in any state this year” for Dec. 31 or Jan. 1 celebrations.  “For the protection of our members and our service providers, AAA is not allowing passengers to ride in our tow trucks to ensure compliance with social distancing recommendations provided by the CDC,”  Edmonds explained. “AAA urges anyone who is planning to drive, not to drink. And when drinking, always designate a sober driver or arrange for alternative transportation to get home safely.” The American Safety Council website offers “Drunk Driving Avoidance Tips For New Years” such as having a designated driver, taking a taxi or staying over at the host’s house.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jason.chesnutt.3/posts/10157647267081475,https://www.facebook.com/jason.chesnutt.3/posts/10157647267081475,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/deals-shopping/fl-bz-aaa-tipsy-tow-service-new-years-eve-20191230-7wpzabbw7bcgtl3f75hdbj4wa4-story.html,https://archive.is/8tjDj#selection-769.115-769.299,https://www.facebook.com/jason.chesnutt.3/posts/10157647267081475,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/10/fact-check-video-boston-police-vandalizing-vehicle-blame-protesters/,https://twitter.com/jessssicaxlyn/status/946913594158882816,https://www.facebook.com/katherine.palaeologus/posts/10211976247907744,https://blog.americansafetycouncil.com/drunk-driving-avoidance-tips-for-new-years-2/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4b4d5a49504d7f5c575a5c5446504a4d595e5c4b115c5052",Is AAA Offering Free ‘Tipsy Tow’ Service This Upcoming New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day?,,,,,,

Oswald has refuted the attribution.   Fact Check: The post features a lengthy statement in which Oswald, a professor of molecular medicine at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, allegedly suggests that COVID-19 is a “hoax.” Accompanying the purported quote is a screen grab of Oswald’s faculty profile on Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine website. “I have a PhD in virology and immunology. I’m a clinical lab scientist and have tested 1500 ‘supposed’ positive Covid 19 samples collected here in S. California,” the Facebook post credits Oswald with saying in part. “When my lab team and I did the testing through Koch’s postulates and observation under a SEM (scanning electron microscope), we found NO Covid in any of the 1500 samples. What we found was that all of the 1500 samples were mostly Influenza A and some were influenza B, but not a single case of Covid, and we did not use the B.S. PCR test.”  While the attribution to Oswald may seem legitimate at first glance, it doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. The quote contains inaccurate biographical information such as saying Oswald has a “PhD in virology and immunology” when, according to his faculty page, he actually has a doctorate in biochemistry. The professor also has a statement on his faculty page that contradicts the message in the Facebook post. “COVID-19 is real. Any Facebook post that suggests otherwise is a hoax and is not true,” reads the statement on his faculty page. “Wear a mask, practice social distancing, and get the vaccine when it becomes available.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Mike Pence Being Vaccinated For COVID-19 With The Cap On The Needle?) Oswald refuted the attribution in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation, saying, “This is a hoax that has been sent out under various names. None of it is true and I had nothing to do with it.” Indeed, an internet search reveals the message has previously circulated online without attribution to Oswald. COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus that causes it are real, despite what the Facebook post alleges in its misattributed quote. The novel coronavirus, which has had its genome fully isolated by researchers, has sickened over 19.2 million people and killed over 332,000 in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The photo behind the fabricated chyron comes from a New York Times opinion article about treating gunshot victims   Fact Check: COVID-19 vaccines began being distributed to health care workers in the U.S. Dec. 14, the Washington Post reported. More than 2 million people have already received the first dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An image on Facebook shares what appears to be a screen grab of a live news broadcast from CNN showing an emergency room in disarray along with a chyron reading, “Breaking News: Hospitals On Lockdown As First COVID Vaccine Patients Start Eating Other Patients.”  There is no record, however, of CNN ever broadcasting such a chyron. A search of CNN’s website turned up no news reports of people who received a COVID-19 vaccine “eating other patients.” There is likewise no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine causes cannibalism as a side effect. Had a hospital seen such a side effect in its vaccine recipients, it would certainly have been covered by media outlets, yet none have. A reverse image search of the alleged screen grab reveals that the photo of the emergency room actually originates from a New York Times opinion piece written by Eric Curran about his experience treating gunshot wound victims. Curran also took the photos used in the article. “The trauma bay in the emergency department at Temple University Hospital after resuscitation efforts failed,” reads the original photo’s caption.

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False Check Your Fact didn’t find any record of 14 generals making such a statement. The claim appears to have originated from a satirical article. Fact Check:   Misinformation related to Biden and his incoming administration has circulated online since he became president-elect. This particular Facebook post alleges that “14 generals say they will never take orders from Joe Biden.” (RELATED: Did A Prague Newspaper Publish An Article Calling Joe Biden Supporters Fools?) However, Check Your Fact didn’t find any record of 14 U.S. generals making such a public statement. Had so many generals publicly expressed the sentiment, it likely would have been covered by media outlets, yet none appear to have done so except to debunk the claim. Media outlets such as the Military Times, Stars and Stripes, and Task and Purpose have not published articles reporting on it, for instance. The text in the Facebook post minus the word “boom” matches the headline of an article published on the Daily World Update, a satirical news website that states on its “about” page that “everything on this website is fiction.” The Daily World Update article, which was published in November, has been shared widely across Facebook in recent days, CrowdTangle data shows.  This isn’t the first time social media users have shared claims that stemmed from satire articles without disclaiming the satirical origins. In August, Check Your Fact debunked an image alleging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would resign if President Donald Trump won reelection. That claim originated from Bustatroll.org, another known satire website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/hdvmia/posts/4583997301637663,https://www.facebook.com/hdvmia/posts/4583997301637663,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/23/fact-check-prague-newspaper-article-joe-biden-supporters-fools/,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/12/fact-check-14-generals-did-not-say-they-will-never-take-orders-from-joe-biden.html,https://www.militarytimes.com/search/61890286/?q=14+general+biden,https://www.stripes.com/search-7.269?q=14+generals+Biden,https://taskandpurpose.com/search/14+generals+biden,https://dailyworldupdate.us/14-generals-say-they-will-never-take-orders-from-joe-biden/,https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/,https://apps.crowdtangle.com/search/results?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyworldupdate.us%2F14-generals-say-they-will-never-take-orders-from-joe-biden%2F&platform=facebook&sortBy=date&sortOrder=desc,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/08/27/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-resign-donald-trump-elected/,https://bustatroll.org/2020/04/10/resign-nancy-resign/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1b5b3a4b7aeb381a2a9a4a2aab8aeb4b3a7a0a2b5efa2aeac",Did 14 Generals Say They Will Never Take Orders From Joe Biden?,,,,,,

Video released by police shows the blast was caused by a bomb that detonated inside an RV. Fact Check: An explosion rattled downtown Nashville on Christmas morning, injuring several people and damaging dozens of buildings, according to the Tennessean. The blast came from a bomb inside an RV parked near an AT&T transmission building on Second Avenue North, the outlet reported.  Multiple Twitter users have since shared screen grabs and clips from surveillance footage of the explosion, pointing to what appears to be a smoke trail to claim the blast was caused by a missile. The origin of the footage shown in the tweets appears to be a video clip, titled “Nashville Explosion Caught on Tape (Second Angle)” and posted on YouTube by Nexstar Media Group director of digital content Austin Kellerman, that was obtained from a local business by the news station WKRN-TV. In the surveillance video posted by Kellerman, the trail of smoke appears to ascend from rather than descend toward the explosion. The narrator of the video also notes the path of the smoke trail, saying, “Watch by the third light post, something streams up in the air” before the explosion is seen. When asked if video footage shows a missile strike, Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told Check Your Fact in an email, “No, it does not. Missiles don’t leave a trail of smoke when they re-enter.” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show A Missile Striking Beirut) The Metro Nashville Police Department also tweeted footage from one of its cameras at the corner of Second Avenue North and Commerce Street that captured the moment of the RV’s detonation. In the police footage, no missile can be seen prior to the explosion.

A motive for the bombing has not been announced. This isn’t the first time social media users have made false claims related to the Nashville explosion. Check Your Fact previously debunked posts that attempted to link the bombing to the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems by alleging AT&T got a contract to audit voting machines from the company.

Fact Check: Dominion Voting Systems has been the subject of baseless conspiracy theories since the 2020 presidential election. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden’s Brother-In-Law Own Dominion Voting Systems?) Facebook and Twitter users are now attempting to link the bombing that rocked Nashville early Christmas morning to the election technology firm’s voting machines. The blast, which injured several people and damaged numerous downtown Nashville businesses, came from an RV parked near an AT&T transmission building on Second Avenue, local news station WKRN reported.  One such Twitter account alleged, “AT&T got a contract to do forensic audit on Dominion voting machines and those machines were being moved to Nashville this past week,” while a Facebook user wrote, “AT&T was awarded a contract to audit Dominion voting machines. Guess what building the RV was parked in front of yesterday in Nashville… #GetReady.” There is, however, no indication AT&T got a contract to audit Dominion Voting System machines. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any national or local media reports about AT&T being awarded such a contract. Representatives from the companies have also refuted the viral claim. “This is not true,” said Jim Greer, assistant vice president of corporate communications at AT&T, in an email to the DCNF. “Dominion and AT&T have both called on the media and the public to reject the baseless rumors circulating on social media, which suggest without evidence that there was some election-related connection to the Nashville explosion,” a spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems told the DCNF via email. “Americans should continue to seek information from verifiable, trusted sources, such as law enforcement authorities.” Don Cochran, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, identified 63-year-old Anthony Q. Warner as the lone suspected individual behind the Nashville bombing on Christmas morning, The Tennessean reported. Warner was “present when the bomb went off, and he perished in the bombing,” Cochran said, according to the outlet. Federal, state and local law enforcement officials so far have not announced the motive behind the bombing, but there is currently no indication it was related to Dominion Voting Systems. Some media reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether Warner had paranoia about 5G, a type of mobile network that is often the subject of online conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Verdict: False Members of Congress did not receive pay raises through the package. The bill also blocked an automatic “cost of living adjustment” which would have automatically taken effect Jan. 1.   Fact Check: Both chambers of Congress on Dec. 21 passed a $2.3 trillion COVID-19 aid and government spending package that paired $900 billion in pandemic relief with $1.4 trillion in government funding, according to CBS News. Trump on Sunday signed the legislation, which included $600 direct payments to adults making up to $75,000, but asked Congress to vote on replacing the $600 payments for adults with $2,000 payments, the outlet reported.

You get $600; THEY get $57,471.” Other iterations of the claim allege the pay raise for Congress members is $40,000.  A search of the bill’s text, however, does not show any mention of a $57,471 or $40,000 pay raise for members of Congress. Furthermore, the legislation expressly states that “no adjustment” will be made for Congress’s pay through a cost-of-living adjustment. Evan Hollander, the communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that Congress “did not give themselves a pay raise in the bill,” but rather “blocked an automatic cost of living adjustment” which would have gone into effect Jan. 1. In accordance with the 1989 Ethics Reform Act, congressional salaries adjustments are automatic and based on changes in private sector wages, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied, Check Your Fact previously reported. Congress has voted against pay increases since 2009, when they first instituted a pay freeze, according to Politico. Check Your Fact previously debunked a similar claim in March that falsely stated the CARES Act provided a $25 million raise to Congress. The House voted on Monday in favor of increasing the $600 economic stimulus payments to $2,000 checks, according to CNBC.

An amendment to modify the Insurrection Act was introduced to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, but the provision was not included in the version sent to President Donald Trump’s desk earlier this month.   Fact Check: Trump on Sunday signed into law a $2.3 trillion COVID-19 aid and government spending package, the White House announced. The legislation, which pairs $900 billion in pandemic relief with $1.4 trillion in government funding, had been passed by both chambers of Congress on Dec. 21, CBS News reported. Facebook and Instagram users have been claiming Congress included in the package some language that “nullifies Trump’s use of the Insurrection Act.” The claim has also spread on Twitter, where former Florida congressional candidate Chuck Callesto included in a now-unavailable tweet an image that he suggested shows the “hidden” provision. The Insurrection Act, which has been amended several times since 1807, gives the president the power to deploy the military within the U.S. to maintain order in some circumstances, according to NPR.  There is no provision about the Insurrection Act in COVID-19 stimulus and government spending bill. Check Your Fact searched the 5,593-page bill and didn’t find a single mention of the Insurrection Act in it. The image Callesto and other social media users shared along with the claim comes from the GovTrack page for an amendment Democratic Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar introduced to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA), a bill shorter than the coronavirus aid and government spending package. Escobar’s amendment to the NDAA sought to “require certifications be made to Congress when the President deploys active duty military within the United States during civil unrest by amending the Insurrection Act in Title 10, Chapter 13 of U.S. Code,” according to its description on Congress.gov. The House passed Escobar’s amendment in July. However, the provision did not appear in the version of the NDAA sent to Trump’s desk, according to the text of the legislation and The Hill. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet That He Has ‘Declared Martial Law’?) Trump vetoed the NDAA on Dec. 23, saying in his announcement that it “fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military’s history, and contradicts efforts by my Administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions.” The House is set to vote Monday on overriding Trump’s veto, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Verdict: False The video has been circulating online since at least July 2019. It appears to show a solar eclipse, not the recent “great conjunction.”   Fact Check: The two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, appeared closer together in the night sky of Dec. 21 than they have since the 17th century, CBS News reported. Though conjunctions between the two planets happen every 20 years, this celestial event, known as the “great conjunction,” was particularly close, with Jupiter and Saturn being one-tenth of a degree apart from an earthbound perspective, according to the outlet. Some social media users have been sharing a video that they claim shows the “Great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn from the sky of Chile.” In the video, people on a beach watch the sky suddenly get darker as an object appears to move in front of the light source. (RELATED: Did NASA Spend More Than $165 Million To Develop Pens That Work In Space?)  The video, however, does not depict the recent “great conjunction” between Jupiter and Saturn. Check Your Fact found that the video has been circulating online since at least July 2019, when it was posted on the website FlyHeight with the title “A Total Sun Eclipse In Northern Chile!” Facebook and Twitter users shared the video in July 2019 as well, similarly describing it as a solar eclipse in the captions. On July 2, 2019, a total solar eclipse was visible across parts of Chile and Argentina, according to CNN. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and Sun, casting a shadow over Earth, according to Space.com. Footage of people watching the July 2019 eclipse on a beach in Chile can be found on YouTube. Photos of the Dec. 21 conjunction do not closely resemble those taken during the July 2019 solar eclipse.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/agnes.andronidou/videos/2744972042429359,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/solar-system/saturn/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jupiter-saturn-great-conjunction-photos/,https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-great-conjunction-of-jupiter-and-saturn,https://www.facebook.com/agnes.andronidou/videos/2744972042429359,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/25/fact-check-nasa-165-million-develop-space-pens-fisher/,https://flyheight.com/videos/0okvsy/,https://www.facebook.com/194865473931118/videos/600756303779999/,https://twitter.com/HumGBtoday/status/1146419816758222848,https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2019Jul02Tgoogle.html,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/americas/photos-solar-eclipse-intl/index.html,https://www.space.com/15584-solar-eclipses.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agJFI4OTCEU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_hsZcVlgE,https://www.newsweek.com/photos-great-conjunction-jupiter-saturn-making-christmas-star-1556599,https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/07/photos-2019-total-solar-eclipse/593275/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8df9ffe8fbe2ffcdeee5e8eee6f4e2f8ffebeceef9a3eee2e0",Does This Video Show The Recent ‘Great Conjunction’ Of Jupiter And Saturn?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The image, taken in 2015, shows Trudeau celebrating Diwali at the Gurdwara Sahib Ottawa Sikh Society, not participating in a protest.   Fact Check: Tens of thousands of farmers in India have been protesting agriculture laws passed in September that they believe will be detrimental to their livelihoods, The Atlantic reported. Trudeau has previously voiced his support of the protesters, saying, “We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns,” CBC News reported. An image on Facebook shows Trudeau sitting on the floor with a group of people from the Indo-Canadian community. A translation of the post reads, “Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sits on protest against anti-farmer black law with Indians in Canada.” (RELATED: Does The US Have A Trade Deficit With Canada?)  Through a reverse image search, however, Check Your Fact found that the image was used in a November 2015 article published in the Hindustan Times. Trudeau celebrated Diwali, a major Hindu holiday, with members of Canada’s Indo-Canadian community at a Hindu temple and a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, according to the article. The image, taken by Patrick Doyle for Reuters in 2015, shows Trudeau as he “listens to speeches at the Gurdwara Sahib Ottawa Sikh Society in Ottawa, Canada, November 11, 2015,” according to the image’s description on Doyle’s website. It can also be found on Alamy with a similar caption. Had Trudeau participated in a protest against the new agricultural laws in India, media outlets would have covered it, yet none have done so. The Indian government previously responded negatively to Trudeau’s support of Indian farmers protesting, calling his remarks “ill-informed” and saying his comments may have “a seriously damaging impact on ties between India and Canada,” according to CBC News.        share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Biden announced Connecticut Education Commissioner Dr. Miguel Cardona as his education secretary nominee. There is no indication he ever chose Clymer for the position.   Fact Check: Featured in the post is an image of Clymer, an Army veteran and LGBTQ rights advocate, speaking with Biden. Text above the image reads in part, “Meet Biden’s pick for U.S. Secretary of Education, Charlotte Clymer.” (RELATED: Did Betsy Devos Say ‘Only’ 0.02 Percent Of Kids Are Likely To Die Once They Return To School?) There is no record of Biden ever announcing Clymer as his pick to lead the Department of Education. Had he done so, there would be multiple media reports about it, yet none exist. Biden formally announced Dec. 23 that Cardona, not Clymer, was his nominee for education secretary, according to CNN  While it is unclear where exactly the rumor originated, Clymer addressed it in a Dec. 15 tweet. She appeared to satirically confirm the nomination, a move that may have caused further confusion, according to The Sun. In a subsequent tweet, she seemed to hint that her initial tweet was meant to be a joke by listing her lack of experience in the education field.  It’s true. I have zero years teaching in public schools, no experience in education policy, and I’ve never worked at a federal agency, but I am proud be the next Secretary of Education. It’s the culmination of a dream I’ve had for the last 30 minutes. https://t.co/zKwpTRHZmO — Charlotte Clymer ????️‍???? (@cmclymer) December 16, 2020   “It’s true,” Clymer appeared to sarcastically tweet. “I have zero years teaching in public schools, no experience in education policy, and I’ve never worked at a federal agency, but I am proud be the next Secretary of Education. It’s the culmination of a dream I’ve had for the last 30 minutes.” Cardona, Biden’s actual pick for the position, was appointed to the Connecticut education commission role in August 2019, according to his biography on the Connecticut State Department of Education website. He had come to the Connecticut State Department with two decades of experience as a public school educator in Meriden, Connecticut. “With Dr. Miguel Cardona leading the way, we’re going to ensure every student in this country receives a high-quality education,” Biden tweeted on Wednesday.

Verdict: False The needle used in Pence’s vaccination was not covered by a cap during the injection, other photos and footage from the event show.   Fact Check: The Facebook post uses a photo of Pence on Dec. 18 receiving his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to question whether the vice president actually received the jab. “Pence getting a Covid Death shot with the cap still on,” reads the text above the picture. “These people are so transparent.” The image in the Facebook post is one of several photos of Pence’s vaccination taken by Agence France-Presse (AFP) that can be found on Getty Images. While the hand of the health care worker administering the vaccine appears to block the view of the needle in that particular photo, other pictures and video from the event show there was not a cap on the needle when Pence received the jab. (RELATED: Did An Alabama Nurse Die After Receiving The COVID-19 Vaccine?)  For instance, a photo taken by Saul Loeb for AFP shows the needle extending beyond the blue part of the syringe, while another picture from Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik depicts the needle as clearly visible. The syringe’s exposed needle can also be seen in a CNBC video posted on YouTube.  The blue piece visible at the end of the syringe is likely either a needle hub or a needle adapter. A needle hub attaches the needle to a syringe, according to the Pharmaceutics and Compounding Laboratory at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy.

Versions of the text targeting other politicians have been circulating online for years.   Fact Check: The image, which appears to show a screen grab of another Facebook post, purportedly shares a passage that was originally published in a Prague newspaper and later translated to English. The passage insists, in part, that the “danger to America is not Joseph Biden, but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the Presidency” and goes on to criticize the electorate. “The Republic can survive a Biden, who is, after all, merely a fool,” the excerpt reads. “It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president.” (RELATED: Did AARP Endorse Joe Biden For President?)  Check Your Fact didn’t find any evidence the passage about Biden actually comes from a Prague newspaper. An internet search showed that the lengthy quote has been circulating for at least eight years with different political figures as the subject. For example, Snopes reported in 2012 that the authorship of the article was falsely attributed to Václav Klaus, the president of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013, and that his subject was Obama, not Biden. Other figures targeted by the alleged article include former South African President Jacob Zuma and former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Some iterations of the claim attribute the excerpt to Prager Zeitung, a newspaper based in the Czech Republic. A search of the newspaper’s website, however, shows no instances of the newspaper publishing the disparaging comments about either Obama or Biden. The editor in chief of Prager Zeitung, Marcus Hundt, told Reuters that the Czech outlet “never published such an article” about Obama or Biden. He further added that Prager Zeitung “primarily reports on events in the Czech Republic and Europe and not on domestic affairs in other counties (sic).”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A CDC spokesperson confirmed the tweet did not come from the agency. Fact Check:   The tweet, allegedly from the CDC’s verified Twitter account @CDCgov, reads, “It is more ethical to shoplift and leave the store to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than it is to wait in line and pay. Please protect others.” It also directs people to visit a specific page on the CDC website to get more information about the coronavirus. However, there is no record of the CDC sending the pictured tweet. The CDC does not currently have the tweet on its Twitter timeline, and Check Your Fact didn’t find the tweet in various archived versions of the agency’s timeline on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. The agency also does not appear to have published guidance to the tweet’s effect on its website. The CDC tweeting such a message would likely prompt some media coverage as well. Belsie González, a CDC senior public affairs specialist, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the tweet “does not come from our Twitter account or any other CDC official channel.” (RELATED: Does The CDC Deliver Groceries And Cleaning Supplies To People In Quarantine?)  The fake CDC tweet may have originated on the social media accounts of comedic writer Cory Snearowski, who shared the fabricated screen grab on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts on Dec. 18. On his Twitter, it appeared in a thread featuring other seemingly satirical fake CDC tweets. In guidance released ahead of Thanksgiving, the CDC recommended shopping online for the winter holidays, using contactless services such as curbside pick-up for purchased items and shopping in open air markets. The CDC also advises people to wear face coverings, practice social distancing, avoid busy hours and use home delivery for essential errands like grocery shopping.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no indication that Biden or Obama sent tweets calling for Wine’s freedom.   Fact Check: Wine, a former musician, is one of several candidates running against President Yoweri Museveni in the Ugandan presidential election. Wine was detained on Nov. 3 for not limiting crowd size during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The New York Times, though he will still be on the ballot. He returned to his residence shortly after his detention, the outlet reported. A post shared on Facebook appears to show screen grabs of two Nov. 18 tweets — one from Obama and one from Biden — reading, “#FreeBobiWine.” (RELATED: Does Uganda Only Have 19 Coronavirus Related Deaths Because of Hydroxychloroquine?)  However, both tweets appear to have been fabricated. If Biden or Obama had called for the release of Wine from prison, it likely would have been covered by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. A search of both Obama’s and Biden’s verified Twitter accounts turned up no matches for the pictured tweets. Biden appears to have last tweeted about Uganda in 2019 in regards to LGBTQ rights. There is no reference from Obama of Bobi Wine on Twitter. “LGBTQ rights are human rights,” Biden tweeted in October 2019. “Uganda’s proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period.” Misinformation regarding the 2021 Ugandan election has permeated social media, including a video that falsely claims to show Biden calling for Wine’s release, according to BBC News.    share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo actually shows a crowd in Paris celebrating the French national men’s soccer team’s win at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.   Fact Check: Social media users shared the photo of thousands of people packed tightly together on Paris’ iconic Champs-Elysees Avenue with text above that reads, “Looks Like Paris Has Had Enough Tonight! The World Is Awake. 18.12.2020 Paris.” Some Facebook users suggested the protest allegedly depicted in the picture was against COVID-19 restrictions and financial institutions. “FRANCE is STANDING UP!!” reads the caption of one such post. “NO MORE BANKSTERS CONTROL! NO More Fake Covid Controls .. NO MORE Money / Financial Controls .. LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY!!!” (RELATED: Does This Video Show An Anti-Lockdown Protest In London?)  The picture has been miscaptioned, a reverse image search revealed. Taken by photographer Ludovic Marin for Agence France-Presse (AFP), the photo actually shows people in Paris celebrating the French national men’s soccer team’s victory over Croatia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It can be found on both the AFP and Getty Images websites. “This picture taken from the top of the Arch of Triumph (Arc de Triomphe) on July 15, 2018 shows people lighting flares as they celebrate after France won the Russia 2018 World Cup final football match against Croatia, on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris,” reads the description on Getty Images. While the photo being shared doesn’t show a recent Paris protest, there have been a number of protests in the city in recent months. For instance, hundreds of Parisians took to the streets in October to demonstrate against measures adopted by the government to curb the spread of COVID-19, according to Bloomberg. People in Paris also gathered in November and December to protest a proposed security bill that would make it more difficult to film police officers, according to media reports.

Verdict: False Chauvin is alive, according to his attorney. The rumor about him being killed in prison originated on a satire website.   Fact Check: Social media users have been sharing a screen grab of an article, titled “Police Officer Who Murdered George Floyd Killed In Prison,” that was published Dec. 19 on the website Redcountry. The article alleges that Chauvin, a former cop charged in George Floyd’s death, was killed in prison by other inmates and bequeathed half of his estate to President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Floyd, a black man who died in May after Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe, video of the incident shows. Floyd’s death sparked worldwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality, according to CNN.  The former Minneapolis police officer was not recently killed in prison, contrary to the Facebook image and article’s claims. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Former Minneapolis Cop Derek Chauvin Wearing A ‘Make Whites Great Again’ Hat?) Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric Nelson, told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Tuesday in an email that Chauvin “is alive,” noting that his client was “previously bailed out of jail pursuant to the court’s order.” Chauvin was released from jail in October on a $1 million non-cash bond, USA Today reported. The Redcountry article appears to lift word-for-word from a satirical article published at least several months earlier on Conservative Tears, a satirical news website that disclaims “everything on this website is fiction” on its “about us” page. Some websites posted the Conservative Tears article about Chauvin dying on their websites without clearly disclaiming the satirical origins, a common way misinformation spreads online. Chauvin’s trial for the charges related to Floyd’s death is scheduled to take place in 2021, according to ABC affiliate KSTP.

It appears to be fabricated.   Fact Check: The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a Dec. 18 tweet Trump allegedly sent from his verified personal Twitter account @realDonaldTrump that mentions the Insurrection Act, which, according to NPR, gives the president emergency powers to deploy the armed forces to areas across the U.S. Some social media users appeared to believe the tweet was genuine, with one user saying, “It’s happening.” “Under the Insurrection Act I have declared Martial Law,” reads the purported tweet. “This was an attempted coup. Arrest (sic) are being carried out all over the nation. Biden has surrendered his passport. More to come!”  The tweet, however, appears to be fabricated. A search of Trump’s verified Twitter accounts — @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — turned up no matching tweet. ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets also shows no record of it. Had Trump sent the pictured tweet, major media outlets would have reported on it, yet no such coverage exists. Social media users often create fake tweets using websites like FakeTrumpTweet.com and TweetGen.com. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, ‘Republican Governors Should Not Be Shutting Down Their States’?) The fabricated tweet circulated on Facebook amid media reports that Trump recently asked about martial law in a White House meeting after former national security advisor Michael Flynn allegedly proposed invoking it to overturn the presidential election results. Despite Trump’s claims of election fraud, the Department of Justice found no evidence that widespread fraud occurred in the election, Attorney General William Barr said in early December, according to the Associated Press. Trump addressed reports that he was considering martial law in a tweet on Dec. 20, saying, “Martial law = Fake News.

It appears to be a misrepresentation of a statement she made about the Georgia economy in 2018.   Fact Check: Abrams, who ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, spoke at a Dec. 15 campaign rally with President-elect Joe Biden for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The candidates are running against Republican Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the state’s Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections. The Facebook image shows Abrams speaking at a podium and attributes a quote to her reading, “We don’t need Farmers, When we have Grocery stores.” (RELATED: Will Stacey Abrams Be The First Private Citizen To Respond To SOTU Address?)  However, there is no record of Abrams ever making such a statement. A search of Abrams’ verified Twitter and Facebook accounts turned up no matches for the statement. Had she made this comment, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none appear to have done so. The claim appears to stem from a misrepresentation of a statement Abrams made during her 2018 gubernatorial campaign. “I want to create a lot of different jobs,” Abrams said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. “Because people shouldn’t have to go into agriculture or hospitality in Georgia to make a living in Georgia. Why not create renewable energy jobs? Because, I’m going to tell y’all a secret: Climate change is real.” Abrams later clarified this statement on Twitter after an attack ad from Republicans used the quote to insinuate that she insulted farmers, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.  To be clear, my point is that we must continue to diversify our economy and raise wages across the board. Agriculture and hospitality are vital sectors of our economy in Georgia – but we can do more and lead in new sectors as well. https://t.co/3eiv8c3QHr — Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) October 16, 2018  “To be clear, my point is that we must continue to diversify our economy and raise wages across the board,” Abrams tweeted. “Agriculture and hospitality are vital sectors of our economy in Georgia – but we can do more and lead in new sectors as well.”      share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False The product is a hoax that was likely meant to be a joke. A spokesperson for Pfizer confirmed the pictured device is not a product from the company. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a pre-packaged, single-dose COVID-19 vaccine “vaporizer cartridge” produced by Pfizer, the company that collaborated with German pharmaceutical firm BioNTech to create a COVID-19 vaccine that recently received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The package, which seems authentic at first glance, includes a Pfizer logo and information about the dosage and production. Pfizer, however, has not released the pictured electronic cigarette product, despite some social media users appearing to believe the “vaporizer cartridge” is legitimate. Had the company put out such a product, it would have been covered by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Pfizer has also not published a press release about the coronavirus vaccine “vaporizer cartridge.” Aspects of the packaging suggest the fake Pfizer product may have been created as a joke. For instance, the phrase “Makers of ‘The Boner Pill’” appears below the Pfizer logo. (RELATED: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Claims Moderna And Pfizer ‘Were Not Involved In Operation Warp Speed’)  “That is not a Pfizer product,” confirmed Pfizer spokesperson Andy Widger in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Our COVID-19 vaccine currently comes in multi dose vials and is an injectable vaccine.” The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is administered via injection “intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.3 mL each) 3 weeks apart,” according to an FDA fact sheet. The vaccine received an EUA from the FDA on Dec. 11. Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems confirmed there is no familial relation between Valerie Biden Owens and Stephen Owens. Valerie Biden Owens is married to John T. Owens, not the co-founder of the private equity firm that holds the majority ownership stake in Dominion Voting Systems.   Fact Check: In the weeks following the election, the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of baseless allegations of election fraud, according to the Washington Post. Now a viral Facebook post attempts to connect President-elect Joe Biden to the company by claiming his sister is married to Stephen Owens, who, the post alleges, owns Dominion Voting Systems. Stephen Owens is a co-founder and a managing director at the private equity firm Staple Street Capital, according to PitchBook. Staple Street Capital owns 75.2 percent of Dominion Voting Systems, Dominion CEO John Poulos said in a letter responding to a request from the House Committee on Administration, according to The Associated Press. Poulos also said that he owns 12 percent of the company and that no other investor owns more than a 5 percent stake, the outlet reported.  Joe Biden has one sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who has advised him throughout his career in politics, Quartz reported. Valerie Biden Owens is married to John T. Owens, not Stephen Owens, according to a wedding announcement in The New York Times. John T. Owens owns the Delaware-based telemedicine company Mediguide International, the Washington Post reported Dec. 14. A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that there is no family connection between Stephen Owens and Valerie Biden Owens. A spokesperson for Staple Street also told Snopes that Stephen Owens has no relation to the Biden family. Other iterations of the claim also baselessly attempt to link R. Kevin Owens, the brother of John T. Owens and an attorney, to Dominion Voting Systems, Snopes reported. (RELATED: Does Attorney General William Barr Sit On The Board Of Dominion Voting Systems?) Owens is a fairly common last name in the U.S. The claim that Valerie Biden Owens is married to Stephen Owens appears to stem from confusion surrounding the two having the same last name. We rate this claim false.

Verdict: False Media reports, images and video from the event show well over 20 people were present. Biden has been holding smaller events to comply with COVID-19 restrictions.   Fact Check: Biden, who won Georgia by over 12,600 votes, campaigned in the state on Dec.15 for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The candidates are running against Republican Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the state’s Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections. One post on Facebook claims only 20 people showed up to the rally, while another post went further, claiming “no one” attended the rally. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Say ‘Hello, Minnesota’ At A Campaign Rally In Florida?)  In reality, images and video from the event show more than 20 attendants. Videos of the crowd at the rally published by C-SPAN and CBS News depict over a dozen cars parked near the stage. A photo posted by The Associated Press, for instance, shows dozens of supporters gathered on a sidewalk as Biden’s motorcade drove by before the event. In addition, The New York Times reported that hundreds of people lined up on the sidewalk to watch the rally, while the Valdosta Daily Times reported there were “a little less than 200 cars” in attendance. The rally was a drive-in car rally, meaning that many people stayed in their cars to watch Biden speak. Biden has previously held drive-in rallies, such as in Toledo, Ohio and St. Paul, Minnesota, in an effort to adhere to COVID-19 safety recommendations, according to The New York Times.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any media reporting about Dover dying. The hospital where Dover works tweeted on Monday that she is “doing well.”   Fact Check: Baseless claims about nurses dying after receiving their first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have circulated on social media since health care workers started receiving jabs last week. This particular Facebook post claims Dover has died, saying, “OMFG! FAINTING NURSE DIED!! TIFFANY DOVER IS DEAD!!” Dover, a nurse manager at Chattanooga’s CHI Memorial Hospital, had previously fainted on camera Thursday after receiving her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to ABC affiliate WTVC-9. She had explained to WTVC-9 and other outlets that her fainting had nothing to do with the safety of the vaccine but rather a health condition that causes her to faint when she feels pain.  Social media users have alleged she has since died, despite no national or local reporting that such a thing has occurred. CHI Memorial Hospital tweeted on Monday that she is “doing well” and shared a short video that featured Dover, very much alive, posing for a photo with her colleagues.  We’re pleased to share Tiffany Dover is doing well. Here’s a short video of her today surrounded by her colleagues who all support her. pic.twitter.com/yGyzKvwn89 — CHI Memorial (@CHI_Memorial) December 21, 2020   “We’re pleased to share Tiffany Dover is doing well,” the Dec. 21 tweet reads. “Here’s a short video of her today surrounded by her colleagues who all support her.” (RELATED: Did An Alabama Nurse Die After Receiving The COVID-19 Vaccine?) CHI Memorial Hospital also tweeted on Dec. 19 that she is “doing well,” saying, “UPDATE: Nurse Tiffany Dover appreciates the concern shown for her. She is home and doing well. She asks for privacy for her and her family.”  UPDATE: Nurse Tiffany Dover appreciates the concern shown for her. She is home and doing well. She asks for privacy for her and her family. — CHI Memorial (@CHI_Memorial) December 19, 2020   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes on its website that the agency has “received reports of people fainting after nearly all vaccinations” and that “scientists think that fainting is due to the vaccination process and not to the vaccines themselves.” It can be triggered by the pain or anxiety associated with the vaccination process, according to the CDC. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a Dec. 10 briefing document on the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that it had found “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA.” The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA on Dec. 11.

Verdict: False The image shows Maxwell with French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel.   Fact Check: In recent days, social media users have claimed the man pictured sitting on the couch with Maxwell is Roberts, the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Maxwell, a longtime associate and ex-girlfriend of Epstein, pleaded not guilty in July after being arrested earlier that month on charges of helping the deceased financier recruit and groom underage girls for sex, according to ABC News. “Supreme Court Justice John Roberts hanging out with Ex-Jeffrey Epstein girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell,” one Facebook user captioned the photo. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Donald Trump Embracing Jeffrey Epstein)  Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact discovered Roberts does not appear in the photo. Uncropped versions of the picture have been published in outlets such as the Daily Mail and The Canadian, where the man is identified as Brunel, a French modeling agent. Other photos of Brunel can be seen in The Guardian, The Times and Yahoo! Finance. Brunel, an associate of Epstein, was arrested this month in France at the Charles de Gaulle airport, CBS News reported. Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said Brunel has been charged with sexual harassment and rape of minors over 15 years old, according to The New York Times. The false claim that the photo shows Roberts spread on social media around the time attorney Lin Wood Jr. made several allegations about the chief justice on Twitter. Wood’s tweets, which included the unproven claim that the “John Roberts” in the flight logs for Epstein’s private jet is Roberts, came after the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit aiming to overturn presidential election results in several states, according to Newsweek.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/thomas.kraft.1610/posts/3374794972619766,https://www.facebook.com/thomas.kraft.1610/posts/3374794972619766,https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/united-states-v-ghislaine-maxwell,https://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-maxwell-epsteins-alleged-recruiter-pleads-not-guilty/story?id=71775853,https://www.facebook.com/thomas.kraft.1610/posts/3374794972619766,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/29/fact-check-donald-trump-embracing-epstein/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7412513/Life-paedophile-island-revealed-new-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-St-Barts-mansion.html,https://thecanadian.news/2020/12/18/a-former-model-accuses-jean-luc-brunel-of-having-turned-her-towards-epstein/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/19/french-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-charged-in-jeffery-epstein-inquiry,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jean-luc-brunel-the-catwalk-king-who-raped-and-pimped-out-models-to-jeffrey-epstein-pjc9p08c5,https://fr.finance.yahoo.com/actualites/affaire-epstein-fran%C3%A7ais-jean-luc-124106617.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI414k1RGNWWr8t5rCD1gn62QUl_Me0voUsYooJyNcQAMaQ5MxVZ8EMztIVXkEHAWpDz6G6IYeg63Y_9uOmv6x0R8RCQCfND0kkdgabOyI_EUAypgQYlLqiFuWtRJXxP2duXOcu44PYGaX544qDaRNq0LUrCnIsvT5e9Vfy5HNBm,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jean-luc-brunel-arrest-paris-models-tears-of-joy-alleged-victims/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/world/europe/france-epstein-brunel.html,https://www.newsweek.com/lin-wood-justice-roberts-qanon-epstein-1555887,https://twitter.com/LLinWood/status/1339640105800089600?s=20,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/21/facebook-posts/no-viral-photo-doesnt-show-chief-justice-john-robe/,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html,https://www.newsweek.com/lin-wood-justice-roberts-qanon-epstein-1555887,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#384c4a5d4e574a785b505d5b5341574d4a5e595b4c165b5755",Does This Photo Show Chief Justice John Roberts With Ghislaine Maxwell?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Other photos from Pelosi’s vaccination show the needle extended beyond the orange part of the syringe. The orange part is likely a needle hub meant to connect the needle to the syringe.   Fact Check: Pelosi and other lawmakers received their first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, the Washington Post reported. Multiple Facebook users are now suggesting the House speaker didn’t actually receive the injection, citing photos that they claim show an orange cap over the syringe’s needle. While the needle is not clearly visible in the press pool photo featured in the post, other photos from the event show that the needle extends beyond the orange part of the syringe. For instance, a picture available on Getty Images shows the needle shortly before she received the injection. In another photo available through Reuters, the needle is also visible past the orange part.  The orange piece that some social media users mistakenly thought was a cap is likely a needle hub. A needle hub attaches the needle to the syringe and does not cover the needle, according to the Pharmaceutics and Compounding Laboratory at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy.    Pelosi tweeted Dec. 18 that she received the vaccine, saying in part, “As the vaccine is being distributed, we must all continue mask wearing, social distancing & other science-based steps to save lives & crush the virus.”  Today, with confidence in science & at the direction of the Office of the Attending Physician, I received the COVID-19 vaccine.

Verdict: False There is no evidence O’Sullivan was killed for investigating the 2020 election. The GBI has refuted the claim, calling it “baseless,” “irresponsible” and “reckless.”   Fact Check: O’Sullivan died Dec. 14 at the age of 51 in his Georgia home, according to his obituary. While the Candler County coroner said to NBC affiliate WSAV on Thursday that the agent’s cause of death is under investigation, some social media users have baselessly attempted to link it to the 2020 election. This particular Facebook post, which shows a screen grab of O’Sullivan’s obituary, alleges he was killed “for investigating the Georg!a e1ect!on$.” Other iterations of the claim suggest O’Sullivan was investigating a Dec. 4 car crash that left Harrison Deal, a campaign staffer for Republican Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, dead.  There is, however, no indication that O’Sullivan was killed because of an election-related investigation. The GBI refuted in a Dec. 16 tweet thread the viral rumors that the agent’s death was connected to the 2020 election. (RELATED: Did Georgia’s DeKalb County Reject 40,000 Mail-In Ballots?)

(2/2) — GA Bureau of Investigation (@GBI_GA) December 16, 2020   “A GBI agent passed away this week and there are online rumors that it was somehow connected to the election. This baseless claim is irresponsible & reckless,” the GBI tweeted. “It is hurtful to the agent’s family and co-workers. Please be mindful of the things you write, repeat, or share – especially when there is absolutely no truth in them.” In a Dec. 17 tweet, the GBI also said that “no GBI agent or GBI regional investigative office is investigating” Deal’s fatal car crash. The bureau noted that its medical examiner’s office “conducted an autopsy as the ME’s Office routinely does.”  There is no GBI investigation.

Our Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an autopsy as the ME’s Office routinely does. — GA Bureau of Investigation (@GBI_GA) December 17, 2020   While there is no evidence O’Sullivan was investigating the election, the GBI has been asked to assist the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office with investigations related to the election, according to a Dec. 8 statement on Facebook. The GBI’s statement on Facebook said GBI agents will “conduct interviews and investigative acts regarding allegations of fraud as reported to the SOS’s Office.” President-elect Joe Biden won Georgia by over 12,600 votes, according to the official results on the George Secretary of State’s website. The state’s electors cast Georgia’s 16 Electoral College votes for Biden on Dec. 14, The Associated Press reported.

One user posted the picture with the caption saying in part, “Hmmmmmmm, notice this is a plastic dosing syringe for oral medicine??? THERE IS NO NEEDLE!!!” The Department of Defense tweeted the photo featured in the Facebook post on Dec. 15 along with a quote from Miller that reads, “Got the vaccine yesterday afternoon.

Another photo, taken by Ferninando at the same event and posted on the website Flickr, shows Miller receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with a syringe that has a needle. The Hill also posted a video of Miller receiving the jab on YouTube. In that video, the needle attached to the syringe can be clearly seen.

The logo seems to have led some Facebook users to believe the department created and published the graphic, with one user saying, “The PA hitler is at it again.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi Violating COVID-19 Safety Guidelines For Social Gatherings)  There is, however, no evidence the graphic came from the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania website lists wearing face coverings indoors and outdoors while away from home and limiting unnecessary travel among measures to help limit the spread of COVID-19.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/gmcgowan28/posts/4140424502638401,https://www.facebook.com/gmcgowan28/posts/4140424502638401,https://www.facebook.com/gmcgowan28/posts/4140424502638401,https://www.facebook.com/gmcgowan28/posts/4140424502638401,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/17/fact-check-viral-image-nancy-pelosi-violating-covid-19-guidelines-social-gatherings/,https://www.facebook.com/pennsylvaniadepartmentofhealth,https://twitter.com/PAHealthDept,https://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx?fbclid=IwAR2g1spw_sBDxS94vpiplnng9_1YYkerFEzubhO4aSSheJZ5bEj9JiiJM7s,https://twitter.com/PAHealthDept/status/1339295338256080900,https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gail?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/iZ6b45pdpz,https://twitter.com/PAHealthDept/status/1339295338256080900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/PAHealthDept/status/1339295338256080900,https://6abc.com/8692304/?fbclid=IwAR1I3-ReuXP_hDjMduA5uyctLJgZXzOwRWWU0MHXv_06BwIj-vHn_1HbXSo,https://6abc.com/8692304/?fbclid=IwAR1I3-ReuXP_hDjMduA5uyctLJgZXzOwRWWU0MHXv_06BwIj-vHn_1HbXSo,https://www.pa.gov/guides/responding-to-covid-19/#COVIDMitigationinPennsylvania,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fc888e998a938ebc9f94999f978593898e9a9d9f88d29f9391",Viral Image Claims To Show A ‘COVID-19 Winter Activity Restrictions’ Infographic Created By The Pennsylvania Department Of Health,,,,,,

Verdict: False Trump has not announced his plans for Jan. 20 at the time of publication. The statement appears to be fabricated, as there is no record of it being published.   Fact Check:  The Electoral College on Dec. 15 confirmed Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, The Associated Press reported. Trump has not officially conceded the election, though he said to reporters on Thanksgiving that he would leave the White House on Inauguration Day if the Electoral College selected Biden, according to NPR. Social media users have been sharing an image that purportedly shows a Dec. 16 statement from Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien stating that the campaign will be hosting its own inauguration ceremony for Trump at his Mar-A-Lago resort on Jan. 20, the date of Biden’s inauguration. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Trump Supporters Demonstrating In DC On Dec. 12?)  “President of the United States of America, and winner of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Donald J. Trump, and his Administration look forward to the January 20th Inauguration of their continuation of power and Second Term,” the statement reads, in part. The announcement further states that, “Any attempt to remove the Trump administration will require force.” There is no evidence, however, that the Trump campaign has put out the statement shown in the Facebook post. A search of Trump’s campaign website, which holds a list of press releases, does not list the alleged statement from Stepien. @TrumpEmail, a Twitter account that keeps records of fundraising emails from the Trump campaign, likewise did not show any emails announcing a plan to hold a separate inauguration. Media outlets also almost certainly would have covered the statement if the campaign had actually sent it out. The fabricated campaign statement may stem from Axios reporting that Trump is considering holding a political rally opposite Biden’s inauguration. Trump has not announced his plans for Jan. 20. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a Dec. 2 press briefing that, “He knows what his decision is, and he’ll make his decision at the right time.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While Barr did previously sit on the board of Dominion Energy, there is no indication he has a seat on Dominion Voting Systems’ board. Dominion Energy, a different company, does not list Dominion Voting Systems as a subsidiary in a 2020 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   Fact Check: Election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been a target of baseless allegations of voter fraud, according to the Washington Post. President Donald Trump has echoed these claims on Twitter, accusing the firm of switching votes from him to President-elect Joe Biden. Barr said on Dec.1 that the U.S. Justice Department found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, The Associated Press reported. A post on Facebook appears to attempt to connect Barr to the alleged voter fraud, saying, “I just found out that Bill Barr is on the Board of Directors of dominion voting machines.”  The post appears to be confusing two companies with similar names: Dominion Voting Systems and Dominion Energy. Barr used to sit on the board of directors for Dominion Energy, a separate company. (RELATED: Is The Chairman Of Dominion Voting Systems Part Of Joe Biden’s Transition Team?) Barr was appointed to Dominion Energy’s board of directors in December 2009, according to a company press release. He resigned in February 2019, after he was confirmed to the position of attorney general, Dominion Energy spokesman Ryan Frazier told Check Your Fact in an email. Dominion Energy does not list Dominion Voting Systems among its subsidiaries in its February 2020 annual 10-K report filed with the SEC. Dominion Energy’s roots can be traced back to before the American Revolutionary War and adopted the name “Dominion Resources” in 1983, according to an archived company website. The company rebranded as Dominion Energy in 2017. Dominion Voting Systems was founded in 2002. Kay Stimson, Dominion Voting Systems’ Vice President of Government Affairs, told Check Your Fact in an email that it was the “wrong company” when asked if Barr sat on Dominion Voting Systems’ board. Trump announced in a Dec. 14 tweet that Barr would be resigning from his position as attorney general.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence an Alabama nurse who received the vaccine has died. The Alabama Department of Public Health put out a statement saying “there have been no deaths of vaccine recipients.”   Fact Check: The first COVID-19 vaccines in Alabama were administered to frontline health care workers earlier this week, according to NBC affiliate WSFA 12 News. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims A Vaccine Stored At -80 Degrees ‘Isn’t A Vaccine’ And Is Meant For ‘Genetic Manipulation’) Now social media users are sharing posts that allege an unidentified Alabama nurse died after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with some Facebook posts specifying that the nurse was 42 years old and died, possibly from an allergic reaction, after eight to 10 hours. The U.K.’s National Health Service gave precautionary advice last week that people with “significant history of allergic reactions” should not get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after two health workers, who have since recovered, had allergic reactions, according to CNN.  While CBS affiliate WHNT News 19 did report that a 54-year-old Colbert County nurse passed away on Dec. 14 from COVID-19 complications, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any national or local media outlets reporting about a nurse in the state dying after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The Alabama Department of Public Health put out a statement debunking “multiple posts on social media reporting a death in Alabama of a recipient of the COVID-19 vaccine.”  “The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) has reached out to all hospitals in the state which administered the COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed there have been no deaths of vaccine recipients,” that statement reads in part. “The posts are untrue.” The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a Dec. 10 briefing document on the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that it had found “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA.” The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA on Dec. 11. The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reports at the time of publication that the U.S. has recorded over 17.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases. Over 311,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, according to the university’s interactive map.

Kennedy’s Personal Attorney?10:33 AM 12/18/2020Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook claims incoming Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue’s father was former President John F. Kennedy’s personal attorney.  Verdict: False While they have similar last names, there is no indication Donoghue and the pictured man, Richard Donahue, are related. Donoghue confirmed the post’s claim is incorrect.   Fact Check: President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Monday that Attorney General William Barr has resigned from his position and that Jeff Rosen would be taking over in an acting capacity next week. He also announced that Donoghue would be taking over Rosen’s deputy attorney general position. Shortly after the announcement, some Facebook users began sharing a screen grab of a Dec. 15 tweet containing a photo of Donahue, the late Massachusetts lawyer who, according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library archives, served as a special consultant and aide to the president during Kennedy’s administration, posing with his family and Kennedy in the Oval Office. The tweet reads, “The new Deputy Attorney General, Richard Donoghue’s father was JFK’s personal attorney.”  Donahue passed away in September 2015 at the age of 88, according to the Washington Post. Donahue’s obituary, which was published in the Lowell Sun newspaper, lists all 11 of his children by name. While one of Donahue’s son’s first names is Richard, there is no indication that the son and Donoghue are the same person. They have different middle names and last names. (RELATED: Did JFK Plan To Expose A Plot To ‘Enslave Every Man, Woman And Child’ Before He Was Assassinated?) In a LinkedIn message to the Daily Caller News Foundation, Donoghue confirmed that the claim his father worked as Kennedy’s personal lawyer “is incorrect.” The claim appears to have stemmed from confusion about them having similar names.

Verdict: False The image was taken in January 2020, over a week before the U.S. confirmed its first COVID-19 case.   Fact Check: Under phase two coronavirus restrictions put in place by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, indoor gatherings are currently limited to 10 people, and restaurants are limited to operating at 25 percent capacity indoors. Masks must be worn inside public establishments except while eating or drinking, according to the guidelines. A post on Facebook shares an image of Pelosi gathered around several people. No one appears to be wearing a mask or practicing social distancing. The photo’s caption reads, “Ladies and Gentlemen here’s your speaker of the house enjoying a party after she tells you you can’t have social gatherings.”  Through a reverse image search, however, Check Your Fact found that the image is actually from the Jan. 7 opening of Maialino Mare, a restaurant in D.C. The image was taken by Washingtonian Magazine food editor Anna Spiegel and posted on her Twitter account that same day.  Nancy Pelosi at Danny Meyer’s Maialino Mare opening in Navy Yard. pic.twitter.com/OMkVtxeEEk — Anna Spiegel (@AnnaSpiegs) January 8, 2020  “Nancy Pelosi at Danny Meyer’s Maialino Mare opening in Navy Yard,” Spiegel tweeted along with the photo. (RELATED: Was Nancy Pelosi Pictured With The Manson Family In 1969?) Pelosi was not in violation of any COVID-19 restrictions in D.C. in the image. D.C. reported its first positive COVID-19 case on March 7, two months after the photo of Pelosi was taken, ABC 7 reported. Bowser then declared a public health emergency on March 11 and issued a stay at home order on March 30, according to DCist. The novel coronavirus first emerged in China late last year, according to the New York Times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t confirm the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. until Jan. 21, over a week after Pelosi attended the restaurant opening. Pelosi’s office previously addressed claims that she violated COVID-19 safety guidelines in San Francisco in September while receiving a haircut indoors, CNN reported.      share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image has been doctored to include Xi. Time Magazine only named Biden and Harris as the outlet’s 2020 “Person of the Year.”   Fact Check: Time Magazine annually selects its “Person of the Year,” the criterion for which the magazine states is being “the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year.” One image shared on Facebook claims that the magazine selected Xi alongside Biden and Harris for the title this year. The image shows the alleged cover of the “Person of the Year” edition of the magazine, featuring the side profiles of the three politicians and text that reads, “Xi Jinping, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris – Changing America’s Story.” The entire image is surrounded by Time Magazine’s signature red border. The Facebook post’s caption reads, “Time’s Persons of the Year, we’re screwed.”  Time Magazine announced on Twitter last week that Biden and Harris had been named its 2020 “Person of the Year.” Only Biden and Harris appear on the magazine’s real cover.  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are TIME’s 2020 Person of the Year #TIMEPOY https://t.co/o97QNlSBrl pic.twitter.com/KuoBoebBN4 — TIME (@TIME) December 11, 2020   Xi’s picture and name seems to have been simply photoshopped into the altered cover being shared on Facebook. Unlike Biden and Harris, Jinping’s side profile lacks a neck and shoulders, and he appears to be awkwardly placed between the pair. Kristin Matzen, communications director for Time Magazine, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the cover featuring Xi “is not authentic.” (RELATED: Did Time Magazine Publish A Cover Calling Barack Obama The ‘Kingpin Of The Biggest Political Scandal In Modern History?’) Check Your Fact has previously debunked viral claims about Time Magazine covers.

Verdict: False The photo actually shows the 2018 pro-gun control “March for Our Lives” rally.   Fact Check: Thousands of Trump supporters gathered in the national capital on Dec. 12 to protest against the presidential election results, with some skirmishes breaking out between protesters and counterprotesters, according to The New York Times. Trump supporters previously held a similar event, promoted on social media as the “Million MAGA March,” in November, according to NPR. In the days following the Dec. 12 protest, some social media users shared a photo of a large crowd gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue near the National Gallery of Art that they claim depicts a scene from the pro-Trump event. However, the picture actually shows the pro-gun control “March for Our Lives” rally that occurred in March 2018. (RELATED: Was There A Communications Blackout In DC During George Floyd Protests On June 1?)  Photographer Shannon Finney took the photo for Getty Images on March 24, 2018, according to the caption. The “March for Our Lives” rally in D.C. came after the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that year in Parkland, Florida that left 17 dead. David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and political activist, tweeted about social media users miscaptioning the “March for Our Lives” rally photo on Dec. 13.

Verdict: False The man’s attorney confirmed he is alive. The claim appears to originate from a satirical article.   Fact Check: Delaware computer repair shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac claimed that someone who identified himself as Hunter Biden dropped off laptops at his shop for repair in April 2019, according to CBS News. Mac Isaac said that he later gave a copied hard drive from one of the laptops to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer Brian Costello, the outlet reported. The New York Post published in October purported emails and other materials from Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop after Giuliani provided the outlet a copy of the hard drive that supposedly came from the device. Social media users have recently been sharing a screen grab of a headline that reads, “Computer Shop Owner Who Raised Alarm About Hunter Biden Laptop Found Dead.” The accompanying photo of Mac Isaac closely resembles the one featured in a GoFundMe legal defense fundraiser set up by his attorney Brian Della Rocca.  There is no evidence to indicate Mac Isaac has died. Had he been found dead as the image claims, major media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none appear to have done so. On Dec. 5, two days after the Facebook post was shared, Mac Isaac shared a video on YouTube titled “The Truth,” in which he denied being a hacker and having ties to Russia. Della Rocca confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that Mac Isaac “is very much alive.” The attorney previously told the Delaware News Journal that Mac Isaac closed his computer repair shop after receiving numerous death threats. (RELATED: Did Jill Biden Say, ‘Whatever Is On Hunter’s Laptop Is Not Important?’) The claim appears to originate from a satirical article published on the parody news website America’s Last Line of Defense. While the article contains clear disclaimers of its satirical nature, such as being labeled as “Crime Satire For the Intellectually Impaired,” some websites picked up the story as if it were genuine news. Social media users shared images of such headlines without issuing warning about the satirical nature of its origins, a common way for misinformation to spread.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1340688846278047&id=100010108333639,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-laptop-new-york-post-story/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-laptop-new-york-post-story/,https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/rudy-giuliani-gives-alleged-hunter-biden-laptop-authorities/6005040002/,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1340688846278047&id=100010108333639,https://www.gofundme.com/f/mac-isaac-legal-defense-fund,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=computer+owner+John+Paul+MacIsaac+dead&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M4Vrv2_-Z4&feature=youtu.be,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/24/hunter-biden-laptop-more-details-emerge-rudy-giuliani/6404635002/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/30/fact-check-jill-biden-hunters-laptop-not-important/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/computer-dude-suicided/,https://www.american-flavor.com/computer-shop-owner-who-raised-alarm-about-hunter-biden-laptop-found-dead/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0d4d2c5d6cfd2e0c3c8c5c3cbd9cfd5d2c6c1c3d48ec3cfcd",Was The Computer Repair Shop Owner Who Allegedly Brought Forward A Laptop Belonging To Hunter Biden Found Dead?,,,,,,

Verdict: False While the AMA policymaking body did consider a resolution proposing to rescind the statement, the resolution was not adopted. The AMA has not rescinded its statement regarding hydroxychloroquine.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a Dec. 15 tweet that reads, “BREAKING: After thousands of lives lost, American Medical Association now rescinds hydroxychloroquine prevention order.” Kirstie Alley, an actress who has expressed support for President Donald Trump, tweeted a link to a Gateway Pundit article that made the same claim. The AMA has not rescinded its statement on hydroxychloroquine, contrary to the post’s claim. In March, the AMA jointly issued a statement with the American Pharmacists Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists that expressed opposition against actions that could cause supply disruptions for patients that use the medication and its chemical cousin chloroquine for chronic conditions. Actions that could lead to the supply disruptions include doctors prescribing the medications for themselves, their families and colleagues, as well entities “purchasing excessive amounts of these medications through commercial distribution channels” to create stockpiles, according to the statement.  The statement, updated in April, said that “novel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician’s or other prescriber’s professional judgment” and that “decisions to use these medications off-label must be made with extreme caution and careful monitoring” because “definitive evidence for the role of these drugs in treating COVID-19 patients has not been determined through robust clinical trials.” The AMA encouraged “patient-centered care decisions, made on an individualized basis with patients’ informed consent about the risks and benefits associated with any treatment regimen,” but also noted in the statement that “evidence-based science and practice must guide these determinations.” The AMA’s policymaking body did consider a resolution that proposed rescinding its statement regarding hydroxychloroquine and, among other measures, issuing an updated statement “notifying patients that further studies are ongoing,” according to a document from the AMA’s November 2020 special meeting. However, the resolution was not adopted. Furthermore, the AMA tweeted on Dec. 16 that its position on the matter “remains unchanged.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Nevada ‘Quietly’ Reversed Its Decision To ‘Block” Hydroxychloroquine Prescriptions For COVID-19 Treatment)  In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19.

Thank you @Poynter for the #FactCheck to set record straight https://t.co/hz1j1Xz2St pic.twitter.com/2qfUdFqdRk — AMA (@AmerMedicalAssn) December 16, 2020  “In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID-19,” the AMA tweeted in part. “Our position remains unchanged. Evidence-based #science & practice must guide these determinations.” The Food and Drug Administration in June revoked its emergency use authorization to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients, saying that “recent data from a large randomized controlled trial showed no evidence of benefit for mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation of HCQ treatment” in such patients. President Donald Trump and others had touted hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, according to Reuters. Gateway Pundit and other websites have since updated their stories to reflect that the AMA did not rescind its statement regarding hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 treatment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Amy Klobuchar liked a tweet seemingly making fun of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Verdict: False There is no evidence Klobuchar liked the tweet. The person who liked the tweet was actually a different Twitter user with the same name as the Minnesota senator, according to the pictured Twitter user who tweeted in the meme. Fact Check:   President-elect Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he would be nominating Buttigieg, one his former Democratic rivals for the presidency, to be the Secretary of Transportation, Reuters reported. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A CNN Article About Bernie Sanders Insulting Pete Buttigieg) Following that announcement, an Facebook post appearing to show a screen grab of a tweet from Dec. 15 was posted. The tweet, seemingly in response to Buttigieg’s nomination, shares a meme of the former South Bend mayor eating food with text that reads, “Opportunities I don’t deserve and am not qualified for.” Above the meme, a message says, “Amy Klobuchar and 9 others liked.” There is, however, no evidence Klobuchar liked the tweet. Check Your Fact searched through the liked tweets on both of Klobuchar’s verified Twitter profiles – @amyklobuchar and @SenAmyKlobuchar – and did not find the tweet containing the meme of Buttigieg. Major media outlets didn’t report about the Minnesota senator liking the tweet either.  The Twitter user who first posted the meme later replied to her own tweet, saying, “People on this website are so gullible omg.” She then clarified that it wasn’t Klobuchar who liked her tweet.

Twitter users can change their display names at any time, according to Twitter’s Help Center. Klobuchar on Dec. 15 sent a tweet congratulating Buttigieg on his nomination, saying, “Congratulations @PeteButtigieg!

The fabricated quote originates from a satirical article.   Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Dec. 11 that makes Christmas Eve a federal holiday this year. Around the same time, a lengthy quote disparaging Christmas that Harris allegedly said started making the rounds on social media, with some Facebook posts saying she made the negative comment about observing the holiday during a recent interview. “Why is Christmas held above Hamnukah (sic) or Kwanzaa? It’s a long-standing grievous error to allow Christians some kind of festival of superiority that’s forcibly pushed down the throats of others,” Harris supposedly said. “This is not a Christian nation, no matter what the leftover cult of ignoramuses that still hump their dogs over Trump think. I think it should be a one-day fete like Martin Luther King’s birthday. And he actually existed. And was American.”  There is, however, no evidence Harris made the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any national or local media outlets quoting her as making the remark, and it doesn’t appear in Rev’s collection of transcripts for Harris’ public statements. Searches of her verified Twitter accounts – @KamalaHarris and @SenKamalaHarris – and ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets also turned up no matches. The alleged quote appears to originate on the parody news website America’s Last Line of Defense, where it was published as part of a satirical article titled “Kamala : ‘Christmas Shouldn’t Be A Federal Holiday.’” America’s Last Line of Defense states on its “about us” page that “everything on this website is fiction.” (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Say, ‘Our Military Are Soulless Cowards’?) USA Today reported that Harris identifies a Baptist. She has tweeted about Christmas on numerous occasions such as Christmas Day last year, when she tweeted, “There is no greater gift than time with family, friends, and loved ones. Wishing you and yours a Merry Christmas.”  There is no greater gift than time with family, friends, and loved ones.

Fact Check: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, in a bid supported by President Donald Trump, filed the lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order to invalidate the ballots in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, alleging the four states had election procedures that violated laws, according to NBC News. The lawsuit sought to block the presidential electors for those states from voting in the Electoral College, according to The Associated Press. The Supreme Court rejected the suit on Dec. 11. The screen grabbed tweet suggests that the Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit because of how it was filed and signaled it would rehear the case if refiled differently. “In a nut case, SCOTUS rejected the TX case because TX filed their case as ‘motion for leave to file a bill of complaint,’” reads the tweet. “However, SCOTUS signals to TX and other states that if they file their cases as ‘motion to file the bill of complaint,’ then their cases will be heard.”  The tweet, however, is incorrect. In a brief order, the Supreme Court said that it denied the motion due to a “lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution” and that Texas “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.” The court did not cite how the lawsuit was filed as a reason for it being rejected in its order. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Kelly Loeffler’s House?) Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said in a statement that they believe the court does “not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.” While they said that they would have heard Texas’ complaint, they “would not grant other relief,” according to their statement. Legal experts confirmed in emails to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the screen grabbed tweet’s claim is incorrect. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet That The Supreme Court ‘Should Decide The Presidency At Every Election’?) Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, told the DNCF that “there’s no way the Supreme Court takes the Texas case even if filed in a different way,” while Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said, “I do not read [the court’s order] as rejection of the filing of the motion itself, but that the motion was defective for lack of standing (7 justices) and on merits (2 justices).” “Despite that divide over whether the Court could hear the case, the Court was unanimous in denying an early injunction that Texas sought to stop the cast of electoral college votes,” said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC Irvine School of Law. “At least 7 Justices believe that Texas does not have legal standing to be able to challenge how other states run their presidential elections – so no matter how the case would be filed, Texas would lose.” The Electoral College affirmed Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election on Monday, with electors giving the president-elect 306 electoral votes and Trump 232 electoral votes, according to USA Today.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The patients were vaccinated by the same nurse at the same hospital on Dec. 8. Fact Check:   Grandmother Margaret Keenan on Dec. 8 became the first person in the U.K. and the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial, the National Health Service said on Twitter. 81-year-old William Shakespeare was the vaccine’s second non-trial recipient, according to Newsweek. The Facebook post juxtaposes two photos: one showing Shakespeare receiving the vaccine with an LBC headline that reads: “William Shakespeare from Warwickshire First Man to Receive The COVID Vaccine,” and the other showing Keenan receiving the vaccine with text that reads, “Margaret Kennan, from Coventry, had the first coronavirus Covid-19 vaccine this morning.” The nurse administering the vaccines is the same in both pictures. In the caption, the Facebook user attempts to suggest that the photos show the nurse “in two different hospitals 200 miles apart.” Since Dec. 8, viral social media posts spreading baseless conspiracy theories suggesting that Keenan, Shakespeare and the nurse are crisis actors, according to USA Today. (RELATED: Viral Post Falsely Claims The First UK COVID-19 Vaccine Recipient Is A Crisis Actor)  While both vaccine recipients were, according to The New York Times, vaccinated by May Parsons, they were not vaccinated in hospitals 200 miles apart. Keenan and Shakespeare both received the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry, England, the Washington Post reported. Photos taken by Jacob King for The Associated Press show Parsons vaccinating Keenan and Shakespeare at the hospital on Dec. 8. The U.K. administered more than 130,000 COVID-19 vaccines in the first week of the vaccine program, BBC News reported. Vaccines in the U.K. are being offered first to populations seen as having a greater risk of dying from the disease, including care facility residents, people over 80 years old and health care workers.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=709452079998848&set=gm.386396429088653,https://twitter.com/NHSEngland/status/1336203871966912514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1336214394229940224%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fcovid-19-vaccine-pfizer-uk-first-dose-v-day%2F,https://www.newsweek.com/william-shakespeare-covid-vaccine-pfizer-worlds-second-person-approved-1553055,https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=709452079998848&set=gm.386396429088653,https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/william-shakespeare-warwickshire-second-person-covid-vaccine/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/09/coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-facebook-twitter-youtube/3867707001/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/10/fact-check-margaret-keenan-coronavirus-vaccine-recipient-crisis-actor/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/world/first-briton-to-be-vaccinated-if-i-can-have-it-at-90-then-you-can-have-it-too.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/world/william-shakespeare-covid-vaccine.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/covid-vaccine-pfizer-uk/2020/12/08/f78a8978-3676-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Not-Real-News/e7ee0b6d57e44b2c9530934c6acb6810/1/0,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Virus-Outbreak-Britain/dfc1d0be566e4ca6a564387128cff32b/7/0,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55332242,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55045639,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d191f081b021f2d0e05080e061402181f0b0c0e19430e0200",Do These Photos Show A Nurse Administering The First COVID-19 Vaccine At Two Hospitals 200 Miles Apart?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The image has been digitally manipulated to add the joint. The original image shows nothing in her hand.   Fact Check: The image, which appears to show a screen grabbed tweet written in Mandarin, shows Harris speaking at a microphone while holding a lit marijuana cigarette in her hand. The photo of Harris, however, has been digitally manipulated to add the joint in her hand. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the original photo dates back nearly six years and shows Harris gesturing without holding anything in her hand. Photographer Damian Dovarganes took the picture for The Associated Press.  “Kamala Harris, California’s attorney general keynotes the UCLA Law Review Symposium: ‘Examining the Roots of Human Trafficking and Exploitation,’ at the UCLA campus in Los Angeles Friday, Jan. 30, 2015,” reads The Associated Press’s caption of the unaltered photo. Harris discussed the state’s efforts to combat human trafficking at the symposium, according to the UCLA Law Magazine. Had she held a marijuana cigarette while onstage, it would have made headlines, yet no state or local media outlets reported that such a thing occurred. During a February 2019 interview with the radio show The Breakfast Club, Harris stated that she smoked marijuana in college and that she supports legalization of the drug.

Verdict: False The CDC said it does not deliver groceries or cleaning supplies. The phone numbers listed are for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s contact tracing staff.   Fact Check: The CDC recommends anyone who comes in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days to help curb the spread of the disease. The image on Facebook claims the CDC will deliver groceries and cleaning products twice while one is in quarantine if either of the two numbers listed in the image are called. However, the CDC does not deliver groceries and cleaning supplies to those in quarantine, according to CDC spokesperson Belsie González, who told Check Your Fact via email that such services would be “beyond the CDC’s role.” The website for the CDC does include information regarding COVID-19 safety guidelines for food and grocery delivery drivers as well as tips for food delivery safety.  The phone numbers in the image don’t connect to a CDC hotline. Check Your Fact called both numbers, which appear to be based in Philadelphia, and each played a pre-recorded message that states, “Thank you for calling the Health Center voicemail system. To access your voicemail box, press the pound sign.” James Garrow, the director of communications for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, told Check Your Fact that the phone numbers belong to the COVID containment division’s contact tracing staff, not the CDC. (RELATED: Did The CDC Admit In This Document That ‘There Is No COVID-19’?) “When someone tests positive for COVID, our contact tracers will reach out and try to connect them with services or supports if they need it,” Garrow explained in an email. “The Philadelphia Dept of Public Health does not provide those services, neither cleaning nor groceries.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/alicia.appleton/posts/3828339757190592,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html,https://www.facebook.com/alicia.appleton/posts/3828339757190592,https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/mission.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/food-grocery-drivers.html,https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/food-safety-meal-kits.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/23/fact-check-cdc-document-admit-covid-19/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#23575146554c5163404b4640485a4c5651454240570d404c4e",Does The CDC Deliver Groceries And Cleaning Supplies To People In Quarantine?,,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence Pope Francis has made such an announcement. The claim originated from the satirical website the Babylon Bee.   Fact Check: The Facebook post shows a screen grab of an article titled “Pope Francis Says Covid Vaccine Will Now Be Required to Enter Heaven.” The screen grabbed article features a picture of the pope and a stock photo of a COVID-19 vaccine. While the pope has publicly discussed COVID-19 vaccines, there is no record of him making such an announcement. Had he done so, it would have been covered by major media outlets, yet none have. The Press Office of the Holy See also has not put out a press release about it, nor has the pope tweeted anything to that effect.  The pope told the United Nations in September that the poorest members of society should get access to COVID-19 vaccines first, saying, “If anyone should be given preference, let it be the poorest, the most vulnerable, those who so often experience discrimination because they have neither power nor economic resources,” according to Reuters. The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recently started being distributed in the U.S. and other countries. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact determined that the image shows a Nov. 30 article published by the Babylon Bee, a self-described satirical website that publishes content about “Christian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life.” While the Babylon Bee clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the Facebook post fails to do so. Some Facebook users appear to have perceived the satire article as real news: one user said, “Guess I’m going to hell,” while another said, “This mf trippin.” (RELATED: Did The Lakers Wear Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg?) This isn’t the first time social media users have taken an image originating from the Babylon Bee as fact.

The false claim has circulated several times in recent years, according to a NASA spokesperson.   Fact Check: The article, titled “ALERT: NASA Confirms Earth Will Go Dark For 6 Days In December 2020,” was published on the news blog Daily Buzz Live, and claims NASA has announced the world will experience six days of total darkness due to a solar storm causing space debris to block the sun. A video of former NASA administrator Charles Bolden encouraging families to practice emergency preparedness is embedded in the article. “The world will remain dark for these 6 days, completely void of sunlight, due to a solar storm which will cause dust and space debris to block 90% of the sun,” the article reads, in part. “Bolden urges American’s (sic) to remain calm as we experience the largest solar storm our solar system has seen in 250 years.”  However, there is no record of NASA announcing six days without light between Dec. 16 and Dec. 22. If NASA had made such an announcement, media outlets would have almost certainly reported on it, yet none appear to have done so. A search of NASA’s website likewise found no announcements about an alleged solar storm blocking the sun’s light. Tabatha Thompson, a spokesperson for NASA, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the story is a hoax, noting it “has circulated off and on during the last decade” and that NASA “has not issued any statement with that false claim.” (RELATED: Did NASA Announce A 13th Zodiac Sign?) While Bolden does, in fact, tell Americans that they should have an emergency preparedness plan in the video, at no point does he mention anything about preparing for the earth to experience six days of darkness. The video, which is several years old, appears to be unrelated to the article. Bolden is no longer the NASA administrator, as the article claims. He was the administrator from July 2009 until he resigned in January 2017, according to his biography on NASA’s website.

Verdict: False There is no record of Trump sending or deleting the tweet. It appears to be fabricated.   Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared the image of the supposed Dec. 14 tweet from Trump that talks about a possible pardon for Cosby. One user sharing the image called it a “slap in the face for the COSBY Victims.” “Among others, I am considering a FULL PARDON for America’s Dad, the great Bill Cosby who is in all likelihood totally innocent,” reads the alleged tweet. “Sad we live in a country where great men like ‘Dr’ Cosby are in prison and crooked Hillary is not!” (RELATED: Did Elizabeth Trump Grau Send This Tweet In Support Of Her Brother, Donald Trump?)  In 2018, Cosby, who has denied wrongdoing, was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in 2004, according to CNN. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Dec. 1 heard the former actor’s appeal about the trial judge’s decision to allow the testimony of five other accusers during his 2018 trial, The Associated Press reported. There is no evidence Trump tweeted that he is considering granting Cosby a pardon. A search of his Twitter accounts – @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – turned up no matches. ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets also shows no record of him deleting it. Had Trump tweeted such a thing, major media outlets would have covered it, yet none have.  The tweet appears to be fabricated. Trump most recently on Nov. 25 pardoned his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, according to the Justice Department’s list of his pardons. Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding his communications with a former Russian ambassador but had since sought to withdraw the plea, Reuters reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/allen.gonzalez.585/posts/3530566017021804,https://www.facebook.com/allen.gonzalez.585/posts/3530566017021804,https://www.facebook.com/allen.gonzalez.585/posts/3530566017021804,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/23/fact-check-elizabeth-trump-grau-tweet-support-donald-trump-parody/,https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/24/us/bill-cosby-fast-facts/index.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pennsylvania-supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-bill-cosby-appeal/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22bill%20cosby%22%20(from%3ArealDonaldTrump%20OR%20from%3APOTUS)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump,https://news.google.com/search?q=trump%20pardon%20bill%20cosby&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://archive.vn/Zzu3g,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-flynn/trump-pardons-former-adviser-flynn-who-pleaded-guilty-in-russia-probe-idUSKBN28536B,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#186c6a7d6e776a587b707d7b7361776d6a7e797b6c367b7775",Did Trump Tweet That He Is ‘Considering A Full Pardon’ For Bill Cosby?,,,,,,

Biden was actually giving a hypothetical example of an issue the Supreme Court could rule on in the future as part of his argument that broader interpretation of the Constitution is needed to protect people’s rights, including the right to privacy.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a Dec. 11 tweet from former Republican Georgia congressional candidate Angela Stanton-King. The tweet contains a clip of Biden speaking during a 2005 confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. “Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person’s body to track his every movement?” Biden asks in part. “There is actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.” (RELATED: Does HR 6666 Require Microchips To Be Secretly Implanted During COVID-19 Tests?)  The social media posts attempt to use the clip as evidence that Biden confirmed an “agenda to microchip the masses” 15 years ago. However, after reviewing the transcript of the 2005 confirmation hearing, the Daily Caller News Foundation found Biden was not announcing a supposed “agenda” for microchipping people. The then-senator instead brought up a “microscopic tag” as a futuristic hypothetical example of an issue Roberts and the other Supreme Court justices could one day have to rule on. Immediately after that remark, Biden put forward another hypothetical scenario, saying, “Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior? You will rule on that,” according to C-SPAN footage of the hearing. At no point during Biden’s questioning of Roberts does Biden express support for microchipping the masses, the transcript of the hearing shows. The two hypothetical examples came amid a larger argument Biden made that broader interpretation of the Constitution is needed to protect people’s rights such as privacy. “Like the Founders, I believe our Constitution is as big and as grand and as great as its people,” Biden said. “Our constitutional journey did not stop with women being barred from being lawyers, with 10-yearolds working in coal mines, or with black kids forced into different schools than white kids, just because in the Constitution nowhere does it mention sex discrimination, child labor, segregation. It does not mention it. Our constitutional journey did not stop then, and it must not stop now, Judge.” The internet is replete with baseless claims about supposed plans to microchip large groups of people. Check Your Fact has previously debunked social media posts making allegations ranging from White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci saying every American should be microchipped to a House bill requiring microchips to be secretly implanted inside people during COVID-19 tests.

Verdict: False The video shows a pair of contestants performing a waltz during a dance competition show in the U.K.   Fact Check: Dancing robots have been used for entertainment in Japan. The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks baseball team placed over 20 dancing robots in the stands during a July game in lieu of fans due to COVID-19 restrictions, according to Reuters. Social media users have shared a video that they claim shows Chinese robots ballroom dancing, with captions attempting to compare the alleged robots in the video to Japanese dancing robots. (RELATED: Does This Video Show The Fireworks Display Meant For The Tokyo Olympics?)  One such caption reads, “This classical dance was created in China and broadcast at Shanghai Disneyland. They are not dance artists, but robots made in China. The performance time is only about 5 minutes, but the waiting time for tickets is 4 hours, and the ticket price is 499 yuan.($75) It is more complex than Japan’s, and has perfect facial expressions. Both dancers are robots. They look so real that they cannot be distinguished from actual people.” The dancers, however, are human. The BBC posted the video on YouTube in December 2013 with the title “Abbey Clancy & Aljaz dance the Viennesse Waltz to ‘Delilah’ – Strictly Come Dancing – BBC One.” The people pictured in the video are model Abbey Clancy and professional dancer Aljaz Skorjanec. The pair won the dance competition show “Strictly Come Dancing” in 2013, according to The Guardian. The show airs on BBC One.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/beverly.h.saari/posts/10158804368766420,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baseball-japan-robots/dancing-robots-replace-fans-at-japanese-baseball-game-idUSKBN24919D,https://www.facebook.com/beverly.h.saari/posts/10158804368766420,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/08/20/fact-check-fireworks-display-tokyo-olympics/,https://www.facebook.com/beverly.h.saari/posts/10158804368766420,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpcAIFNVFfM&feature=emb_title,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2325706/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2bdDcTsZ6sLvynF1gGwmxjy/alja-skorjanec,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/21/strictly-come-dancing-2013-abbey-clancy-win,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m8dq,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#71050314071e0331121914121a081e0403171012055f121e1c",Does This Video Show Chinese Dancing Robots?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Images of the patient’s vaccination weren’t published before Dec. 8, a reverse image search shows. The claim appears to have stemmed from people seeing the clip appear in the video player embedded in the old CNN article when they accessed the article after Dec. 8.   Fact Check: Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother, became the first person in the U.K. and the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial on Dec. 8, according to the National Health Service. Since receiving the vaccine, Keenan has been the subject of several baseless conspiracy theories, USA Today reported. This particular post uses two screen grabs – one of an Oct. 22 CNN article and one of a Dec. 8 BBC News article – to falsely allege that images of Keenan receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were published by CNN before her vaccination took place. The screen grab of the CNN article shows a still from a video depicting Keenan receiving the injection.  “Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the ‘first to get vaccinated’ today in BBC photo… also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, with the exact same nurse, getting a shot back in November?” reads the caption. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims A Vaccine Stored At -80 Degrees ‘Isn’t A Vaccine’ And Is Meant For ‘Genetic Manipulation’) The CNN clip that the screen grab shows first aired on Dec. 8, the same day Keenan got the vaccine, according to the video clip editing service Grabien. The Oct. 22 CNN story covers a report that estimated between 130,000 and 210,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. could have been prevented if the federal government’s pandemic response had been different. The article does not mention Keenan or include any photos of her. CNN embeds a video player below the headlines in some articles that allows users to watch videos about different, often recent news stories. The claim likely stemmed from people seeing the clip appear in the video player embedded in the old article when they accessed the article after Dec. 8. Versions of the Oct. 22 CNN story archived in October and November do not show the video of Keenan in the video player. In a Tineye reverse image search, Check Your Fact didn’t find any record of images of Keenan receiving the vaccine being published before Dec. 8.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/dana.w.jones.7/posts/10224055375070218,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/17/covid-vaccines-what-you-need-to-know/?arc404=true,https://twitter.com/NHSEngland/status/1336203871966912514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1336214394229940224%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fcovid-19-vaccine-pfizer-uk-first-dose-v-day%2F,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/09/coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-facebook-twitter-youtube/3867707001/,https://www.facebook.com/dana.w.jones.7/posts/10224055375070218,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/health/covid-response-deaths-columbia-report/index.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55227325,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/08/fact-check-vaccines-negative-80-degrees-transfection-agents-infect-cells/,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/12/08/uk-first-coronavirus-vaccination-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/around-the-world/,https://grabien.com/getmedia.php?id=1125235&key=3eec5138a2b6f03f2c36bb4104ba3ea6,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/health/covid-response-deaths-columbia-report/index.html,https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/health/covid-response-deaths-columbia-report/index.html,https://tineye.com/search/519be3407c82b8679deab58f41b123865d52d989?sort=crawl_date&order=asc&page=1,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#493d3b2c3f263b092a212c2a2230263c3b2f282a3d672a2624",Did CNN Publish Images Of The First UK COVID-19 Vaccine Recipient In October?,,,,,,

Fact Check:  The Facebook image shows a screen grab of a tweet showing four stills from an alleged interview with GoFundMe’s CEO. “I run a website that hosts popularity contests where if you lose, you die,” the person being interviewed is quoted as saying. “Would you be doing all right?” However, the man being interviewed is not actually the CEO of GoFundMe. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image actually comes from a comedy sketch posted by the parody YouTube channel College Humor in 2019, not a genuine interview with Cadogan.   The sketch identifies Dan Spoon as GoFundMe’s CEO, but in reality, Rob Solomon was the CEO of GoFundMe when the skit was released. Cadogan became the current CEO of the company in March. Neither Cadogan nor Solomon bear any physical resemblance to the man in the interview with Cadogan being bald and Solomon having dark brown hair, unlike Spoon who has red hair. The skit is seemingly based on comments made by Solomon. In January 2019, then-CEO Solomon told CBS News that 33 percent of the campaigns on GoFundMe go towards raising money for medical care, though that was not the original purpose of the website. (RELATED: Did Kayleigh McEnany Give Lesley Stahl A Blank Book Of The Trump Administration’s Healthcare Achievements?) “When we started in 2010, it wasn’t purposefully set up and built to be a substitute for medical insurance,” Solomon said. “We weren’t ever set up to be a health care company and we still are not. But over time, people have used GoFundMe for the most important issues they are faced with.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:   The image shared on Facebook appears to show a screen grab of a Dec. 5 tweet from Obama that features an image of him shaking hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hand. “Today I am shamefull for a hand shake with this man… #Narenda Modi,” reads the accompanying text. In recent months, farmers across India have been protesting new agricultural laws that they believe will be damaging to their industry, according to the Washington Post. The Indian government is facing increasing pressure to change the new laws as support for the farmers continues to grow, Bloomberg reported. There is, however, no evidence that Obama ever sent such a tweet. U.S. politicians, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have been mentioned in news reports for their support of the Indian farmers. Had Obama tweeted his regret for shaking Modi’s hand, media outlets would have almost certainly reported on it, yet none have. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet, ‘Ask Ukraine If They Found My Birth Certificate’?)  The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Obama’s verified Twitter account, @BarackObama, but found no such tweet. Archived screen grabs of Obama’s Twitter profile on Dec. 5, the day the alleged tweet was sent, and Dec. 6 likewise show no similar remarks. While there is no record of Obama sending or deleting the tweet, the image of the two men shaking hands is authentic. It was taken during Modi’s 2014 visit to the White House and was published by The Economic Times.

There is no evidence that 200,349 absentee ballots were invalidated in Allegheny County.   Fact Check: The image shows a Parler post, purportedly from former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, that reads, “BREAKING: Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge ruled that 200,349 absentee ballots in Allegheny County where the voter didn’t date their declaration are invalid, reversing a lower court judge. This is a Trump win. He just won Pennsylvania again!” Powell, who has claimed the election was stolen, has filed lawsuits in battleground states challenging election results that have been thrown out by the courts, according to The Associated Press. The Parler post did not come from her account. While the account bears her name and picture, it lacks the “verified influencer” badge that her real account, @SidneyPowell, has.  The claim within the Parler post doesn’t hold up either. It inaccurately asserts that the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed a previous court decision and ruled that over 200,000 absentee ballots shall not be counted due to voters not dating them, when in reality it pertained to only 2,349 ballots that were ultimately included in the county’s tally. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania on Nov. 19 reversed a Nov. 18 ruling from the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas and asked the Common Pleas court to direct the county to exclude the 2,349 ballots lacking dates from the county’s tally, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. However, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the Common Pleas court decision, allowing the ballots to be counted, Forbes reported. The Common Pleas court judge had said on Nov. 18 that the 2,349 ballots “must be counted” despite the technical defect, according to local NPR station WESA. “In November, the PA Supreme Court permitted the counting of 2,349 ballots in the county that were submitted without a written date on the outside, but were otherwise correct and delivered on time,” Amie Downs, a spokesperson for Allegheny County, said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims More Mail-In Ballots Were Returned Than Requested In Pennsylvania) Pennsylvania certified its presidential election results on Nov. 24, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. President-elect Joe Biden received 3,458,229 votes, while President Donald Trump received 3,377,674 votes, according to a press release from the Pennsylvania government.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Keenan, a retired jewelry store assistant, is a crisis actor. The post includes photos of two other women that are noticeably younger than Keenan.   Fact Check: The viral post features images of Keenan receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, a woman falling to the ground and a woman’s StarNow acting profile that the Facebook user presents as evidence Keenan is a crisis actor. Keenan, a 90-year-old retired U.K. jewelry store assistant, became the first person in the U.K. and the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial on Dec. 8, according to a National Health Service (NHS) press release. There is, however, no evidence Keenan is a crisis actor. The caption falsely suggests that the women pictured are the same, despite that not being the case. (RELATED: Does This Video Show An Anti-Lockdown Protest In London?)  Liz Scott, the woman shown in the StarNow profile, is visibly younger than Keenan. Scott’s profile lists her as having brown eyes, while a video from The Guardian and a photo tweeted by the NHS shows Keenan has blue eyes. Keenan lives in Coventry, a city that is roughly 100 miles from London, where Scott lists herself as living on her StarNow profile.  Meet Maggie: the first person in the world to receive a fully-tested and approved Covid-19 vaccine on the NHS. pic.twitter.com/eb2ijTMSLW — NHS England and NHS Improvement (@NHSEngland) December 8, 2020  The photo of the woman falling down comes from September 2020, when protesters gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to protest against vaccination and government COVID-19 restrictions, according to a photo from Agence France-Presse. The woman appears noticeably younger than Keenan, who advised for “anyone offered the vaccine is to take it” in an NHS press release. Check Your Fact also found no major British media outlets reporting that Keenan works as a “crisis actor.” Keenan has been the target of a number of baseless conspiracy theories since receiving her COVID-19 vaccination, according to Vice.

Verdict: False The footage is actually from a protest in response to a new security bill and shows a branch of the Bank of France in flames.   Fact Check: The members of Rothschild family, who have been influential in international banking for centuries, have long been the target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, the Washington Post reported. English and French Rothschild family members control Rothschild Co., which is described on its website as “one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory groups.” The short video in the Nov. 28 Facebook post shows what appears to be a crowd of people standing in front of a building while it burns. The caption reads, “The Rothschild Bank in Paris is on fire. The time is up for the 1% They have controlled this world for too long. The protestors have finally got the right target.”  Protests have occurred throughout France since Nov. 28 in response to a proposed security law that would prohibit civilians from publishing photos of on-duty police officers, “with the intent to harm their ‘physical or psychological integrity,'” BBC News reported. There is no indication that the Rothschild family had any involvement in the protests. The logo in the corner of the video is that of the Russian state-funded Sputnik news agency. It appears the footage comes from a Nov. 28 YouTube livestream posted by Sputnik titled, “Protests Against ‘Global Security’ Bill Continue in Paris.” The description of the livestream does not mention the Rothschild family or bank at all, reading, “Article 24 of the bill, which has come under especial criticism as it makes it illegal to distribute videos and photos identifying law enforcement officers and thereby violate their ‘physical or mental integrity,’ was approved by the parliament, against the backdrop of demonstrations over the past week.” The bank in the video can be seen on Google Maps and is actually a branch of the Bank of France, not a Rothschild bank, located in Paris’ Place de la Bastille. The letters “BF” are visibly displayed on the building in many places. (RELATED: Were 7 Antifa Members Arrested In Medford, Oregon For Starting The Wildfires?) “The fire that took place on November 28th took place in one of our branches, and is not a Rothschild bank,” the Bank of France’s press office told Check Your Fact via email. “The Banque de France is a member of the Eurosystem, which groups together the European Central Bank and the national central banks of all countries that have adopted the euro.

Verdict: False The little boy in the picture has been misidentified. A spokesperson for BioNTech confirmed the photo does not show Sahin’s family.   Fact Check: Sahin, an immunologist and cancer researcher, and his wife Dr. Özlem Türeci, co-founded BioNTech, a German company that recently announced that it has jointly developed with Pfizer a COVID-19 vaccine, according to The Guardian. He immigrated to Germany from Turkey with his parents as a young child, The Associated Press reported. “Turkish immigrant family just arrived in Germany,” reads text above the image. “Ugur, the little lad in the yellow top, went on to develop the Pfizer vaccine that’s going to be rolled out in the UK this week.”  While the picture does appear to show a photo of a Turkish family that immigrated to Germany, it is not Sahin’s family. The pictured boy in the yellow shirt is not Sahin. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Kelly Loeffler’s House?) A reverse image search reveals the picture was taken by German photographer Candida Höfer and was first published in 1979. It can be found in a collection of Höfer’s photographs, titled “Türken in Deutschland.” Neither the photo’s description nor the “Türken in Deutschland” collection identify the people pictured. “This is not a picture of Prof. Sahin’s family,” said Julia Bloes, a spokesperson for BioNTech, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. The Twitter account @DiasporaTürk, an account dedicated to profiling the experience of Turkish immigrants across Europe in the 20th century, tweeted about the picture in August claiming it was taken in the German city of Düsseldorf in the 70s. DiasporaTürk told the DCNF in a Twitter direct message that a member of the family in the picture had contacted them and told them that the boy in the picture is currently a “factory worker in his 50s,” not a scientist. The account later addressed people misidentifying the boy in a Nov. 17 tweet.  Bugün birçok yerde fotoğraftaki erkek çocuğunun Prof.Dr. Uğur Şahin olduğuyla ilgili paylaşımlar yapıldı.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The antifa membership card is fabricated. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be the 34th president’s supposed lifetime membership card to the organization “Global Antifascism Initiative.” It features a portrait of Eisenhower in military attire and lists the alleged date he joined the organization as Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. There is no evidence the membership card is genuine. The fabricated card appears to play on Eisenhower having a key role in the Allied Powers defeating the fascist Axis Powers led by Nazi Germany during World War II. The modern antifa movement is an “umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations,” according to The Associated Press. It lacks official leaders and is organized into local cells, the outlet reported.  The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any record of the “Global Antifascism Initiative” existing. Experts confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the membership card is fake. (RELATED: Did A DOJ Investigation Find That Barack Obama And George Soros Created Antifa?) “There was no such thing, and, even if there was, Eisenhower was working day and night in the Pentagon,” Chester Pach, a history professor at Ohio University and the co-author of “The Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower,” told the DCNF in an email. “Eisenhower didn’t even vote while he was in uniform because he believed that any political activity was inappropriate for a career military officer.” “That picture – which they altered – was taken when he was a five-star General of the Army,” Tim Rives, deputy director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home, said in an email. “He was not promoted to that rank until Dec. 20, 1944.” Photographer Yousuf Karsh took the picture of Eisenhower in 1946, according to Karsh’s website. In the fake membership card, the five stars seem to have been removed from his hat.

No candidate has ever won both Florida and Ohio and lost. I won them both, by a lot! #SupremeCourt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 9, 2020  Verdict: False Richard Nixon lost his 1960 presidential bid to John F. Kennedy despite winning both Florida and Ohio.   Fact Check:  Trump made the claim in a Dec. 9 tweet, saying, “No candidate has ever won both Florida and Ohio and lost. I won them both, by a lot! #Supreme Court.” The tweet, which has been retweeted over 39,000 times as of press time, is inaccurate. Nixon, who would later serve as president from 1969 to 1974, won the two states in 1960 but ultimately lost the election to Kennedy, Newsweek reported. In the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy won 303 electoral votes, while Nixon won 219, according to the National Archives. (RELATED: Viral Video Falsely Claims To Show A Technician Manipulating Voting Data In Georgia)  Trump is the first presidential candidate since Nixon in 1960 to win both Ohio and Florida but still lose the election, according to electoral maps from 270 to Win. 2020 presidential election results from NBC News show President-elect Joe Biden receiving 306 electoral votes and Trump receiving 232. The president has made numerous baseless claims about widespread voter fraud, despite Attorney General William Barr saying in early December that the Justice Department has found no evidence widespread fraud occurred, according to The Associated Press. In a joint statement, the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council also said there is “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Electoral College electors are set to cast their votes on Dec. 14, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump, “You can either accept defeat and have unity with us Or you can have war.”  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez made such a statement.   Fact Check: Ocasio-Cortez, who was re-elected as the representative for New York’s 14th Congressional District in November, has previously voiced her support of President-elect Joe Biden, according to Bloomberg. The Associated Press called the 2020 presidential election for the former vice president on Nov. 7. A post on Facebook alleges to share a comment made by Ocasio-Cortez telling Republicans to “accept defeat and have unity with us.” (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Joe Biden Wearing His Walking Boot On The Wrong Foot)  “Here’s the deal MAGAtards and ppl,” Ocasio-Cortez allegedly said. “You can either accept defeat and have unity with us Or you can have war Cause if Boden (sic) isn’t in that White House by January 20th then its (sic) going to be all bad Make your decisions wisely and think about what you’re doing This is for all Republicans in general.” However, there is no record of Ocasio-Cortez making such a remark. Had she made a remark threatening war against Republicans, media outlets would have almost assuredly reported on it, yet none appear to have done so. The comment likewise does not appear on her websites nor in any of her social media posts. Check Your Fact also searched Propublica’s archive of politicians’ deleted tweets, but found no instances of the quote. Other iterations of the claim show a screen grab of a Nov. 25 post on the internet forum 4chan sharing the comment along with a photo of Ocasio-Cortez. While 4chan shows that the post was posted by “Anonymous,” some social media users have shared the post on Facebook, seemingly believing that it showed a genuine statement from the congresswoman.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/polly.carvalho.90/posts/2784381001880115,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/nyregion/ny-house-aoc.html,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/494275-ocasio-cortez-says-she-will-vote-for-biden-in-november,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/ocasio-cortez-says-young-voters-are-pragmatic-will-back-biden,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/07/fact-check-joe-biden-walking-boot-left-right-wrong-foot-major-dog/,https://www.facebook.com/polly.carvalho.90/posts/2784381001880115,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&ei=bu_QX_v0L6SD5wLLvp1Q&q=Ocasio-Cortez+%22You+can+either+accept+defeat+and+have+unity+with+us+Or+you+can+have+war%22%22&oq=Ocasio-Cortez+%22You+can+either+accept+defeat+and+have+unity+with+us+Or+you+can+have+war%22%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1CctwNYm8YDYLLJA2gDcAB4AIABvwGIAfwCkgEDMC4ymAEAoAECoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwj749DLncHtAhWkwVkKHUtfBwoQ4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=safari&rls=en&ei=NerPX9aLN_zP0PEP57yHmA4&q=%22This+is+for+all+Republicans+in+general%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Focasio-cortez.house.gov+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocasiocortez.com&oq=%22This+is+for+all+Republicans+in+general%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Focasio-cortez.house.gov+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocasiocortez.com&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoFCCEQoAE6BQghEKsCUNPWB1i2kxBg3JgQaAZwAHgBgAFZiAHWDJIBAjI0mAEEoAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiW-pO8pL_tAhX8JzQIHWfeAeMQ4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22This%20is%20for%20all%20Republicans%20in%20general%22%20(from%3AAOC%20OR%20from%3ARepAOC)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/389432195138655/search/?q=%22This%20is%20for%20all%20Republicans%20in%20general%22,https://www.facebook.com/page/1316372698453411/search/?q=%22This%20is%20for%20all%20Republicans%20in%20general%22,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=You+can+either+accept+defeat+and+have+unity+with+us+Or+you+can+have+war,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3497847823625545&set=a.270966739647019&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=132553081974842&set=a.115380367025447&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=715019179452061&set=a.103324333954885&type=3&theater,https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/293073000/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9eeaecfbe8f1ecdefdf6fbfdf5e7f1ebecf8fffdeab0fdf1f3",Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tell Republicans They Can Either ‘Accept Defeat’ Or ‘Have War’?,,,,,,

Fact Check: Trump announced in a Dec. 6 tweet that Giuliani had tested positive for COVID-19, stating, “@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus.” Giuliani appeared to confirm this in a tweet later that day, writing that he is “getting great care and feeling good.” Screen grabs of an alleged tweet sent by Giuliani in October have been shared countless times on social media in response to his positive coronavirus test. The purported tweet reads: “I think it’s highly likely that all these people that have contracted the China Virus got it from having sex with barnyard animals.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Real Tweet Rudy Giuliani Sent About Dominion Voting Systems?)  However, there is no record of Giuliani actually sending the tweet. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his verified Twitter account, @RudyGiuliani, as well as ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets, but found no comments resembling the tweet. Had Giuliani sent such a tweet, media outlets would have almost certainly reported on it, yet no such reports appear to exist. This is not the first time a fake Giuliani tweet has spread on social media. In November, Check Your Fact debunked the false claim that he sent a tweet that reads, “I have substantial evidence of fraud and I can confirm that we have Dominion in our hands and are analyzing the logs.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Kelly Loeffler wearing a wire during a recent debate with Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock.   Kelly Loeffler is wearing a wire!!! pic.twitter.com/zn98HaUCq7 — Mystery Solvent (@MysterySolvent) December 7, 2020  Verdict: False   The “wire” appears to be a strand of Loeffler’s hair. The Atlanta Press Club said neither candidate had “audio assistance” during the debate. Fact Check: Since the Dec. 6 debate between Loeffler and Warnock, Facebook users have been sharing screen grabs of a tweet that features a red circle indicating where Loeffler is allegedly wearing a wire. Twitter users also posted similar images. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Tweet About Trying To Get An Instagram Post Removed After It Alleged He Wore A Wire?)  Check Your Fact reviewed footage of the debate and found no visual evidence that Loeffler was wearing a wire. Photos of the Georgia senator participating in the debate from Reuters also do not show a wire. The alleged wire circled in the images being shared online appears to actually be a strand of Loeffler’s hair.  Several journalists such as BuzzFeed News’ Craig Silverman and CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan pointed out that the claim was inaccurate on Twitter. Business Insider senior politics reporter Grace Panetta noted in a tweet that Loeffler “pretty clearly has highlights.” The Atlanta Press Club, which hosted the debate, denied any candidate had “audio assistance.”  The candidates in last night’s @atlpressclub debates had no audio assistance from their campaigns. — Atlanta Press Club (@atlpressclub) December 7, 2020  “The candidates in last night’s @atlpressclub debates had no audio assistance from their campaigns,” the Atlanta Press Club tweeted. This isn’t the first time social media users have falsely claimed photos showed a political candidate wearing a wire during a debate. Check Your Fact previously found that photos from the first presidential debate showed a crease in President-elect Joe Biden’s shirt and a set of rosary beads that he has been known to wear, not a wire.

It’s a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material.” The tweet goes on to claim that the vaccine will aid in the “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale.” The tweet appears to be in reference to the pharmaceutical company Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, which needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, according to NPR. The vaccine developed by Moderna is also stored at a frozen temperature, minus 20 degrees Celsius, but can also keep for a month at refrigerator temperatures, according to The Washington Post.  Many vaccines are stored at just above freezing, while some require much colder temperatures, a vaccine storage chart published by the American Academy of Pediatrics reports. For instance, the Ebola vaccine was stored at about minus 80 degrees Celsius, according to the World Health Organization. Dr. Warner Greene, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines must be stored at “ultra-low temperatures” because they have components that are “fragile and sensitive to degradation.” “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are RNA based (a new type of vaccine platform never used to fight infectious disease before),” Greene said in an email. “Because the RNA component is fragile and sensitive to degradation, the vaccines must be stored at ultra- low temperatures (especially true for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine).” Transfection is a biological term that refers to a technique used to “insert foreign nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) into a cell, typically with the intention of altering the properties of the cell,” according to Encyclopedia Britannica. While Greene explained that the vaccine could be considered a transfection agent in the “broadest sense,” it is inaccurate to suggest that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are designed for “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale.” “An individual’s DNA is completely unaffected by this type of vaccine,” he told the DCNF. “The vaccine introduces an RNA not a DNA. The RNA is never converted into DNA, rather it binds to ribosomes and is quickly translated into protein. The RNA actually doesn’t survive for long but just long enough to produce enough protein to direct the immune response to begin making antibodies and T cells reactive with SARS-CoV-2 Spike.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has likewise stated that the COVID-19 vaccines will not affect the recipient’s DNA. (RELATED: Does The WHO No Longer Recommend Isolation, Quarantine Or Social Distancing For COVID-19?)   “mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus and do not carry a risk of causing disease in the vaccinated person,” reads a statement on a section of the CDC website dedicated to information about the new COVID-19 vaccines. “mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA.” The CDC website also states that “COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.” Other measures the CDC recommends include wearing face coverings in certain settings and social distancing.

Verdict: False The bus was transporting office equipment purchased at a surplus sale, according to the Buckeye Police Department. A spokesperson for the Arizona Secretary of State’s office confirmed the post’s claim is inaccurate.   Fact Check: The image shows four people examining the inside of a yellow school bus from its open back door. Text overlaying the image reads, “Abandoned school bus found in Arizona filled with voting machines, windows were all blackened.” Some social media users making the claim also suggested the bus and the voting machines allegedly found within are related to election fraud; others alleged the discovery specifically occurred in Buckeye. Allegations of election fraud, many of which Check Your Fact has debunked, have circulated widely on social media since Election Day.  The Buckeye Police Department said in a Dec. 4 Facebook post that the bus was “full of office equipment purchased at a surplus sale, complete with invoices and receipts.” The department’s statement also noted that it and an investigator from the Attorney General’s office responded to the “suspicious bus.” Accompanying the statement is the same photograph being shared on social media.  Sophia Solis, a spokesperson for the Arizona Secretary of State’s office, also confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation: “This is absolutely false.” (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) The claim that the bus was “filled with voting machines” may have stemmed from a version of the post that includes two other pictures, one of which shows a sticker affixed to a machine inside the bus that bears the logo for the company Election Systems and Software and encourages people to call a specific number “For Printer Support.” “The item seen in the photo is not a voting machine or tabulation machine,” said Katina Granger, a spokesperson for Election Systems and Software, in an email to the DCNF. “The label you see in the photo is affixed to a printer.” The Associated Press projected President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential race in Arizona on Nov. 4.

Kelly Loeffler’s house.  Verdict: False While Loeffler does own two homes in Georgia, the pictured house isn’t one of them. Public property records show the mansion belongs to comedian Steve Harvey.   Fact Check: The claim that the pictured home belongs to Loeffler has circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter in recent days. Loeffler is vying to keep her Senate seat in the January runoff election against Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock, according to CNN. Check Your Fact determined the location of the sprawling mansion through a reverse image search. The house, located in Fulton County, currently belongs to Harvey, public property records show. He purchased the home for $15 million earlier this year, according to Business Insider.  Previous owners of the pictured home include entrepreneur and evangelist David Turner and actor Tyler Perry, Variety reported. The seven-bedroom house has a pool, tennis court, billiards room and wine cellar, among other amenities, according to the Los Angeles Times. (RELATED: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?) Loeffler owns two homes in Georgia: a 15,000-square-foot estate in Atlanta and another house along the coast, Forbes reported in August. She and her husband, Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher, also have three homes in Florida and a condo in Chicago, according to the outlet. Forbes estimated that Loeffler and Sprecher are worth at least $800 million and referred to her as likely to be the “richest politician on Capitol Hill.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ginandtacos/photos/a.395858276676/10158356929716677/,https://www.facebook.com/ginandtacos/photos/a.395858276676/10158356929716677/,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/georgia-senate-debate-loeffler-warnock/index.html,https://www.11alive.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/the-a-scene/tyler-perry-mansion-sold/85-d0e0bee9-1bb8-41b1-b1e9-59ffaa8af00b,https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/05/26/former-tyler-perry-estate-on-paces-ferry-sold.html,https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/4110-Paces-Ferry-Rd-NW-Atlanta-GA-30327/82617438_zpid/,http://iaspublicaccess.fultoncountyga.gov/Datalets/Datalet.aspx?sIndex=6&idx=1,https://www.businessinsider.com/tyler-perry-billionaire-career-makes-spends-billion-dollar-fortune-2020-9#he-sold-the-home-to-david-turner-an-entrepreneur-and-evangelist-nine-years-later-in-2016-for-175-million-steve-harvey-bought-the-house-for-15-million-in-june-2020-19,https://variety.com/2020/dirt/entertainers/steve-harvey-buys-tyler-perrys-15-million-former-atlanta-mansion-1234622557/,https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-06-03/steve-harvey-drops-15-million-on-tyler-perrys-gigantic-former-mansion,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/09/fact-check-did-steve-harvey-author-this-pro-trump-statement/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2020/08/03/the-richest-politician-on-capitol-hill-is-likely-georgias-recently-appointed-controversial-senator-kelly-loeffler/?sh=1baf1abd17a3,https://ir.theice.com/governance/executive-management-team/default.aspx,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2020/08/03/the-richest-politician-on-capitol-hill-is-likely-georgias-recently-appointed-controversial-senator-kelly-loeffler/?sh=1baf1abd17a3,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2020/08/03/the-richest-politician-on-capitol-hill-is-likely-georgias-recently-appointed-controversial-senator-kelly-loeffler/?sh=1baf1abd17a3,https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/factchat/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#295d5b4c5f465b694a414c4a4250465c5b4f484a5d074a4644",Does This Photo Show Kelly Loeffler’s House?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The top image appears to come from a video filmed in Pennsylvania. The women pictured in that image have been misidentified and are actually county employees, according to an Allegheny County spokesperson.   Fact Check: The Facebook post includes two images: the top one shows women near Postal Service boxes seemingly counting ballots, while the bottom image shows Parent and Jordan sitting next to each other during a Dec. 3 Georgia State Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on alleged election fraud. “Elena Parent who is Chairman of GA Senate Democrats & Senator Jen Jordan of GA 6th District of Fulton Co. Fulton Co received 6mil in private grants without authority of the state legislature!” the image’s caption reads. “Both counting ballots and also at the hearing, Elena cried when she found out CCTV recorded them!”  The women in the top picture, however, are not Parent and Jordan. The image appears to be a still from a video published by The Associated Press Nov. 7 with the caption, “Various poll workers counting ballots in an Allegheny County warehouse.” Amie Downs, an Allegheny County spokesperson, told Check Your Fact via email that the Facebook post’s claim was “not even close to being accurate” and identified both women pictured as county employees. She also noted that the “only people working in our warehouse were folks employed by the county.” Location tags on Parent’s tweets on Nov. 7 and all throughout the week after the Nov. 3 election show she was in Georgia. For example, one Nov. 7 tweet shows that she was tweeting from Atlanta, Georgia, and a Nov. 3 tweet shows she was tweeting from Druid Hills, Georgia. While Jordan’s tweets are not tagged with a location, nearly every tweet she sent between Nov. 3 and Nov. 7 was about Georgia’s elections. In emails to Check Your Fact, Parent and Jordan denied being shown in the top image and processing Pennsylvania ballots. (RELATED: Explaining The Viral Video Claiming To Show Election Fraud In Fulton County, Georgia) “This is an entirely false rumor,” Parent said. “I was not in Pennsylvania at any point during election season and I have never counted ballots during a state or national election in my life.” “The woman pictured processing votes in Pennsylvania is not me,” Jordan said. “I was in the state of Georgia on election day. I was running for reelection and was on the ballot in Georgia.” Georgia law states that “no poll officer shall be eligible for any nomination for public office or to be voted for at a primary or election at which the poll officer shall serve.” It also states that “no person who is otherwise holding public office, other than a political party office, shall be eligible to be appointed as or to serve as a poll officer.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence thousands of ballots were found in Lake Erie. The claim originated from a satirical article.   Fact Check: The Facebook user making the claim posted an image in the comments section of the Dec. 5 post that includes a link to an article published on the website Patrio Hat. The headline of the article reads, “Thousands of Ballots Found Floating In The Lake In Erie, Pennsylvania.” “THIS IS IMPORTANT: Google scrubbed searches for this… 3000 ballots floating in Lake Erie PA,” the Facebook user wrote. “Only findable on duck duck go. MASSIVE VOTE/ELECTION Fraud is rampant.”  There is, however, no evidence thousands of ballots were found floating in Lake Erie off the coast of Pennsylvania. Had such a thing occurred, it would have been widely covered by the media, yet searching on Google and DuckDuckGo turned up no reporting from major news outlets. The Department of Justice and the FBI, which the article cites as investigating the alleged incident, have also not put out any press releases mentioning anything to that effect. A discovery of ballots discarded in such a manner would likely prompt a statement from the Erie County Board of Elections as well. (RELATED: Viral Video Falsely Claims To Show A Technician Manipulating Voting Data In Georgia) The Patrio Hat article appears to have been originally published on the website America’s Last Line of Defense, a parody news website that describes itself as creating “satire for your confirmation bias.” While America’s Last Line of Defense clearly disclaims that “everything on this website is fiction,” some websites republished the satirical story as if it were real, a common way misinformation spreads online. U.S. Attorney General William Barr stated in early December that the Department of Justice found no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the election’s outcome, The Associated Press reported. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also issued a joint Nov. 12 statement from the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council that said there is “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/joeboscogolf/posts/10223108969219894,https://www.facebook.com/joeboscogolf/posts/10223108969219894,https://patriothat.com/thousands-of-ballots-found-floating-in-the-lake-in-erie-pennsylvania/,https://patriothat.com/thousands-of-ballots-found-floating-in-the-lake-in-erie-pennsylvania/,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01HGamR-EiRIee_26MNAtwM_l3jnA%3A1607147891843&ei=cyHLX-fuMora-gS6uZ34Ag&q=thousand+ballots+found+in+Lake+Erie+&oq=thousand+ballots+found+in+Lake+Erie+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgUIIRCgAToHCAAQRxCwAzoHCCMQrgIQJzoFCCEQqwI6BwghEAoQoAE6BQghEJIDOggIIRAWEB0QHlD8dFimngFgkaUBaAFwAHgAgAHCAogB1AuSAQgxMC4xLjAuMpgBAKABAaABAqoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwin9Ma5lLbtAhUKrZ4KHbpcBy8Q4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ballots%20floating%20erie%20pennsylvania&ia=web,https://search.justice.gov/search?affiliate=justice&page=2&query=thousand+ballots+lake+erie+pennsylvania&sort_by=&utf8=%E2%9C%93,https://www.fbi.gov/@@search?SearchableText=thousand+ballots+lake+erie+pennsylvania&searchHelpText=To+narrow+your+search%2C+select+a+content+type+option+listed+under+%E2%80%9CMore.%E2%80%9D+To+broaden+your+search+to+other+FBI+sites%2C+select+a+subdomain+listed+under+%E2%80%9CSource.%E2%80%9D&pageSize=20&page=1&sort_on=effective&sort_order=descending&after=2019-12-08,https://twitter.com/ErieCountyBOE/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/02/fact-check-video-technician-manipulating-voting-data-gwinnett-county-georgia/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/thousands-of-ballots-found-floating-in-the-lake-in-erie-pennsylvania/,https://americaslastlineofdefense.com/about-us/,https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81f5f3e4f7eef3c1e2e9e4e2eaf8eef4f3e7e0e2f5afe2eeec","No, 3,000 Ballots Were Not Found Floating In Lake Erie",,,,,,

Verdict: False While the right-hand photo is genuine, the one on the left has been photoshopped to include a face mask and a walking boot on the wrong leg.   Fact Check:  The Facebook post juxtaposes two photos of Biden, one showing Biden with a walking boot on his right foot and the other allegedly showing the president-elect wearing it on his left foot. It attempts to allege that Biden “forgets which ankle he…. ‘Twisted.’” While the right-hand photo does actually show Biden wearing a walking boot, the picture on the left has been digitally altered. In the original version of the left-hand photo, there is no walking boot or face mask visible.   The Delaware Humane Association posted the original on Facebook in November 2018. The walking boot and face mask have been superimposed into the photo of Biden and his shelter dog Major. (RELATED: No, This Video Does Not Show Joe Biden Wearing An Ankle Monitor) The right-hand image appears to come from Dec. 1 in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden was seen wearing a walking boot on his right foot, according to Fox News. He has been wearing a walking boot since suffering hairline fractures in his right foot while playing with his dog in late November, The New York Times reported.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Malia Obama has been arrested. The story originated on a satirical website.   Fact Check: The Nov. 25 Facebook post shows a screen grab of an article titled “Malia Obama Arrested Again, Complete Media Blackout.” “The Obama family is royalty as far as the liberal media is concerned,” reads the screen grabbed article. “Not only did they not mention Malia Obama’s arrest in 2016 for providing her little sister’s Girl Scout troop with ‘enough whip-its to drop a team of well-kept alpacas,’, but they failed to report Malia Obama’s bloogie arrest a month ago as well.”  The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any news reports about Malia Obama being arrested. While the screen grabbed article alleges news outlets didn’t cover the story because of a “complete media blackout,” that is not the case. It’s because the arrest described in the article never happened. A search of the headline revealed the story originated on the website Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network of “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The satirical article describes a fictional account of Malia Obama supposedly being “busted by campus security at Harvard as she and a friend were caught using a ‘white, powdery substance’ in the women’s shower room” and being subsequently brought to “Harvard County Jail.” Harvard University, where Malia Obama attends college, is located in Cambridge in Massachusetts’ Middlesex County. There is no “Harvard County” in Massachusetts. (RELATED: Was Barack Obama Arrested For Espionage?) Despite Daily World Update disclaiming “everything on this website is fiction,” numerous blogs shared the story as if it were real.

The statement was originally tweeted by Canadian member of Parliament Jack Harris.   Fact Check: In recent days, hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers have gathered in the streets of Delhi, the nation’s capital, blocking roads and points of entry in protest of the signing of a recent law to reform the farming industry, BBC News reported. Police have used tear gas and water cannons in attempts to disperse the protesters, according to Al Jazeera. (RELATED: No, Kamala Harris Did Not Tweet Asking Her Followers To Report A Specific Instagram Account) The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet from Harris, who will be the first Indian-American woman vice president, in support of the farmers. The alleged tweet reads: “We are shocked to see the Indian government’s suppression of farmers protesting new laws which will endanger their livelihood. Instead of using water cannons and tear gas, the Indian government needs to engage in open dialogue with farmers.”  There is, however, no evidence that Harris has commented on the matter. No media outlets have reported that the vice president-elect has made statements about the issue. The alleged tweet could also not be found on either of her verified Twitter accounts — @KamalaHarris and @SenKamalaHarris — nor is there any record of it in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. An internet search of the quote reveals it was actually tweeted by Canadian member of Parliament Jack Harris on Nov. 28. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also voiced support for the protesters and said his government has reached out to the Indian government to “highlight their concerns,” according to The Indian Express. This isn’t the first time social media users have shared a fake tweet from Harris. In late August, Check Your Fact debunked the false claim that Harris sent a tweet “setting the record straight” about her name.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Holtz authored the statement in the post. It originated from a column written by Bob Lonsberry in 2013.   Fact Check: The statement attributed to Holtz, who was the head football coach at the University of Notre Dame from 1986 to 1996 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008, has circulated on Facebook this month. President Donald Trump awarded Holtz the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Dec. 4, according to ESPN. “The Democrats are right, there are two Americas,” the post credits Holtz with saying. “The America that works and the America that doesn’t. The America that contributes and the America that doesn’t. It’s not the haves and the have nots, it’s the dos and the don’ts. Some people do their duty as Americans, obey the law, support themselves, contribute to society and others don’t. That’s the divide in America.”  The statement goes on to say that “it’s not about income inequality, it’s about civic irresponsibility” and talks about a political party that allegedly “preaches hatred, greed and victimization in order to win elective office” and “loves power more than it loves its country.” Iterations of the quote often feature the phrase “Lou Holtz Nails It!” There is, however, no evidence Holtz authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. Check Your Fact didn’t find any major media outlets attributing the quote to the former college football coach. It also doesn’t appear on his verified Twitter account. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, ‘America Is Now Great Do To My Sacrifices’?) The statement comes from a column written by Lonsberry. It was published on his website, where a line indicates it was written in December 2013. He published the “Two Americas” essay after then-President Barack Obama on Dec. 4, 2013 delivered remarks in which, according to the White House transcript, he discussed a “dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility” in America. Portions of the column have been erroneously attributed to Holtz over the years. Lonsberry confirmed to Snopes he wrote the column.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10221306659488093&set=a.10205324082493657,https://www.facebook.com/joanne.miller.547/posts/10223224335346133,https://und.com/coach/lou-holtz/,https://www.cfbhall.com/about/inductees/,https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30443996/lou-holtz-receives-presidential-medal-freedom-president-donald-trump,https://www.facebook.com/joanne.miller.547/posts/10223224335346133,https://www.facebook.com/joanne.miller.547/posts/10223224335346133,https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01D_dgdKTA8wIeMkjCKGp0C-2EA4Q%3A1607041989484&ei=xYPJX-2GHdX9-gTc0pzoAg&q=Lou+Holtz+%22The+Democrats+are+right%2C+there+are+two+Americas%22&oq=Lou+Holtz+%22The+Democrats+are+right%2C+there+are+two+Americas%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoFCAAQsAM6CQgAELADEAcQHjoJCAAQsAMQCBAeOgQIIxAnOgsILhCxAxCDARDJAzoICAAQsQMQgwE6DQgAELEDEIMBEBQQhwI6BAgAEEM6CAguELEDEIMBOgcIIxCxAhAnOgoILhCxAxCDARAKOgoIABCxAxCDARAKOgcIIxCwAhAnOgoILhCxAxCDARANOgoIABCxAxCDARANOgQIABANOgcIABDJAxBDUIq4KViiyitgl5csaANwAHgAgAGdAYgB4QiSAQQxMS4zmAEAoAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBA8ABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwit_a_3ibPtAhXVvp4KHVwpBy0Q4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://twitter.com/search?q=two%20Americas%20(from%3ACoachLouHoltz88)&src=typed_query,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/27/fact-check-donald-trump-tweet-american-great-sacrifices-memorial-day/,http://www.lonsberry.com/writings.cfm?story=3651,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/04/remarks-president-economic-mobility,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lou-holtz-didn39t-nail-it/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f1858394879e83b1929994929a889e848397909285df929e9c",Did Lou Holtz Make This Statement About ‘Two Americas’?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows Biden wearing a walking boot, not an ankle monitor, after suffering hairline fractures in his right foot.   Fact Check: The caption of the video, which has been shared over 2,900 times, attempts to suggest that Biden is wearing an ankle monitor on his right leg, saying, “There it is. #AnkleMonitor.” The C-SPAN footage appears to come from Wilmington, Delaware, on Dec. 1. (RELATED: No, Ellen DeGeneres Isn’t Under House Arrest For Child Sex Trafficking) C-SPAN tweeted the footage on Dec. 1 with the caption: “President-elect @JoeBiden’s walking boot.” Biden has to wear a walking boot because he recently suffered hairline fractures in his right foot while playing with his dog, according to The New York Times. In a statement, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, Biden’s personal doctor, said that the president-elect will likely have to use a walking boot for “several weeks.”  “Initial x-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging,” O’Connor said in the statement, according to CBS News. “Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden’s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.” Supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory spread the false claim that Biden is wearing an ankle monitor, Newsweek reported. Check Your Fact has previously debunked social media posts alleging that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pictured wearing an ankle monitor and that Tom Hanks had to wear one after being arrested for pedophilia in Australia.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Just heard Gina Haspel, CIA head is dead! If POTUS knew about fraud 2 1/2 yrs ago & there was a big sting OP going down, a LOT of DC, state capitals and pols are going down VERY HARD! Penalty for treason= death Suicide weekend? — Marc Lawson (@166Factor) November 30, 2020  Verdict: False   There is no evidence Haspel has died. A spokesperson for the CIA confirmed she is alive. Fact Check: Haspel was sworn in as the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency in late May 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported. She has held a number of positions in the CIA since joining the agency in 1985, including deputy director of the National Clandestine Service and deputy director of the National Clandestine Service for Foreign Intelligence and Covert Action, according to her White House biography.  The claim that she died started circulating widely on social media in late November. One Facebook post making the claim reads, “Gina Haspel, (for those that don’t know(CIA Director) Found Dead. Clearly a better exit strategy considering the inevitable. A corpse can’t talk.” There is, however, no evidence Haspel has died. Had the director of the CIA died, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The CIA has not mentioned her supposed passing on its website, nor has it put anything to that effect on its social media pages. “Well…this is the most absurd inquiry I’ve ever addressed, but I’m happy to tell you that Director Haspel is alive and well and at the office,” CIA spokesperson Nicole de Haay wrote in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: Was There A Communications Blackout In DC During George Floyd Protests On June 1?) Some posts falsely alleging Haspel died suggest her death occurred during an incident in which the U.S. Army raided a CIA facility in Frankfurt, Germany, to seize servers supposedly containing evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Spokespeople for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Special Forces Operations Command told the Military Times that such allegations were “false.” The bogus claim about the raid on the CIA facility in Germany stemmed from false allegations of the Army seizing servers from either the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems or Scytl in Germany. Both election technology companies and the U.S. Army refuted that claim, Check Your Fact reported.

Verdict: False Ramaphosa asked world leaders to ensure that the vaccine will be made available to all countries. He has not announced that it will be mandatory for South Africans.   Fact Check: The Facebook post features what appears to be a photo of a TV showing a news broadcast from eNews Channel Africa (ENCA), a South African news channel, in which Ramaphosa is speaking while a chyron below him reads, “Ramaphosa: All Must Get The Vaccine.” (RELATED: Did South African President Cyril Ramaphosa Order All Foreigners To Vacate The Country By June 21 Due To COVID-19?) “CYRIL-THE-SQUIRREL SAYS YOU DON’T …. LET ME REPEAT THAT, YOU DON’T HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL OR WON’T HAVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE,” reads the image’s caption. “HE HAS SAID THAT IT WILL BE MANDATORY AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE THE VACCINE!”  The chyron is from a Nov. 21 ENCA broadcast of Ramaphosa addressing world leaders during a G20 summit about the coronavirus pandemic and the accessibility of a vaccine once one becomes available. Ramaphosa did not, however, mandate everyone get a COVID-19 vaccine. Ramaphosa’s remarks at the summit were covered by numerous media outlets, none of which reported that he made such a comment. The chyron below Ramaphosa while he is speaking is seemingly referencing his plea for equal access to the vaccine, not an announcement of the vaccine being mandatory. At no point during the summit did he call for the vaccine to be mandatory, according to his statements made at the event. “Another immediate task is to ensure that there is equitable and affordable access for all countries to the COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed,” Ramaphosa stated during the summit. “I would like to call upon the G20 countries to assist with the funding shortfalls for the access to COVID-19 tools accelerator to ensure this platform is able to deliver on its mandate.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False Spokespeople for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Special Forces Operations Command have refuted allegations of the raid. The claim appears to be an iteration of a previously debunked rumor about the Army seizing servers in Germany from an election technology firm.   Fact Check: The post, which shows two screen grabbed tweets, alleges that one CIA agent and five soldiers died in the raid on a CIA facility in Frankfurt. The U.S. Special Forces conducting the purported raid seized servers that contain evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, the post further claims. (RELATED: Did The US Army Seize Servers From Dominion Voting Systems In Germany?) Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney spread the claim about the alleged U.S. military raid on the CIA facility in a Nov. 28 interview with the online show Worldview Weekend. However, spokespeople for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Special Forces Operations Command told the Military Times that the allegations of the raid are “false.”  The allegation appears to be an iteration of the false claim that the Army seized servers in Frankfurt from either the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems or Scytl. When that older iteration circulated on social media, both election technology firms refuted it. An Army spokesperson also told Check Your Fact via email at the time that it “did not conduct any sort of raid in Germany nor did we acquire any servers with election data.” The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint Nov. 12 statement from the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council that said there is “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” The statement also said the Nov. 3 election was the “most secure in American history.” President-elect Joe Biden became the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 7, according to The Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Obama has been arrested. The quotes in the Conservative Beaver article come from a press release about the arrest of a former CIA officer.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a Conservative Beaver article, titled, “Former President Barack Obama arrested for ESPIONAGE,” that was published Nov. 28. The Conservative Beaver is a self-described Canadian conservative news website that publishes “news from your favourite alternative sources.” “Barack Obama, a former President of the US, was arrested on Nov. 28, 2020, on a charge that he conspired with a business partner of his who also was a former CIA officer to communicate classified information up to the Top Secret level to intelligence officials of the People’s Republic of China (PRC),” reads the article, in part. It goes on to claim that a judge ordered a “media blackout” in the U.S. that Canadian and Spanish-language outlets are not subject to and, thus, have reported on the development.  There is, however, no evidence Obama has been arrested. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any U.S. or international news outlets reporting on the supposed arrest. The Department of Justice (DOJ) website likewise makes no mention of Obama being arrested for any crime. (RELATED: Did A DOJ Investigation Find That Barack Obama And George Soros Created Antifa?) The article quotes Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers and other DOJ and law enforcement officials as commenting on the former president’s alleged arrest. Searching for the quotes online revealed that they actually come from an Aug. 17 DOJ press release about the arrest of Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, a former CIA officer charged with espionage. The article appears to have been lifted nearly word-for-word from the press release, only changing the name and date. There is no mention of Obama in that press release. The Conservative Beaver has previously published misinformation. The DCNF recently debunked a false claim shared by the outlet that billionaire George Soros had been arrested for election-related crimes.

Screenshot/Facebook Verdict: False State and county officials in Georgia said the video shows a contractor using a USB drive to transfer a report from an Election Management Server to a county computer to read information. Dominion Voting Systems has said that it is “not physically possible” to manipulate votes through a USB drive. Fact Check:   In the video, a man moves from working on a desktop computer to a laptop, clicks different pages on the screen and removes what looks like a USB drive from the device before leaving the room. It’s unclear what is visible on the laptop’s screen because it is blurry and far away in the video. Some social media users shared the video along with claims that it shows an employee from the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems manipulating voting data in Gwinnett County. The caption to one such Facebook post reads, “Watch a Dominion Representative at Gwinnett County Election Central, responsible for tabulating ballots and certifying results, download data to a USB from the Election Management Server, plug it into a laptop, manipulate the data, then palm the USB.” State and county officials said that description is inaccurate. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting systems implementation manager, said in a Dec. 1 press conference that the man was “transferring a report on batches from an [Election Management Server] to a county computer so he could read it,” according to video of the event. He also said that the contractor has received death threats, GPB reported.   “This is a Dominion technician producing a data report on the server and saving the report to a Dominion USB thumb drive and then using a laptop to filter requested information,” Joe Sorensen, communications director for Gwinnett County, also told Check Your Fact in an email. “The Dominion servers are not equipped with Excel and counties are not authorized to install any hardware or software on these systems.” Kay Stimson, Dominion Voting Systems’ Vice President of Government Affairs, referred Check Your Fact to Sterling’s comments at the press conference. Michael Steel, a spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems, told Fox News in a Nov. 22 interview that it was “physically impossible” to switch votes on one of the firm’s machines and that it was “not physically possible” for a poll worker to use a USB to add votes for a candidate. “The tabulator has no unlocked thumb drive access, no unlocked USB ports,” Steel said. He then added that the “machines are what we call air-gapped, they are not connected to the internet.” (RELATED: Did Georgia’s DeKalb County Reject 40,000 Mail-In Ballots?) The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council issued a joint Nov. 12 statement that said there is “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” The statement also said the election was the “most secure in American history.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and top election officials certified the state’s results for the 2020 election on Nov. 20. President-elect Joe Biden won the state by over 12,600 votes, according to The Associated Press.

Verdict: False The WHO has not “completely taken a U-turn” on its guidance for isolation, quarantine and social distancing and continues to recommend such measures for COVID-19 mitigation. It also continues to state that COVID-19 transmits from person to person.   Fact Check: The WHO has provided public health guidance on how to protect against the spread of COVID-19 during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show WHO Lockdown Guidelines) In recent weeks, some Facebook users have alleged the WHO has “completely taken a U-turn” and now recommends that a “Corona patient neither needs to be isolated, nor quarantined.” Such posts also claim the WHO has said social distancing is not necessary because the virus supposedly cannot transmit from person to person.  That is, however, incorrect. The WHO still recommends isolation and quarantine as “methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19” on its website. Isolation means separating people that exhibit COVID-19 symptoms or that test positive for the virus from other individuals, while quarantine means separating people who have been exposed to COVID-19 through close contact with infected individuals from others, according to the WHO. In the “Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): How is it transmitted?” section of its website, the WHO describes COVID-19 as an infectious disease “caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people, mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.” The organization continues to advise, among other measures, maintaining “at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak.” Some social media users making the erroneous claim shared with it a video clip of the WHO’s Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove from early June. In the video clip, Kerkhove says, “From the data we have, it still seems rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onwards to a secondary individual.” Kerkhove clarified the following day that she was referencing a “subset of studies” and wasn’t “stating a policy of WHO,” saying, “I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that’s misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies.” “We do know that some people who are asymptomatic or some people who don’t have symptoms can transmit the virus on,” she also added.

Verdict: False There is no evidence the Broncos have signed Kaepernick. Neither the NFL team nor Kaepernick have announced such a thing at the time of publication.   Fact Check: The image shows a photo of Kaepernick and the logo for the Denver Broncos, along with text that reads, “BREAKING: Broncos Signing Colin Kaepernick.” Facebook and Instagram users shared the meme widely on Nov. 28, a day before the Broncos played the New Orleans Saints, and have continued to shared it since then. Broncos quarterbacks Drew Lock, Brett Rypien and Jeff Driskel, as well as practice squad quarterback Blake Bortles, were ineligible to play Sunday against the Saints after being placed on the COVID-19/restricted list, according to The Associated Press. Lock, Rypien and Bortles were disqualified due not wearing masks around each other before Driskel tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, ESPN reported.  The seeming lack of available quarterbacks sparked inaccurate rumors that the Broncos had signed Kaepernick. No national media outlets have reported about the Broncos signing the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback. The Broncos have also not put out a press release announcing such a thing, nor has Kaepernick posted about it on his Twitter account. The NFL’s COVID-19 protocols would also have prevented Kaepernick from playing in the game against the Saints  if the Broncos had signed him for that reason, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Newly acquired players must self-isolate for six days before joining their new team, according to NBC Sports. (RELATED: Did Tim Tebow Kneel During The National Anthem To Protest Against Abortion?)

Verdict: False The Michigan Department of State website on Nov. 1 showed over 8 million registered voters. The number of ballots cast in Michigan’s presidential election – over 5.5 million – did not exceed the state’s number of registered voters on Nov. 1 or on the day following Election Day.   Fact Check: Social media posts making claims about swing states having more ballots cast than registered voters have circulated widely since Election Day. This particular Facebook post, which shows a screen grab of a Nov. 19 tweet, alleges, “8.1 Million ‘people’ voted in Michigan. Here’s the problem…there are only 7.8 Million registered voters. This isn’t hard.” Michigan had record voter turnout for the 2020 presidential election, according to The Associated Press. Data from the Michigan Secretary of State’s office shows that there were over 5.5 million ballots cast in Michigan for the presidential election. The number of ballots cast did not, however, exceed the state’s number of registered voters.  An archived version of the Michigan Department of State’s Voter Information Center website from Nov. 1 shows that there were over 8 million registered voters in the state. Statistics displayed on the same webpage on Nov. 4, the day after Election Day, showed that there were over 8.1 million registered voters in Michigan. The state allows same-day voter registration. “5.5 million citizens voted in Michigan’s election and the state has 8.1 million voters registered,” Jake Rollow, director of communications and external affairs for the Michigan Secretary of State’s office, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email. Approximately 71 percent of Michigan residents age 18 and older voted in the election, The Associated Press reported. (No, A Michigan Man Who Died In 1984 Did Not Vote In The 2020 Election) The Michigan State Board of Canvassers voted to certify President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the state’s 16 electoral votes on Nov. 23, CNN reported. Media outlets such as The Associated Press, Fox News and ABC News had previously projected Biden as the winner of the presidential race in Michigan on Nov. 4.

Multiple major media outlets hosted streams that each garnered over tens of thousands of views as Nov. 26   Fact Check: The image, which shows a pro-Trump Twitter account, has circulated in the days since Biden delivered an address on Nov. 25, the day before Thanksgiving. The screen grabbed tweet reads, “Sleepy Joe Biden had a whopping 1,000 viewers for his special LIVE Thanksgiving message, where were the other 79,999,000 people?” A review of various online streams of Biden’s address by Check Your Fact found that it received more than 1,000 viewers online. (RELATED: Were 6,000 Fraudulent Votes Found For Joe Biden In Arizona?)  Biden’s address was streamed live on various platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. An archived version of the Biden campaign’s YouTube stream from Nov. 25 shows the video having over 36,000 views. The same video has over 109,000 views at the time of publication. News outlets such as USA Today, CNBC, CBS News and PBS NewsHour also streamed the speech on their respective YouTube channels. For example, CNBC’s stream showed over 29,000 views the morning of Nov. 26, according to an archived version of the YouTube video. Streams from CBS News and PBS NewsHour garnered some 72,300 and 21,700 views, respectively, by Nov. 26, archived pages on the Wayback Machine show. Biden aired the address on his Facebook and Twitter accounts. At the time of publication, the version on Biden’s Facebook page has over 583,000 views, while the version on his transition team’s Twitter account has over 79,500 viewers. The inaccurate claim likely originated from a tweet showing what appears to be a screen grab of 1,000 people tuning into Biden’s Thanksgiving address live on Twitter at one point. One America News Network and President Donald Trump amplified the claim that his address only drew 1,000 viewers. That tweet, however, failed to take into account all the various news sites that simultaneously streamed Biden’s speech.

Verdict: False The video actually shows a 2019 campaign event for former Argentine President Mauricio Macri, not a funeral procession for Maradona.   Fact Check: Maradona, a legendary Argentinian soccer player, died from heart failure on Nov. 25 at the age of 60, CNN reported. Crowds of fans gathered in Buenos Aires after Argentine President Alberto Fernández declared three days of mourning for the “national hero,” according to BBC News. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Confuse Diego Maradona With Madonna In A Tweet?) One video shared on Facebook shows thousands of people flooding the streets near what appears to be the Obelisk landmark in Buenos Aires waving flags as they allegedly gather to watch Maradona’s funeral procession. “The Ocean of People at the Legendary Football Player Diego Maradona’s funeral procession scenes at Buenos Aires,” the video’s caption reads.  The video, however, is not from the funeral. The Daily Caller News Foundation found several videos reporting on an Oct. 19, 2019 rally for the re-election of then-President Mauricio Macri that seemingly match the scene shown in the video on Facebook. Multiple details are consistent throughout the videos shared in 2019 from the rally and the video shared in the Facebook post, indicating they’re from the same event. For instance, each video shows large, white balloons floating above the crowd and the stage appears to be in the same location with several videos showing the Obelisk landmark behind it. Large crowds did, in fact, gather in Buenos Aires on Nov. 26 to watch Maradona’s funeral procession, according to photos and videos from the procession. Tens of thousands of fans lined up to pay their respects to Maradona while he lay in state in Buenos Aires’ presidential palace, and thousands crowded the streets along the route the hearse took to the cemetery, The New York Times reported.   Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Data provided by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s office to the U.S. Elections Project shows that the number of mail ballots returned – over 2.6 million – has not exceeded the number requested in the state. Fact Check:   The image, which shows a screen grabbed tweet, alleges that Pennsylvania mailed out 1.8 million absentee ballots for the 2020 general election but ultimately counted 2.5 million of them. The Twitter user remarks, “I’m no genius, but I’m pretty sure **700,000** phantom votes is evidence of widespread FRAUD.” In an Oct. 27 press release, the Pennsylvania governor’s office said over 3 million people applied to vote by mail for the general election. The U.S. Elections Project reports that a total of over 2.6 million mail ballots in Pennsylvania were returned – fewer than the number of mail ballots requested in the state. Over 1.9 million Democrats and nearly 785,000 Republicans requested mail ballots in Pennsylvania, as well as some 25,000 people with minor party registration and over 336,000 people with no party affiliation, according to data provided to the U.S. Elections Project by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s office. The return rate for mail ballots was 87.7 percent among Democrats and 79.4 percent among Republicans, the U.S. Election Project reported.  The number of mail-in ballots the post inaccurately claims were sent out during the general election appears to either come from the number of mail ballots requested in the general election by people registered as Democrats or the number of mail ballots requested overall during the state’s primary election in June. (RELATED: Did RealClearPolitics Rescind Biden’s Win In Pennsylvania, Therefore Stripping Him Of His President-Elect Status?) Over 1.8 million mail-in ballots were requested for the primary election, according to data from Open Data Pennsylvania. During the primary election, over 1.4 million votes were cast via mail or absentee ballot, according to a report from the Pennsylvania Department of State. The “Pennsylvania election hearings” that the Instagram post mentions appears to be a reference to a Republican-led state Senate committee hearing held in Gettysburg on Nov. 25. Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, made a similar claim at the hearing, a transcript shows, and so did Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano on Twitter. Pennsylvania certified its election results for president and vice president on Nov. 24, The Associated Press reported. President-elect Joe Biden received over 3.4 million votes in Pennsylvania, while President Donald Trump received over 3.3 million votes and Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen received over 79,000, according to a Nov. 24 press release from the Pennsylvania government.

Verdict: False The photo shows Biden speaking to a Detroit store owner’s son, not Floyd’s daughter.   Fact Check: The claim that the photo shows Biden kneeling while apologizing to Floyd’s daughter has circulated widely on Facebook in recent days. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25 during an incident where, according to video, a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. His death sparked protests against police brutality and racial injustice across the U.S. and abroad, CNN reported. While Floyd did, according to USA Today, have children, the child pictured in the photo is not one of them. Check Your Fact discovered through a reverse image search that the photo instead shows Biden on Sept. 9 interacting with the son of a Michigan man who owns a clothing store in Detroit.  Biden posted the photo on his Instagram in September, writing, in part, that he believes “in a better future for our children and will fight for them until the very end.” (RELATED: Image Claims George Floyd’s Death Was Filmed Before The Coronavirus Pandemic)               View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Joe Biden (@joebiden)    Other photos of Biden’s interaction with the boy taken from different angles can be found on Getty Images and Reuters Connect. The caption for one picture, taken by Reuters photographer Leah Millis, states that it shows Biden stopping to speak to the child as the then-presidential candidate “makes a brief stop at ‘Three Thirteen’ clothing store to buy a few items for his grandchildren.” Another photo shows Biden speaking to the father, identified in the caption as a store owner, while the son stands nearby. The former vice president in early June met with members of Floyd’s family in Houston, Texas, before the man’s burial, according to USA Today.

Report: 6K fake Biden votes found in Arizona “lead“ drops to 4K — LORI HENDRY (@Lrihendry) November 25, 2020  Verdict: False The temporary drop in Biden’s lead in Arizona was the result of an uploading error in Greenlee County that was quickly caught and corrected, according to a spokesperson for the Arizona Secretary of State.   Fact Check: The tweet attempts to suggest that 6,000 fraudulent votes discovered in Arizona caused Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump to drop from over 10,000 votes to some 4,000 votes. Screen grabs of the tweet have also been shared on Facebook by users making similar claims. In reality, the temporary drop in Biden’s lead was the result of an uploading error in Arizona’s Greenlee County that has since been corrected. Unofficial election results were “displaying incorrectly briefly on Tuesday due to an error that posted Greenlee County’s results multiple times while the county was uploading write-in candidate info,” Sophia Solis, a public information office for the Arizona Secretary of State, explained to Check Your Fact in an email.  The error temporarily showed the county as reporting over 22,100 votes rather than about 3,700, NBC affiliate 12 News reported. ABC 15 data analyst Garrett Archer noted the uploading error in a Nov. 24 tweet that, according to CNN, some Twitter users later cited to falsely allege fraud in Arizona. Archer said in a tweet that such an uploading error “happens from time to time,” noting, “No, the results didn’t change, no the canvass is not wrong.” In another subsequent tweet, he noted that “the UNOFFICIAL results page has been corrected.” (RELATED: Did Arizona State Trooper Find 50,000 Ballots Cast For Donald Trump In A Dumpster?) The unofficial results on the Arizona Secretary of State website show Biden leading Trump by some 10,400 votes at the time of publication. The deadline for Arizona to certify its election results is Nov. 30, according to The New York Times.

A New Zealand government spokesperson confirmed there is no such law in place.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a headline of an Oct. 27 article written by Investment Watch Blog that reads, “New Food Bill in New Zealand Takes Away Human Right to Grow Food.” The article, first posted in 2011, states the new bill “will make it a privilege and not a right to grow food,” and “pave the way to reduce the plant diversity and small owner operations in New Zealand.” The Daily Caller News Foundation, however, found no evidence that New Zealand has passed any law making it illegal to grow food. A spokesperson for New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries, the government department responsible for overseeing fishing, food and biosecurity on the island, confirmed that no such law exists.  “The claims made in the screenshot are entirely false and there is no legislation supporting these claims,” the spokesperson said via email to the DCNF. (RELATED: Ben Shapiro Says New Zealand Has ‘Well Over 200,000 Licensed Gun Owners’) The spokesperson pointed the DCNF to information on the Ministry’s website about the legislation in place regarding food safety and seeds. In both instances, the DCNF found no evidence suggesting growing food in New Zealand is illegal, only that seeds “need to meet biosecurity requirements to prevent the entry of unwanted organisms into New Zealand.” The blog post appears to be referencing the Food Act of 2014, a bill first introduced in 2010 which implemented a series of regulations aimed at establishing food safety rules for businesses selling food. In August 2011, a petition opposing the bill was created and garnered thousands of signatures from those who believed the bill may impede the growing and sharing of food on the local level, according to the Sunday Star Times. The final version of the bill, passed into law in 2014, focused instead on businesses that sell food, not on community gardens and farms growing food for self-consumption or sharing, a spokesperson for New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries told BuzzFeed in 2016. A full list of those exempt from the regulations imposed by the bill can be found on the Ministry for Primary Industries’ website. The claim featured in the post has circulated since at least 2011 and has been previously debunked by Buzzfeed, Huffington Post and the Australian Associated Press.

Verdict: False Elections Canada, the independent federal agency that runs the country’s federal elections, states that it uses hand-counted paper ballots for federal elections. The agency also said it does not use Dominion Voting Systems.   Fact Check: Election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of baseless allegations of voter fraud in regards to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the Washington Post reported. (RELATED: Is The Chairman Of Dominion Voting Systems Part Of Joe Biden’s Transition Team?) The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council stated that there was “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Dominion Voting Systems likewise addressed the claims on its website, saying that “vote deletion/switching assertions are completely false” and that “there were no Dominion software glitches.”  The image being shared on Facebook appears to reference those allegations. Text below a photo of Trudeau and President Donald Trump shaking hands says, “The ‘glitchy’ Dominion ballot counting machines used in swing states to elect Joe Biden were also used to re-elect Justin Trudeau – coincidence?” Originally elected prime minister in 2015, Trudeau was re-elected in October 2019, NPR reported. Contrary to the post’s claim, Dominion Voting Systems ballot-counting machines weren’t used in either the 2015 or 2019 federal election in Canada. Elections Canada, the independent agency that conducts the country’s federal elections, addressed such claims in a Nov. 16 tweet, saying ballots in Canadian federal elections are hand-counted.  Elections Canada does not use Dominion Voting Systems. We use paper ballots counted by hand in front of scrutineers and have never used voting machines or electronic tabulators to count votes in our 100-year history. #CdnPoli pic.twitter.com/dp7ZiB84ql — Elections Canada (@ElectionsCan_E) November 16, 2020  “Elections Canada does not use Dominion Voting Systems,” the agency stated. “We use paper ballots counted by hand in front of scrutineers and have never used voting machines or electronic tabulators to count votes in our 100-year history.” While federal elections in Canada do not use Dominion Voting Systems, local and provincial elections have used its voting machines, according to Elections Canada. When Trudeau was first elected leader of Canada’s Liberal Party in 2013, Dominion Voting Systems ran the electronic voting system for that party leadership election, The Globe and Mail reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=3447911838622564&set=a.1549724925107941,https://www.dominionvoting.com/about/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/dominion-voting-trump-faq/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/25/fact-check-peter-neffenger-chairman-dominion-voting-systems-biden-transition-team/,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election,https://www.dominionvoting.com/,https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=3447911838622564&set=a.1549724925107941,https://www.npr.org/2019/10/22/772157906/in-canadian-vote-trudeaus-liberals-on-top-but-lose-absolute-majority,https://www.elections.ca/home.aspx,https://twitter.com/ElectionsCan_E/status/1328449565096366083,https://twitter.com/hashtag/CdnPoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/dp7ZiB84ql,https://twitter.com/ElectionsCan_E/status/1328449565096366083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rec/tech/ivote/comp&document=municip&lang=e,https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rec/tech/ivote/comp&document=municip&lang=e,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-wins-liberal-party-leadership-in-landslide-1.1237256,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-await-results-from-new-leadership-voting-system/article11183723/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4733352231283507242f22242c3e283235212624336924282a",Were Dominion Voting Systems Ballot-Counting Machines Used To Re-Elect Justin Trudeau In 2019?,,,,,,

A great person. Her music was wonderful.” Verdict: False There is no record of Trump tweeting or deleting this message. Fact Check:   Diego Maradona, a legendary Argentinian soccer player, died from heart failure Wednesday at the age of 60, CNN reported. News of his death prompted an outpouring of mourning and tributes from fans across the globe, and Argentinian President Alberto Fernández declared three days of national morning, according to BBC News. A post on Facebook shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet sent from Trump attempting to offer his condolences to the soccer player. Trump seemingly confuses Maradona with the American singer Madonna, who is alive, in the tweet. “Very sad to hear about the death of Maradona,” Trump’s alleged tweet reads. “A great person. Her music was wonderful. I remember listening to her albums in the early 1980’s. Rest In Peace!” (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet That He Would ‘Leave The Country’ If Joe Biden Wins?)  The tweet, however, appears to be fabricated. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Trump’s verified Twitter accounts —@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — but found no remarks resembling the tweet attributed to him. A search of ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets likewise failed to uncover any matches. While Trump does not appear to have confused the two celebrities, some social media users appear to have made the mistake. Madonna’s name was trending on Twitter after numerous Twitter users mistook Maradona’s name for hers, posting tributes and their condolences to the singer, according to media reports.

Verdict: False The video shows a shredding company helping dispose of “non-relevant” election-related materials. No ballots or other materials “relevant to the election or the re-tally” were disposed of, according to a statement from the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration.   Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users posted the video along with claims that it shows officials in Cobb County destroying ballots. In the video, a person moves garbage cans to and from a truck that seems to be from A-1 Shredding and Recycling. The video appears to have been taken at the Jim R. Miller Park Event Center in Marietta, a city northwest of Atlanta and the Cobb County seat. “From Attorney Lin Wood’s Twitter account, turn up the volume and listen,” reads the caption of one Facebook post. “Ballots being destroyed THIS MORNING in Cobb County, GA.” (RELATED: Video Falsely Claims To Show ‘Ballot Stuffing’ In Michigan)  Attorney L. Lin Wood Jr. tweeted the video on Nov. 20, the same day that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and top election officials certified the state’s results for the 2020 election. President-elect Joe Biden won the state by over 12,600 votes, according to the official results on the Georgia Secretary of State’s website. The video, however, does not show Cobb County ballots being destroyed. The Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration explained in a Nov. 24 statement that the “shredding company routinely responds to the Elections Department following an election to help dispose of non-relevant materials that cannot be easily disposed of.” In the statement, the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration provided a list of items the shredding company helped dispose of that does not include ballots. The “non-relevant materials” disposed of includes incorrect mailing labels with voter information, copies of outdated procedures, addressed envelopes, printed emails, duplicates of faxed applications and sticky notes, among other things, according to the statement. “None of these items are relevant to the election or the re-tally,” Elections Director Janine Eveler said in the statement. “Everything of consequence, including the ballots, absentee ballot applications with signatures, and anything else used in the count or re-tally remains on file. After an out-of-context video was shared on social media we contacted state officials to reassure them this was a routine clean-up operation and they could come to inspect our stored materials if they wished.” President Donald Trump’s campaign formally requested an additional machine recount of the presidential race in Georgia on Nov. 21. Georgia election officials said the recount, which counties must complete by 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 2, is unlikely to change the overall outcome of the election, The Associated Press reported.

Dingoes are wild dogs found in Australia, a country that, according to the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, is also home to about 140 species of land snakes and 32 recorded species of sea snakes. Facebook users have recently been sharing the photo as if it genuinely shows the two snakes mating while a nearby dingo eats a shark. One such post reads, “This is an actual photo of a wild dingo eating a shark while two snakes make love on the beach. Only in Australia.” (RELATED: Did Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison Tweet, ‘I’m So Glad We Don’t Have Any Racism Here In Australia’?)  In reality, the image being shared contains two separate photos that have been digitally combined. The photo of the dingo and shark has been available online since at least October 2011, when it appeared on the website The Meta Picture. Someone posted the photo of the intertwined snakes on the website Imgur in February 2012 and titled it: “Took a rare photo of 2 Copperhead Snakes in Australia.” This isn’t the first time social media users have shared the doctored photo, according to Buzzfeed News. It previously went viral in 2018, with British comedian Ricky Gervais tweeting the altered photo in April of that year.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/StrangePlanet1/posts/442718967143120,https://www.facebook.com/StrangePlanet1/posts/442718967143120,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/d/dingo/,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/native-animals/native-animal-facts/snakes#:~:text=Australia%20has%20around%20140%20species,wound%20that%20could%20kill%20you.,https://www.facebook.com/StrangePlanet1/posts/442718967143120,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/16/fact-check-scott-morrison-tweet-racism-australia-george-floyd/,https://web.archive.org/web/20190612085857/http://themetapicture.com/a-wild-dingo-eating-a-shark-welcome-to-australia/,https://imgur.com/gallery/xdXnH,https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/dingo-snake-shark,https://twitter.com/rickygervais/status/990147539902005249,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88fcfaedfee7fac8ebe0edebe3f1e7fdfaeee9ebfca6ebe7e5",Is This A Real Photo Of A Dingo Eating A Shark Near Two Snakes On An Australian Beach?,,,,,,

Tom Wolf’s administration that lists rules for celebrating Thanksgiving during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Verdict: False There is no evidence the Wolf administration put out the pictured document. A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health confirmed it was “certainly not created or authorized by the Wolf Administration.”   Fact Check:  The image purportedly shows a document containing “Pennsylvania Governor Wolf’s Rules for Thanksgiving Household Visits.” The list, which says the rules were “finalized” on Oct. 27, contains 13 alleged rules that Pennsylvania residents are expected to follow in order to celebrate Thanksgiving safely under COVID-19 guidelines. Some of the rules listed in the image include: banning turkey and mashed potatoes, limiting gatherings to under two hours, requiring the gatherings be held outside and warning against physical exertion. No more than three households, including one’s own, should be present so “if you have 3 married kids, only two of them are allowed to come,” the image claims. (RELATED: Do Pennsylvania Quarantine Letters Tell People They Can’t Vote On Election Day?)  There is, however, no evidence Wolf or his administration put out the pictured document. It appears on neither the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s website nor the governor’s website. The Pennsylvania government also hasn’t put out a news release promoting the document. Maggi Mumma, a spokesperson for the DOH, told Check Your Fact in an email that “this post is not real, and was certainly not created or authorized by the Wolf Administration.” The document appears to originate from a similar Facebook post that attempted to summarize California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s coronavirus guidelines released in October. While the list does include some actual restrictions put in place by Newsom, the creator of the list added his or her own language such as “No turkey or bowls of mash potatoes or cranberry salad.” The state of California has since updated its guidelines. Pennsylvania recently implemented more measures to help curb the spread of COVID-19. It strengthened its mask mandate to include requiring them indoors when people from different households are together and mandated people who travel to Pennsylvania from other states to test negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours prior to arrival, according to The Associated Press. The state also ordered “the retail food services industry, including bars, restaurants, and private catered events must end alcohol sales for on-site consumption at 5 p.m. on Nov. 25, 2020 only,” according to the governor’s website. “The holidays are a time for togetherness, but this year, we must rethink what that looks like,” Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levin said in a statement. “This Thanksgiving, choose to celebrate with the people in your household and virtually connect with your loved ones. If you plan to leave your home to celebrate the holiday, please follow the travel mitigation order, wear a mask and stay six feet apart from others. Weather-permitting, sit outside and enjoy the day.” The Pennsylvania Department of Health also urged residents to “limit holiday celebrations to members of their immediate household or limiting the number of people present at celebrations and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for a safer holiday.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for hosting holiday gatherings are available online.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Foxworthy’s publicist confirmed it is not from the comedian.   Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have in recent weeks shared an image of Foxworthy overlaid with a quote he allegedly said about Democratic governors, small businesses and the president. Foxworthy is an award-winning comedian known for delivering his signature “You Might Be A Redneck” one-liners during stand up routines. While the supposed quote does resemble his famous one-liners to some extent, there is no evidence Foxworthy made the statement. A search of his Twitter and Facebook pages, as well as his website, turned up no matches. The Daily Caller News Foundation also didn’t find any media outlets attributing the remark to Foxworthy.  The quote previously circulated on Twitter in August without being credited to the comedian, further adding to the attribution’s dubiousness. Maggie Houlehan, Foxworthy’s publicist, said in an email to the DCNF, “This is definitely NOT a quote from Jeff Foxworthy.” (RELATED: ‘The Fence Test’ — Did Jeff Foxworthy Write This Post Distinguishing Republicans From Democrats?) In a March interview with the New York Daily News, Foxworthy said he largely attempts to stay away from politics in his comedy, explaining, “No matter which side you’re on, half of the crowd is going to hate you. That’s not my job.” He also commented on quotes falsely attributed to him on social media: “It will have my name and my face, and go: here’s what Jeff said about this. And I go, no, Jeff did not say that.” This isn’t the first time Foxworthy has been the subject of a misattributed quote related to politics. In October 2019, Check Your Fact debunked the claim that he created a series of statements distinguishing Republicans from Democrats.

Fact Check: The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet from Trump’s verified Twitter account that says, “If Biden somehow manages to win this election, you won’t see me again, I’ll simply leave the country!” “He won, so what’s taking you so long to leave?” the image’s caption reads. “Get lost and never come back Trump!” (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, ‘Republican Governors Should Not Be Shutting Down Their States’?)  The tweet, however, is fabricated. It does not appear on Trump’s verified Twitter accounts — @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — nor does it appear on ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. The screen grab of the alleged tweet does not show when the tweet was sent or the number of likes, retweets and comments garnered, further calling into question its authenticity. While there is no evidence that Trump tweeted the message, he appeared to joke about leaving the country if Biden were to win the election during an October campaign rally in Georgia, Business Insider reported. “Running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me,” Trump told the crowd. “Could you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I going to do? I’m going to say ‘I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics.’ I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country? I don’t know.” Biden was announced the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 7. The General Services Administration recently told Biden’s team that it is ready to formally begin the transition process, according to CBS News.

Page administrators choose such designations.   Fact Check: The Nov. 22 post portrays the claim that Facebook removed the title “President-elect” from Biden’s page and replaced it with “Politician” as breaking news. It also includes a cropped version of a Getty Images photo showing Biden speaking at an August 2019 town hall in South Carolina. Archived versions of Biden’s Facebook page on the Wayback Machine show that his title has been “Politician” for some time. The “Politician” designation appeared on Biden’s page Nov. 7, the day he became the projected winner of the presidential election. The same title can be seen on days such as Nov. 8, 14, 17, 21 and 22, as well as on Aug. 11.  Check Your Fact also didn’t find any national or local media outlets reporting that Facebook had changed Biden’s title on the platform. Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook, previously indicated in an email to Check Your Fact that such designations are chosen by the Page administrator.

Verdict: False The image of the costumed man being arrested is actually from a 2014 climate protest in New York City. The claim appears to have originated on a satire website.   Fact Check: Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving known as the start of the holiday shopping season, typically draws crowds of shoppers camped outside waiting for stores to open. More shoppers are likely to choose to shop online this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported. The Facebook image shares two photos: one which shows what appears to be tents set up outside of a building along with a “breaking news” chyron reading, “Man in bear costume arrested for tearing apart tents of Black Friday shoppers,” and one showing a person dressed in a polar bear costume being taken away in handcuffs by police.  However, there is no evidence that a man wearing a polar bear costume was arrested for antagonizing Black Friday shoppers. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image of the costumed man being arrested was actually taken at a September 2014 climate protest in New York City, according to The Washington Post. The costumed protester was one of 100 protesters arrested during the protest, according to NBC New York. The arrests came a day after 300,000 people marched in New York City in the “People’s Climate March” to draw attention to climate change and its effects on the planet. (RELATED: Is Minecraft Shutting Down In December?) The claim may have originated from a 2017 article titled, “Man In Bear Costume Arrested For Tearing Apart Tents Of Black Friday Campers” published on 8 Satire, which describes itself as a “satire news and humor website.” The chyron seen in the Facebook image was likely created on a website that generates prank news chyrons and then added to the picture of tents along with the picture of the man in the polar bear costume being arrested.    share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

So the chairman of Dominion (Peter Neffenger) joined the Biden transition team last week You’d think this was a movie and not real life — Roz ???????? (@PolitiKurd) November 16, 2020   Verdict: False   Peter Neffenger is the chairman of the board of directors for Smartmatic, not Dominion Voting Systems. Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems state that they do not have ownership ties to each other. Fact Check: Since Election Day on Nov. 3, Dominion Voting Systems has been a popular target for misinformation related to the presidential election. Some social media posts attempt to link Dominion Voting Systems to Biden’s transition team by claiming Neffenger, the former TSA administrator, is the election technology firm’s chairman. (RELATED: Did The US Army Seize Servers From Dominion Voting Systems In Germany?)  While Neffenger is affiliated with Biden’s transition team, he serves as the chairman of the board of directors for the voting technology firm Smartmatic, not Dominion Voting Systems. The Biden-Harris transition website lists Neffenger as a “volunteer” for the Department of Homeland Security agency review team. Volunteers on Biden’s agency review teams are “individuals who are volunteering for the Transition in their personal capacity,” according to the Biden-Harris transition website. Dominion Voting Systems states on its website that the company “is not, and has never been, owned by Smartmatic,” noting that Dominion Voting Systems is “an entirely separate company and a fierce competitor to Smartmatic” that “does not use Smartmatic software.” Smartmatic does not “own any other voting machine company” and its software “is not licensed or otherwise used” in other companies’ voting machines, according to Smartmatic’s website. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council said in a joint Nov. 12 statement that “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” The statement came amid baseless claims that Dominion Voting Systems deleted or switched votes, an allegation the company “categorically denies” on its website. Check Your Fact has previously debunked social media posts making claims about Dominion Voting Systems that range from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi owning stock in the company to the U.S. Army seizing company servers in Germany.

Fact Check:   The alleged magazine cover features a picture of Obama grimacing, with text that reads, “My TIME is up.” In the bottom left side of the image is the word “TREASON,” followed by text that reads, “How former president Barack Obama was the kingpin of the biggest political scandal in modern history.” The entire image is surrounded by Time Magazine’s signature red border. “As Social Media is distracted by the Media and folks are scared of Covid-19 and white cop’s there is a developing real story that’s actually going on!” the image’s caption reads. “A story called Declassification. Fake News Media aren’t wanting too cover it but it’s Real News!” The cover, however, is not genuine. The image lacks some of the traditional markings of a Time Magazine cover, calling into question its authenticity. For instance, Time Magazine covers typically include the publication date in the top right corner and “time.com” in the bottom right-hand corner, both of which are absent from the image.  While Obama has been featured on the cover of Time Magazine numerous times, none of those covers have suggested he is guilty of treason. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched all the Time Magazine covers published since 2008, when Obama was first elected, but found nothing resembling the image shared on Facebook. “I can confirm that this is not an authentic TIME cover image,” Kristin Matzen, communications director for Time Magazine, told the DCNF in an email.

Verdict: False Dominion Voting Systems’ logo does not feature a blue ballot, nor is its slogan “changing the way people vote,” according to a spokesperson from the company.   Fact Check: In the weeks since the election, the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of baseless allegations of voter fraud, according to the Washington Post. President Donald Trump has elevated inaccurate claims about the company on Twitter, including the allegation that the firm “switched” votes from him to President-elect Joe Biden. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council has stated that there is “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Dominion Voting Systems also “categorically denies” the claims about vote switching on its website.  The image being shared appears to reference such allegations, claiming Dominion Voting Systems logo shows a red ballot entering a box and coming out blue, while text inside the image also suggests that the company’s slogan is “Changing the way people vote.” The caption reads, “This is Dominions’ logo and slogan, the company that manufactures voting machines. Their logo literally displays red ballot going in, blue ballot coming out. Coincidence? Hiding in plain sight more like it.” The image, however, does not show the company’s actual logo or slogan. Archived versions of the Dominion Voting Systems website over the years dating back to 2006 show neither the pictured logo nor slogan has been utilized on the website. Check Your Fact didn’t find any record of the company using the “Changing the way people vote” slogan in an internet search, and it doesn’t appear anywhere on the Dominion Voting Systems website. Dominion Voting Systems’ logo, which is visible on the website, is only comprised of the graphic of a red ballot going into a red ballot box alongside the words “Dominion Voting.” The blue ballot graphic in the post’s image appears to have been superimposed onto the original logo. (RELATED: Was A Philadelphia Mob Boss Hired To Produce 300,000 Ballots For Joe Biden?) Dominion Voting Systems Vice President of Government Affairs Kay Stimson refuted such claims in an email to Check Your Fact, saying, “This is a doctored image of the company logo.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of the Trump campaign sending such an email. A Trump campaign official confirmed it was fabricated. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a Nov. 22 email sent out by the Trump campaign. The alleged email bears the “Trump-Pence 2020” logo at the top and contains a message that reads, “All donations of $50 or more will include two tickets to President Trump’s inauguration in the historic Rose Garden.” However, the email appears to be a hoax. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find anything resembling the pictured email in an archive of political emails from the Trump campaign. The presidential inauguration ceremony typically occurs in front of the U.S. Capitol Building, not in the White House Rose Garden, further adding to the email’s dubiousness. Such a fundraising email would likely garner media coverage, yet no news reporting confirming the authenticity of the supposed email could be found. A Trump campaign official confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the email is fake. (RELATED: Did The Trump Campaign Email Supporters Asking For Donations To ‘Help Him Recover’ From COVID-19?)

Verdict: False The video dates back to at least 2018. The Eastern Railway said the video is old and not related to the recent resumption of local train services.   Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared the video claiming it shows a large crowd, seemingly violating social distancing guidelines, as it gathered at the Dumdum Junction railway station in Kolkata on Nov. 19 for the resumption of local train services. The local train services under the Eastern Railway’s jurisdiction halted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in November, according to The Economic Times. “On the Reopening Day of Local Train Service Yesterday (19/11/20) at Dum Dum Raiway (sic) Station After 8 Months of Lockdown and Shutdown of Train Service,” reads the caption of one such video. “What About the Spreading Mode of Covid-19 to Them is Not Known!”  The verified Eastern Railway Twitter account debunked the claim that the video shows the recent return of train services in a Nov. 13 tweet.

Ravi Mahapatra, a public relations officer for Eastern Railway, confirmed to AFP in 2018 that the video shows the Ranaghat station.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/100048284284069/videos/205325667753575/,https://www.facebook.com/100048284284069/videos/205325667753575/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/DUMDUM+JN+RAILWAY+STATION/@22.6215829,88.3923192,516m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x39f89dfa8bf620cf:0xb4bbe18f98c15040!2sDumDum!8m2!3d22.6214614!4d88.3928043!3m4!1s0x39f89dfa8b19c5d3:0xb94768b5f9d6aeb!8m2!3d22.6210567!4d88.392933,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-local-train-services-resume-in-west-bengal-after-over-7-months/article33071910.ece,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/local-train-services-resume-in-west-bengal-after-over-7-months/articleshow/79164535.cms?from=mdr,https://www.facebook.com/100048284284069/videos/205325667753575/,https://twitter.com/EasternRailway/status/1327174349753774081,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/23/fact-check-cdc-document-admit-covid-19/,https://t.co/MmcSnBPM6H,https://twitter.com/EasternRailway/status/1327174349753774081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/EasternRailway/status/1327174349753774081,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUUR7wxzMV4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUUR7wxzMV4,https://er.indianrailways.gov.in/tester.jsp?DIVISION_ID=3&STATION_ID=Ranaghat,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-video-does-not-show-exodus-migrants-indias-gujarat-state,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8bfff9eefde4f9cbe8e3eee8e0f2e4fef9edeae8ffa5e8e4e6",Does This Video Show The Day Local Service Resumed At An Indian Train Station During The COVID-19 Pandemic?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Media outlets such as CNN, ABC News, CNBC and CBS News covered the Dow’s performance on Nov. 16.   Fact Check: Two major U.S. stock market indexes, the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record closing highs on Nov. 16 after the pharmaceutical company Moderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing coronavirus infection, Reuters reported. The Dow gained about 471 points, according to The New York Times. A Nov. 17 Facebook post falsely claims mainstream media outlets did not report on the Dow’s record closing number the previous day, saying in part, “Weird… so the DOW hit it’s (sic) highest day EVER in history yesterday and not one MSM outlet reported on it.”  Multiple major media outlets on Nov. 16 published reports on the stock market increase. For instance, CNN published an article with the headline, “Dow and S&P 500 hit new record highs after Moderna says vaccine is 94.5% effective.” ABC News likewise reported on the record numbers, writing: “Dow closes at a record high for first time since February, recouping its pandemic losses, as hopes build for a vaccine.” CNBC, CBS News and Fox Business also published similar reports on the Dow’s performance after Moderna announced its success with a COVID-19 vaccine. (RELATED: Did Facebook Remove The Title Of ‘President’ From Donald Trump’s Page?) The Dow had another significant increase on Tuesday, reaching the milestone of trading above 30,000 points for the first time, The Associated Press reported. The increase came amid optimism about coronavirus vaccine candidates and reports that President-elect Joe Biden would nominate former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen to lead the Treasury Department in January, according to CNBC. Biden became the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 7. The General Services Administration recently informed Biden that it is ready to formally begin the transition process, according to CBS News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jareekneller/posts/10221122766152533,https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-11-16-2020-11605515068?mod=article_inline,https://www.modernatx.com/,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks/us-stocks-sp-500-dow-close-at-all-time-highs-on-reignited-vaccine-hopes-idUSL1N2I22GG,https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-11-16-2020-11605515068?mod=article_inline,https://www.facebook.com/jareekneller/posts/10221122766152533,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/investing/dow-stock-market-today-moderna/index.html,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/dow-closes-record-high-time-february-recouping-pandemic-74240480,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/stock-market-today-live.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stocks-rise-moderna-vaccine-11-16-2020/,https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-stocks-november-16-2020,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/16/fact-check-facebook-remove-president-donald-trumps-page/,https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-coronavirus-pandemic-1ffe68211cea1b15cca00327e67e1ee7,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gsa-chief-allows-biden-transition-formally-begin/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#82f6f0e7f4edf0c2e1eae7e1e9fbedf7f0e4e3e1f6ace1edef",Did No Mainstream Media Outlets Cover The Dow Jones Industrial Average’s Performance On Nov. 16?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The image actually shows viewing stands from former President Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration.   Fact Check: The image shows an aerial view of the White House with what a red circle identifies as a stage being constructed for Biden’s inauguration on the North Lawn. The Associated Press on Nov. 7 announced Biden as the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election. “If you’re having a bad day, just remember, Trump is watching Biden’s inaugural platform being built on the White House North Lawn,” the caption of the image being shared reads. “For the next 59 days.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show ‘Mega Rally’ For Donald Trump In DC?)  The image, however, is not actually from 2020. A reverse image search revealed that the photo was taken during Clinton’s 1993 inauguration and that viewing stands for the inaugural parade, not a stage, are shown in the photo. The 1993 photo can be found on the Smithsonian Institution Archives website. Construction of the stage for the 2021 swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol began Sept. 29, according to WUSA 9. While some D.C. council members, including Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, raised concerns about the safety of the viewing stands during the coronavirus pandemic, the Washington Post reported, construction of the stands is likewise underway. Biden’s inauguration ceremony is scheduled to take place on Jan. 20, 2021, on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video was taken in November 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.   Fact Check: In the video, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and other individuals sing happy birthday to the former vice president. Multiple Facebook users shared the video along with claims it was taken at Biden’s birthday last week. He turned 78 on Nov. 20, according to The Associated Press. “Joe Biden’s birthday and not a single mask or social distancing,” one Facebook user captioned the video on Nov. 20. “People are morons.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Joe Biden In D.C. ‘Last Night’ Without A Mask?)  Though Bottoms tweeted the video on Nov. 20 to wish the president-elect a “VERY Happy Birthday,” it was actually taken in 2019. She clarified in a follow-up tweet that the video was “Pre-Covid.”  Pre-Covid! This was in the @TPStudios White House following the @DNC @msnbc debate on 11/20/19. https://t.co/7IVxsirx2J — Keisha Lance Bottoms (@KeishaBottoms) November 20, 2020  “Pre-Covid!” Bottoms tweeted. “This was in the @TPStudios White House following the @DNC @msnbc debate on 11/20/19.” The dress Bottoms wears in the video she tweeted matches the one she wore on Biden’s birthday last year. It can be seen in an interview the Atlanta mayor did with 11 Alive News on Nov. 20, 2019, the same day as the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate jointly held by MSNBC and the Washington Post. The debate, which occurred on Biden’s 77th birthday, was held at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, according to the Washington Post.  The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in China in late 2019, according to The New York Times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t confirm the U.S.’s first case of COVID-19 until late January, about two months after the video was taken. Biden spent his birthday this year in Wilmington, Delaware, where he met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, according to NBC News. Biden on Nov. 20 tweeted a photo that showed him, Pelosi, Schumer and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wearing masks and practicing social distancing at that meeting.

A spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations confirmed the claim is “entirely false.”   Fact Check: The Facebook post appears to show a screen grab of an article recently published on the website YourNewsWire, with the headline alleging that Soros was “arrested in Philadelphia for election interference.” Soros, a billionaire who has donated to progressive causes through his Open Society Foundations, is often a target of online misinformation. YourNewsWire’s article, which no longer appears to be available, claimed Soros “has been arrested and is currently being held in federal custody” in Philadelphia related to a supposedly “unsealed indictment filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania” that charges Soros with “serious crimes relating to the US election.” The article featured alleged photos of the indictment against Soros.  There is, however, no evidence that Soros has been arrested for election interference nor that the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania has unsealed an indictment against him for such a thing. A reverse image search reveals the indictment pictured in the YourNewsWire article has been altered. In the real federal indictment, charges such as wire fraud, damage to computers, aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting have been leveled against six Russian nationals, not Soros. If Soros had been arrested for election interference, it would surely have been reported by national media outlets, yet no reports could be found. Jonathan Birchall, a spokesperson for Open Society Foundations, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that “this is entirely false.” (RELATED: Does George Soros Own Two Sigma Investments?)

Verdict: False Pelosi’s 2019 financial disclosure form does not show a financial relationship with the election technology firm. Dominion Voting Systems has denied having “company ownership relationships” with Pelosi.   Fact Check: In the weeks following the Nov. 3 election, the election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems has been the target of misinformation related to election fraud. This particular post attempts to link Pelosi to Dominion Voting Systems, alleging, “Pelosi owns stock in Dominion Software that totals the VOTES. Nothing fishy there.” Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos said in a letter responding to a request from the House Committee on Administration that the company is 75.2 percent owned by the private equity firm Staple Street Capital and 12 percent owned by him, according to The Associated Press. He also said that no other investor owns more than a 5 percent state, the outlet reported.  Pelosi’s 2019 financial disclosure form, filed in August of this year, does not show ownership or financial interest in Dominion Voting Systems. She also answered “No” to questions about if she had excluded from the form details of “qualified blind trusts” benefiting her, her spouse or dependent child and about if she had excluded from the form “any other assets, ‘unearned’ income, transactions, or liabilities of a spouse or dependent child because they meet all three tests for exemption.” Dominion Voting Systems states on its website that it has “no company ownership relationships with the Pelosi family, Feinstein family, Clinton Global Initiative, Smartmatic, Scytl, or any ties to Venezuela or Cuba.” A spokesperson for the company also previously told Reuters that it had “no ties to Mr. Pelosi.” The election technology company has received significant media attention due to its involvement in the 2020 election. If Pelosi owned stock in the company, it likely would have been picked up by the media, yet no national news outlets have reported on it. (RELATED: Is Nancy Pelosi The Chief Marketing Officer At Zoom?) Pelosi’s former chief of staff, Nadeam Elshami, was hired as a lobbyist for Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a firm that lobbies on behalf of Dominion Voting Systems, according to Bloomberg Government. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Nov. 1 that Dominion has also used Republican lobbyists such as Jared Thomas, a former staffer for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp when he served as secretary of state.

Neither company has announced global closures, and the companies’ respective executives do not appear to have left their positions.   Fact Check: The image shared in the Nov. 22 Facebook post reads, “Dominion and smartmatic have closed up shop all around the WORLD and all exec’s have gone on the run. What does that tell you???” Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic both specialize in voting-related technology and have been the subject of misinformation on social media following the 2020 presidential election. There is, however, no evidence to support either claim. Both companies have received significant media attention during the election. If either company had “closed up shop” or its executives had “gone on the run” en masse, it likely would have been picked up by national media outlets, yet none have reported on such things occurring. (RELATED: FACT CHECK: Does George Soros Own The Voting Technology Firm Smartmatic?)  Dominion Voting Systems has released a statement, last updated Nov. 21, dispelling a number of falsehoods about the company on social media. One part of the statement reads, “Dominion is not shuttering its offices. Employees have been encouraged to work remotely and protect their social media profiles due to persistent harassment and threats against personal safety.” Check Your Fact didn’t find any national media reports about Dominion founder and chief executive John Poulos going “on the run.” Smartmatic has also released a similar statement dispelling falsehoods promoted on social media. The company, for example, notes that executives Antonio Mugica and Roger Piñate “continue to run the company as CEO and President, respectively.” Smartmatic has posted on its website and social media since Election Day, further adding to the dubiousness of the claim it “up shop all around the WORLD.” Check Your Fact previously addressed a false claim alleging billionaire George Soros owned Smartmatic.

Verdict: False   The tweet came from a now-suspended parody account. Fact Check: The image shows what multiple Facebook users claim is a Nov. 18 tweet from Elizabeth Trump Grau. It has circulated widely in recent days as Donald Trump continues to contest the results of the 2020 president election, despite former Vice President Joe Biden being projected as the winner.  “This election inspired me to break my silence and speak out on behalf of my family,” Elizabeth Trump Grau supposedly tweeted. “My brother Don won this election and will fight this to the very end. We’ve always been a family of fighters. We are all so very proud of him and the job he has done for our country. 4 MORE YEARS!” Conservative radio host Wayne Dupree’s website published an article reporting, based on the alleged tweet, that the president’s sister had issued a “rare and bold statement on [the] 2020 election” and proved “how much she believes in her brother.” Donald Trump retweeted the article on Nov. 20, commenting, “Thank you Elizabeth, LOVE!” In reality, the pictured tweet comes from a parody account, @TheBettyTrump, that has no apparent affiliation with Elizabeth Trump Grau. The account updated its Twitter bio, according to Business Insider, and tweeted to clarify that it was a parody account prior to it being suspended for violating Twitter rules. (RELATED: Does Chapter 45 Of Donald Trump’s ‘The Art Of The Deal’ Tell Readers To ‘Never Admit Defeat’?) “I would’ve clarified sooner that I was a parody but I certainly didn’t anticipate President Trump himself taking notice of the account,” the person behind the account tweeted, according to the Wayback Machine. “Don’t blame @WayneDupreeShow… it’s on me for not making that clear. Hope y’all will forgive me – feel bad for creating any confusion. LOVE!” Dupree’s website updated its article to reflect that “the account we claimed was ‘Elizabeth Trump’ in this article was, in fact, a ‘parody’ account.” A woman who identified herself as Trump’s sister to Vice News told the outlet on Friday that she’s “trying to delete” the parody account and that she doesn’t “belong to Twitter.” The Washington Post reported in late August that Elizabeth Trump Grau “has stayed out of the public eye.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/nkem.ojionu/posts/3627255813998699,https://www.facebook.com/nkem.ojionu/posts/3627255813998699,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-trump-us-election-news-11-23-20/h_ceaf3dcc5b2191fecd0147671a12c22d,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-wins-presidency-trump-fox-news-projects,https://www.facebook.com/nkem.ojionu/posts/3627255813998699,https://web.archive.org/web/20201119041422/https://www.waynedupree.com/2020/11/elizabeth-trump-election/,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1329771800369225729,https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/thank-you-elizabeth-love-trump-thanks-parody-twitter-account-he-thought-was-his-sister/articleshow/79332200.cms,https://web.archive.org/web/20201120175956/https://twitter.com/TheBettyTrump/status/1329846849210114052,https://twitter.com/TheBettyTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1329885909400100864%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftrump-sister-elizabeth-tweet-links-to-fake-news-site-2020-11,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/11/fact-check-donald-trump-art-deal-chapter-45-never-admit-defeat/,https://web.archive.org/web/20201120175956/https://twitter.com/TheBettyTrump/status/1329846849210114052,https://www.waynedupree.com/2020/11/elizabeth-trump-election/,https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqpm3/trump-thought-his-secretive-sister-finally-joined-maga-twitter-so-we-called-her,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/maryanne-trump-barry-secret-recordings/2020/08/22/30d457f4-e334-11ea-ade1-28daf1a5e919_story.html,https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/factchat/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f4f2e5f6eff2c0e3e8e5e3ebf9eff5f2e6e1e3f4aee3efed","Did Elizabeth Trump Grau Send This Tweet In Support Of Her Brother, Donald Trump?",,,,,,

At least two other presidents-elect, as well as the General Services Administration (GSA), have used the term in the past.   Fact Check: The image shows Biden speaking with “Office of the President Elect” branding on a podium in front of him and a sign behind him. The caption accompanying the photo suggests that the former vice president invented the term. While there isn’t an official federal “Office of the President Elect,” the informal title for the president-elect’s transition team was not invented by Biden. The term has previously been used by President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A ‘MAGA March’ In New Orleans?)  For instance, Trump used “Office of the President Elect” branding during a Jan. 11, 2017 news conference in New York, according to a photo available on Getty Images. Photos from Reuters show Obama standing in front of podiums with similar branding in November 2008. The GSA has also used the term “Office of the President-elect” on occasion, including in the recent “Memorandum of Understanding between the General Services Administration and Joseph R. Biden, Jr.” That memo states that “the Presidential Transition Act, as amended, authorizes the Administrator to seek an appropriation for the purposes of the transition of the Executive Branch of the Government in an election year, some of which is designated specifically for use at the request of the President-elect and Vice President-elect (referred collectively herein as the Office of the President-elect).” Another instance appears in a GSA order posted in June 2012. The House Committee on Ethics in December 2016 sent out a memo that employed the term in reference to Trump’s transition team, stating that the “Office of the President-elect, however, must reimburse the House for the salaries of the detailed employees.” Biden became the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 7, The Associated Press reported. Fox News, CNN and ABC News project that Biden has 306 electoral votes, while Trump has 232. The Electoral College electors are scheduled to vote on Dec. 14, according to The Associated Press.

Fact Check:   Supporters of President Donald Trump gathered in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 14 for the “Million MAGA March” to protest against the projected win for President-elect Joe Biden, according to CBS News. The image being shared claims the “DC Park Service” estimated less than 12,000 people attended the march. The “DC Park Service” does not exist. The post appears to be referencing the National Park Service (NPS) which maintains U.S. national parks such as those in D.C. The NPS, however, no longer makes estimates for crowd sizes, Mike Litterst, chief of communications for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, told Check Your Fact via email. “Due to the difficulty in accurately assessing crowd size for large events, most notably following 1995’s Million Man March, the National Park Service no longer makes crowd estimates for events,” Litterst said. “No estimate was made for Saturday’s event.”  The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) likewise does not estimate crowd sizes, MPD spokesperson Alaina Gertz said in an email. (RELATED: No, This Photo Does Not Show The ‘Million MAGA March’ In DC) The claim may originate from a permit given to the organizers of the event from the NPS. A copy of the permit obtained by WUSA 9 shows the “Anticipated Number or Participants” for the event in Freedom Plaza is 10,000. The permit accounts for the number of attendees in Freedom Plaza, but does not appear to account for demonstrators who gathered outside of the plaza. The exact size of the “Million MAGA March” crowd is unknown, though Reuters debunked the claim that a million people attended the march. CBS News reported that “thousands” of people showed up, while USA Today reported that “tens of thousands” attended the “Million MAGA March.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The image being shared appears to show an article published in the U.K.-based monthly newspaper The Light, which describes itself as a “truthpaper.” (RELATED: Did The CDC Release Data Showing Face Masks Are ‘Collecting’ COVID-19?) The Light’s article alleges that the CDC admitted in a July document – “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel” – that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 does not exist. As evidence of its claim, the article points to a sentence on page 39 of the CDC document, which states, “Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA.”  The CDC document has been misinterpreted. The section referenced in The Light’s article is “describing what was used to determine the lowest amount of viral genetic material the RT-PCR assay could detect” in the CDC’s diagnostic COVID-19 test, Dr. Thushan de Silva, a senior clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at the University of Sheffield, said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. De Silva explained that the CDC “used ‘transcribed’ RNA as the positive control to do this – which means they used synthetically produced genetic material identical to that carried by the virus.” “To calculate the limit of detection of an RT-PCR assay, you need to have a known quantity of virus to extract genetic material (RNA) from, or alternatively a known quantity of RNA identical to that carried by the virus,” de Silva told the DCNF in an email. “The likely reason that they used transcribed RNA would have been that at the time of set up, not many standardised and quantified viral stocks would have been available to extract viral RNA from.” “CDC developed its diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, before live virus or any samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients were available for CDC use,” Jasmine Reed, a CDC public affairs specialist, clarified in an email to the DCNF. “CDC uses a test that was developed from genomic sequencing information, without using live virus or samples from patients. By January 18, 2020, CDC was using this test on samples from people with suspected cases of COVID-19.” She also noted that “the FDA Instructions for Use reflect that the test was developed based on genomic sequencing information that was available before the CDC acquired live virus.” (RELATED: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Claims Moderna And Pfizer ‘Were Not Involved In Operation Warp Speed’) A timeline of “SARS-CoV-2 Viral Culturing at CDC” is available on the CDC’s website. The CDC used a “respiratory sample from the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States to culture (or grow) the SARS-CoV-2 virus on January 22, 2020” and now “routinely grows SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples after they have been confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2” for uses including “developing additional SARS-CoV-2 tests, testing medicines to treat or prevent infections with the virus that causes COVID-19s, and developing vaccines,” according to Reed. “Using transcribed RNA rather than RNA extracted from quantified viral stocks is no reason to question the existence of SARS-CoV-2,” de Silva said. “There are now hundreds of stocks of cultured SARS-CoV-2 in laboratories around the world.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The internet has become replete with allegations of voter fraud taking place during the 2020 election. Supporters of Trump gathered in Freedom Plaza in D.C. on Nov. 14 for the “Million MAGA March,” a protest against the alleged fraud, according to USA Today. A Nov. 17 Facebook post includes an image, purportedly from a “Trump mega rally,” that shows thousands of people packed close together on the National Mall. Text in the image reads: “Trump mega rally in Washington. Tell me again he lost!!!!  But the photo is not actually from the “Million MAGA March,” or any other Trump rally. A reverse image search conducted by Check Your Fact revealed that the image was taken at Obama’s first presidential inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, 2009. (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) “People gather on the National Mall during the inaugural ceremony for Barack Obama as 44th US president at the US Capitol in Washington on January 20, 2009,” the Getty Images caption reads. “Two million people erupted in joyous celebration, cheering and waving a sea of flags as Barack Obama took the oath of office as the first black president of the United States.” The exact size of the crowd that attended the “Million Maga March” is uncertain, though PolitiFact debunked the claim that crowd sizes reached one million. CBS News reported that there were “a few thousand” attendees, while USA Today estimated “tens of thousands” of Trump supporters were in attendance.      share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/adrian.paull.5/posts/10217307314025863,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/06/fact-check-election-fraud-voting/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/14/trump-rally-washington-dc-million-maga-march-updates/6283411002/,https://www.facebook.com/adrian.paull.5/posts/10217307314025863,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/06/fact-check-election-fraud-voting/,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/people-gather-on-the-national-mall-during-the-inaugural-news-photo/84374977?irgwc=1&esource=AFF_GI_IR_TinEye_77643&asid=TinEye&cid=GI&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=TinEye&utm_content=77643,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/16/kayleigh-mcenany/million-maga-march-did-not-have-more-1-million-att/,https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-supporters-gather-for-million-maga-march/#x,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/14/trump-rally-washington-dc-million-maga-march-updates/6283411002/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2d6d0c7d4cdd0e2c1cac7c1c9dbcdd7d0c4c3c1d68cc1cdcf",Does This Photo Show A ‘Mega Rally’ For Donald Trump In DC?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Local election officials in Philadelphia and Merlino’s attorney have stated the claim is untrue. The claim originated from a website that has a history of publishing misinformation.   Fact Check: The Facebook user links to an article, titled “EXCLUSIVE: How a Philly mob boss stole the election – and why he may flip on Joe Biden,” that the Buffalo Chronicle published on Nov. 14. The article alleges, citing anonymous sources, that the Biden campaign paid reputed Philadelphia crime boss Joseph “Skinny Joe” Merlino $3 million to mark 300,000 blank ballots for Biden and drop them off at the Philadelphia Convention Center. The Buffalo Chronicle’s article was tweeted by Jordan Sekulow, the son of one of President Donald Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow. NewsGuard, a company that evaluates the trustworthiness of news websites, reported that the website has previously published misinformation.  There is no evidence to support claims that Merlino manufactured Pennsylvania ballots for Biden during the 2020 election. Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt said in a CNN interview Nov. 11 that the election was secure and referred to fraud claims being spread on social media as “completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all.” Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner spokesperson Jane Roh also told Fox News that the claim was not true, saying, “This claim published by a disreputable website has been thoroughly debunked.” “My client categorically denies all the allegations and Joey would rather die than ever be a snitch,” attorney John Meringolo, who represents Merlino, said in a statement to The New York Daily News. (RELATED: Did Election Workers In Philadelphia Stop Counting Mail-In Ballots On Election Night?) Merlino has been on supervised release in Florida since late last year, according to Philly Voice. He previously pleaded guilty to illegal betting in 2018 to avoid retrial in racketeering case, The Associated Press reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsVarun HukeriGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Varun on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4042006385816047&set=a.186653771351347&type=3&theater,https://buffalochronicle.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-how-a-philly-mob-boss-stole-the-election-and-why-he-may-flip-on-joe-biden/?fbclid=IwAR05gP6MfSxSq9J7_0uCFrkruBPAeYcTW1u9tZAkD8NfEgRAsrsooY5KUAg,https://buffalochronicle.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-how-a-philly-mob-boss-stole-the-election-and-why-he-may-flip-on-joe-biden/?fbclid=IwAR05gP6MfSxSq9J7_0uCFrkruBPAeYcTW1u9tZAkD8NfEgRAsrsooY5KUAg,https://apnews.com/article/e1995ec6a09e48eb9e436ea4ac66e397,https://twitter.com/JordanSekulow/status/1328333438068396033,https://twitter.com/JaySekulow?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.newsguardtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/buffalochronicle-1.pdf,https://www.philadelphiavotes.com/en/about-us/commissioner-al-schmidt,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2011/11/crn.01.html,https://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/aboutus/Pages/DistrictAttorney.aspx,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mob-boss-denies-philadelphia-election-joe-biden-mans-man,https://meringololaw.com/john-meringolo/,https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-trump-election-conspiracy-philadelphia-mobster-20201117-wu7v2vwq65el5cflrscxjnoari-story.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/04/fact-check-philadelphia-stop-counting-ballots-election-night/,https://www.phillyvoice.com/joey-merlino-philadelphia-mob-trump-biden-election-fraud-lawsuits-2020/,https://apnews.com/article/e1995ec6a09e48eb9e436ea4ac66e397,https://www.twitter.com/varunhukeri","Was A Philadelphia Mob Boss Hired To Produce 300,000 Ballots For Joe Biden?",,,,,,

Fact Check: Gates is a vocal proponent of vaccinations and invests billions of dollars in their development and distribution through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a private charitable organization. The image shared on Facebook features a headshot of Gates along with a quote attributed to him that reads, “Only the people who have all the vaccines will still be able to move freely.” There is, however, no evidence that Gate ever made such a statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no media reports linking the quote to Gates. A search of his books, “The Road Ahead” and “Business @ The Speed of Thought,” as well as his personal blog, likewise turned up no instances of the quote. (RELATED: Are Bill Gates And The Coronavirus On The Australian $10 Banknote?)  The quote appears to be a misinterpretation of a statement Gates made while participating in an online TedTalk in March 2020. Gates discusses options for how countries can handle the coronavirus pandemic and at one point states, “Eventually, what we’ll have to have is certificates of who is a recovered person, who is a vaccinated person, because you don’t want people moving around the world — where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control, sadly — you don’t want to completely block off the ability for those people to go there and come back and move around.” While Gates contemplates the connection between vaccinations and travel, he clearly states that he does not want to completely limit people’s ability to move based solely on their vaccination status, contrary to the quote attributed to him on Facebook.

Verdict: False Voting data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections shows the vote counts for the two gubernatorial candidates does not exceed the number of people who voted in state elections. About 5.54 million ballots in the state were cast in the 2020 general election, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections.   Fact Check: The Nov. 4 post attempts to compare vote counts for Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican challenger Dan Forest to the alleged number of people that voted to suggest there is a discrepancy indicative of voter fraud in the state. “OK so Cooper got 2.803,474 votes and Dan got 2.562,116, but 4.5 million voted in NC, so there’s an extra half million votes here, where did the extra votes come from when only 4.5 million voted in NC?” reads the post. “Should I say cheating like mail in ballots ????? The votes added up to 5.365,590.”  Another iteration of the claim reads, “Well riddle me this North Carolina??? Total combined votes for Cooper & Forest is over 5.2 million votes. However only 4.5 million votes were actually cast. Where did the extra half million votes come from?” However, unofficial voting data available on the North Carolina State Board of Elections website shows that the combined vote counts for Cooper and Forest do not actually exceed the number of people who voted in state elections by 500,000 votes. (RELATED: Viral Image Shows Outdated Voter Registration Numbers in 8 States) Unofficial data from Nov. 16 on the North Carolina State Board of Elections website shows that about 5.54 million ballots were cast in the 2020 general election out of some 7.36 million registered voters. Approximately 5.52 million people voted in the presidential election as of Nov. 20, with over 2.7 million voting for President Donald Trump and over 2.6 million voting for President-elect Joe Biden, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. The Senate election saw over 2.6 million ballots cast for Republican incumbent Thom Tillis and over 2.5 million ballots cast for Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, plus over 239,000 ballots cast for third-party candidates. 5,502,785 ballots were cast in North Carolina’s gubernatorial election as of Nov. 20, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections website. Cooper, who won reelection, received 2,834,797 votes, while Forest received 2,586,607. Libertarian Party candidate Steven DiFiore and Constitution Party candidate Al Pisano received 60,448 and 20,933 votes respectively as of Nov. 20, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. It’s unclear where exactly the post’s 4.5 million figure originates. The claim may have arisen from confusion about early voting figures reported before Election Day. The Charlotte Observer, for instance, reported Nov. 2 that over 4.5 million votes in North Carolina had already been cast, either through in-person early voting or through absentee ballot.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The graphic isn’t an authentic advertisement for Moms Demand Action, according to the group’s founder.   Fact Check: An image on Facebook purports to show a graphic from the organization Moms Demand Action featuring a black man with a Moms Demand Action logo superimposed next to him. “Would you sell this man a gun?” text in the image reads. “We wouldn’t either. Demand Universal Background Checks Now!” Moms Demand Action is an anti-gun-violence group that was founded in 2012 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, according to the group’s website. One of the issues the group advocates for is to update the laws regarding background checks and gun ownership.  “Background checks are the foundation of any effort to reduce gun violence across America,” the group’s website asserts. “The system works—more than 3.5 million illegal gun sales have been blocked in the past 20 years.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A Protester Pointing A Weapon At An Armed Homeowner?) But the image is not a genuine graphic from Moms Demand Action. An internet search by Check Your Fact found no evidence linking the image to the organization. Nor does the graphic appear in any of the group’s social media posts. Shannon Watts, the founder of the organization, denied the authenticity of the graphic in an April 18 tweet, writing, “I can’t believe I even have to say this – particularly given the sad ass font they used – but this racist meme is obviously not a @MomsDemand graphic.”    share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/chris.pool.5201/posts/2836827586574680,https://www.facebook.com/chris.pool.5201/posts/2836827586574680,https://www.facebook.com/chris.pool.5201/posts/2836827586574680,https://momsdemandaction.org/shannon-watts/,https://momsdemandaction.org/work/update-background-checks/,https://momsdemandaction.org/work/update-background-checks/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/10/fact-check-photo-protester-pointing-weapon-armed-homeowner/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Moms+Demand+Action+%22Would+you+sell+this+man+a+gun%3F%22&oq=Moms+Demand+&aqs=chrome.1.69i59l2j69i57j0l2j69i60l3.4248j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://twitter.com/search?q=Would%20you%20sell%20this%20man%20a%20gun%3F%20(from%3AMomsDemand)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/300719666712627/search/?q=%20%22Would%20you%20sell%20this%20man%20a%20gun%3F%22,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Would+you+sell+this+man+a+gun%3F%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmomsdemand%2F&oq=%22Would+you+sell+this+man+a+gun%3F%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmomsdemand%2F&aqs=chrome..69i57.3541j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/1251526115824250881,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#62161007140d1022010a0701091b0d1710040301164c010d0f",Is This Image An Advertisement For Moms Demand Action?,,,,,,

The pictured Parler account is fake, according to a Biden campaign spokesperson.   Fact Check: The image appears to show a lengthy message that Biden allegedly posted on the social media platform Parler. In the post, Biden purportedly vowed that he has “committed to healing our nation” and mentioned two measures exemplifying his efforts. “The ‘Subjugation Reparations Act’ will be enacted to include both Federal and State taxes will be abated, at Zero Percent, for the next 89 years for all black families in America,” the message reads, in part. “I will also be signing an executive order renaming the Washington Monument to the BLM Tower.” (RELATED: Has Joe Biden Proposed An Annual 3% Federal Tax On Homes?)  There is, however, no evidence Biden actually posted the statement on Parler. The account, which bears the handle @DemocraticParty, does not have any sort of verification badge and was created 12 days ago. Biden also does not appear to have made the statement in the Parler post during speeches or on Twitter, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Biden has pledged to address systemic racism, saying in his Nov. 7 speech after being projected the winner of the election that he hopes to “achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country,” according to a transcript. His campaign website describes “The Biden Plan for Black America” and “The Biden Plan to Build Back Better by Advancing Racial Equity Across the American Economy.” Neither plan mentions doing away with taxes on black families for over 80 years or renaming the Washington Monument. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign confirmed the account is fake and that Biden did not make the statement on Parler or elsewhere.

It appears to have been fabricated.   Fact Check: The allegedly screen grabbed tweet reads, “WE ARE STILL WINNING! @TrueNorthPolitics on Instagram is posting PROOF of voter fraud I need you ALL to go check it out! Help out a patriot!” The mentioned Instagram account @TrueNorthPolitics, which is currently private, describes itself as providing “Election Updates” and “News,Memes,Videos.” There is, however, no record of Trump sending the pictured tweet. It appears on neither the president’s Twitter timeline nor in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. The tweet appears to have been fabricated using a tweet generator website, with it possibly being shared on social media in an attempt to gain more followers for the mentioned account. (RELATED: Did Kayleigh McEnany Tweet, ‘Retweet If We Should Release The Kraken’?)  Since Election Day on Nov. 3, Trump has on several occasions tweeted that he won the presidential election, despite President-elect Joe Biden being declared the projected winner on Nov. 7 by media outlets such as The Associated Press, Fox News and CNN. Biden’s projected victory came after outlets called the race in Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes for him. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council issued a joint statement on Nov. 12 that said “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley DevlinGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Bradley on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/SublimeRevolver/posts/3655327101200140,https://www.facebook.com/SublimeRevolver/posts/3655327101200140,https://www.instagram.com/truenorthpolitics/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22check%20it%20out%22%20(from%3ArealDonaldTrump)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/POTUS,https://tweetgen.com/create/tweet.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/18/fact-check-kayleigh-mcenany-tweet-release-kraken/,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1328200072987893762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1328200072987893762%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2FrealDonaldTrump2Fstatus2F1328200072987893762widget%3DTweet,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1328361451497664512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1328361451497664512%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2FrealDonaldTrump2Fstatus2F1328361451497664512widget%3DTweet,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-wins-presidency-trump-fox-news-projects,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-biden-election-results-11-07-20/index.html,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election,https://twitter.com/bradleydevlin",Did Donald Trump Send This Tweet About A Specific Instagram Page And Voter Fraud?,,,,,,
260,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/19/fact-check-msnbc-joy-reid-moderna-pfizer-operation-warp-speed/,MSNBC’s Joy Reid Claims Moderna And Pfizer ‘Were Not Involved In Operation Warp Speed’,2020-11-19,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: MSNBC’s Joy Reid Claims Moderna And Pfizer ‘Were Not Involved In Operation Warp Speed’5:11 PM 11/19/2020Elias Atienza | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsDuring a Nov. 17 segment, MSNBC’s Joy Reid claimed the pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer “were not involved in Operation Warp Speed.”  Verdict: False Moderna and Pfizer are both involved to some extent in Operation Warp Speed, according to spokespeople from the respective companies. Moderna received funding through Operation Warp Speed to help develop and test the vaccine the company jointly developed with scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, while Pfizer participates as a supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.   Fact Check: Reid, the MSNBC host of the show “The ReidOut,” made the claim after Pfizer and Moderna respectively announced this month that they had developed COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said in a Nov. 18 press release that its vaccine is 95 percent effective, while Moderna has said its vaccine is nearly 95 percent effective, according to The Washington Post. In the segment, Reid said, “I just want to fact check real quick and remind you all that the companies themselves that are producing these vaccines were not involved in Operation Warp Speed, and have said as much, so that’s a lie.” The statement came after she played a montage of Republican senators appearing to give credit to the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed for the pharmaceutical companies’ developments.  Her statement, however, is inaccurate and lacks important context. Moderna and Pfizer have both participated to some degree in Operation Warp Speed, the federal government’s initiative to quickly develop and bring to market a safe COVID-19 vaccine. (RELATED: Fact-Checking Rachel Maddow’s Math On Potential COVID-19 Herd Immunity Deaths) Moderna received nearly $1 billion from the federal government through Operation Warp Speed to help develop and test its COVID-19 vaccine, The New York Times reported. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also announced in August up to about $1.5 billion to “support the large-scale manufacturing and delivery” of Moderna’s vaccine, according to an HHS fact sheet on Operation Warp Speed. In an Aug. 11 press release, HHS explained that Moderna’s vaccine “has been co-developed by Moderna and scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)” and that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority “supported phase 2/3 clinical trials, vaccine manufacturing scale up and other development activities for this vaccine.” A spokesperson for Moderna confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the pharmaceutical company is “part of Operation Warp Speed.” Pfizer, unlike Moderna, did not take money from the federal government for the development and testing of its vaccine, according to CNN. However, the company is part of Operation Warp Speed as a “supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine,” according to a company statement provided to Check Your Fact by spokesperson Sharon Castillo. In July, it reached a $1.95 billion agreement with the U.S. government through Operation Warp Speed to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine, if approved by Food and Drug Administration, according to a Pfizer press release and The New York Times. “Pfizer is proud to be one of various vaccine manufacturers participating in Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine,” the company statement provided to Check Your Fact says. “Pfizer has self-funded all of its COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing costs. Under its agreement with the U.S. government, Pfizer will only receive payment for successful delivery of vaccine doses, following regulatory authorization or approval.” Reid’s claim may have stemmed from Pfizer seeming to previously attempt to distance itself from Operation Warp Speed. Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development, had told The New York Times that the company was “never part of the Warp Speed” and that it has “never taken money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.” However, a Pfizer spokesperson more recently told CNN and The New York Times that Jansen was referring to the research and development of Pfizer’s vaccine. During the Nov. 18 episode of her show, Reid said, “I should correct what we reported last night, Moderna did receive funding from the administration’s Operation Warp Speed to develop the vaccine, Pfizer did not.” MSNBC did not respond to Check Your Fact’s inquiry about whether Reid would acknowledge that Pfizer participates in Operation Warp Speed as a supplier by the time of publication. (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) Pfizer said on Wednesday that it plans to apply for emergency use authorization with the FDA “within days,” according to CBS News. Moderna is also expected to submit its vaccine testing data to the FDA soon, the Wall Street Journal reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Carrey, an award-winning actor known for his roles in films such as “Man on the Moon” and “Bruce Almighty,” has published dozens of cartoons sharing his political views. An image on Facebook shows a picture of Carrey next to a quote attributed to him that reads, “The virus has proved that the entire world can be easily manipulated through fear by simply controlling media, academia, and medicine.” “Don’t usually agree with Jim Carey’s (sic) political views, but wow! He’s spot on here!” the photo’s caption reads. (RELATED: Did Jim Carrey Say, ‘Hollywood Elites Eat Whole Babies For Christmas’?)  But there is no evidence that Carrey ever made such a statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no media reports linking the comment to Carrey. In fact, similar quotes to the one attributed to Carrey have been shared on Facebook since at least March 2020. Many times, the quote was shared with no attribution. Carrey has tweeted about COVID-19 on a number of occasions, usually accompanied with a political cartoon he created. The quote attributed to him in the Facebook post, however, could not be found on his Twitter account, @JimCarrey. Carrey does not appear to have other social media accounts. Carrey’s publicist Marleah Leslie confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the actor had not said such a quote, saying, “The quote you are referring to was not made by my client Jim Carrey.”   Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False The photo actually shows a June 2 protest against police brutality in Paris, France.   Fact Check: Thousands of Trump supporters gathered in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 14 for the “Million MAGA March” in protest against the projected victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, CBS News reported. A post on Facebook shares an image, seemingly of a similar event held in New Orleans, showing “hundreds of thousands” of people marching in the streets. “Maga March in New Orleans,” the post’s caption reads. “We have hundreds of thousands marching for our President in all states. Never seen this much support for a president since Reagan no way no how you will ever make me believe that Biden won.” (RELATED: Image Claims To Show An Article Reporting Justin Trudeau ‘Promises Military Intervention If Trump Refuses To Leave Office’)  However, the photo is not from a “MAGA March,” nor was it taken in New Orleans. In fact, there have been no national media reports of such large demonstrations taking place in New Orleans on Nov. 14. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image search and found that the photo was actually included in a June 2 Associated Press article about international protests that occurred in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. “Protesters gather Tuesday, June 2, 2020 in Paris,” the Associated Press caption reads. “Thousands of people defied a police ban and converged on the main Paris courthouse for a demonstration to show solidarity with U.S. protesters and denounce the death of a black man in French police custody. The demonstration was organized to honor Frenchman Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against George Floyd’s death.”    share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ljinright/posts/10223719587555808,https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-supporters-gather-for-million-maga-march/,https://www.facebook.com/ljinright/posts/10223719587555808,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/17/fact-check-justin-trudeau-military-intervention-donald-trump-presidential-election-2020/,https://www.google.com/search?biw=1310&bih=686&tbm=nws&ei=9Jq0X4btB82e-gT92LAo&q=New+Orleans+MAGA+march&oq=New+Orleans+MAGA+march&gs_l=psy-ab.3...130904.138385.0.138728.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.OLt_iJfDVFA,https://apnews.com/article/f01b2aff643b80533b53a04f2909de06,https://apnews.com/article/f01b2aff643b80533b53a04f2909de06/gallery/84b8444b6070497e880dd385956bdcb3,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d797f687b627f4d6e65686e667462787f6b6c6e79236e6260",Does This Photo Show A ‘MAGA March’ In New Orleans?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Erdogan and Macron shook hands moments before the photo being shared was taken.   Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users shared the photo with the claim it shows Erdogan refusing to shake hands with Macron amid recent tensions between Turkey and France. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show The Teacher Beheaded In France Holding A ‘Refugees Welcome’ Sign?) Following the beheading of Paris school teacher Samuel Paty by a Chechen refugee, Macron said that Islam was “in crisis” and that he would fight “Islamist separatism” in France, Business Insider reported. Erdogan on Oct. 24 said, according to Politico, that the French president “needs mental treatment” for his views about Islam and on Oct. 26 advocated for Turks to boycott French products, according to BBC News.  The photo, taken by Ludovic Marin for AFP, shows Macron as he meets with Erdogan “at the UN headquarters during the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York City on September 25, 2018,” according to its caption. In the picture, Macron has his right hand extended, while Erdogan appears to face away from it. Some Facebook users falsely claimed it depicted Erdogan refusing to shake Macron’s hand, despite other AFP photos showing the two leaders doing so during the same occasion. Turkey’s Directorate of Communications also tweeted the day after the meeting a photo of the pair shaking hands.

The tweet comes from an unverified Twitter account that has since been suspended.   Fact Check: Giuliani has made multiple claims about widespread election fraud affecting the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, despite many of his allegations having already been thoroughly debunked, according to The New York Times. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council issued a joint statement last week that said “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Nonetheless, an image being widely shared on Facebook claims to show a screen grab of a tweet from Giuliani claiming he and Sidney Powell, former federal prosecutor and current Michael Flynn attorney, have found “substantial evidence of fraud.” (RELATED: Did The US Army Seize Servers From Dominion Voting Systems In Germany?)  “Stay tuned for big news tomorrow,” the alleged tweet reads. “@SidneyPowell1 and I have substantial evidence of fraud and I can confirm that we have Dominion in our hands and are analyzing the logs. It will expose fraud to such extent it will be irrefutable that @realDonaldTrump won in a landslide.” Dominion Voting Systems is an election technology supplier whose equipment is used in counties and states across the U.S. In the wake of the election, the company has become the target of unfounded rumors that it has been involved in voter fraud. While Giuliani has previously tweeted about Dominion Voting Systems, there is no record of him sending the pictured tweet. It can be found on neither his verified Twitter account, @RudyGiuliani, nor in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. A closer examination of the screen grabbed tweet shows that it comes from the wrong handle, @RudyGiulianl. The account is unverified and appears to have since been suspended. This isn’t the first time social media users have mistaken an unverified Twitter account resembling that of a public figure as the official Twitter account of said public figure. Check Your Fact on Wednesday debunked a screen grab of a tweet from the Twitter handle @PressSecKay that many Facebook users mistook as belonging to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

Verdict: False The photo shows an aerial view of the 2017 Women’s March on Washington.   Fact Check: Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump on Nov. 14 participated in the “Million MAGA March” in Washington to protest against the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, CNN reported. Trump briefly waved at people congregating for the march from his motorcade, according to CBS News. Facebook users falsely alleged in posts that a photo of a massive crowd on the National Mall and nearby streets showed a scene from the “Million MAGA March,” despite the picture coming from an 2017 event. One such post’s caption reads, “MILLION MAGA MARCH…largest Republican gathering in history.”  (RELATED: Did Facebook Remove The Title Of ‘President’ From Donald Trump’s Page?)  The aerial-view photo shows the Women’s March on Washington, a rally that had at least an estimated 470,000 attendees the day after Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, according to The New York Times. The verified Women’s March Twitter account tweeted video of the Washington rally on July 21 that year with the caption commemorating the event’s six-month anniversary, crediting the Twitter user @KerryGFleming with taking the footage.

The tents can be seen in what appears to be the same location in a screen grab of the EarthCam feed CNN took just before the Women’s March and published in an article comparing the crowd sizes of the Women’s March and the inauguration. People in the image being shared also appear to be wearing pink “pussy hats” that, according to NBC News, many Women’s March attendees wore in 2017.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/cindy.trimble/posts/10216635541793369,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/14/us/trump-washington-voters-rally-far-right/index.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/million-maga-march-washington-dc-trumps-motorcade-passes-supporters/,https://www.facebook.com/cindy.trimble/posts/10216635541793369,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/16/fact-check-facebook-remove-president-donald-trumps-page/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html,https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/888419693723299841,https://twitter.com/kerrygfleming,https://twitter.com/hashtag/6MonthsSinceWomensMarch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/kerrygfleming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/GMGqk2aoT1,https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/888419693723299841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/888419693723299841,https://www.facebook.com/cindy.trimble/posts/10216635541793369,https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-donald-trump-inauguration-sizes/index.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/inauguration-2017/women-s-march-washington-echoed-cities-around-world-n710156,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8bcbaadbea7ba88aba0adaba3b1a7bdbaaea9abbce6aba7a5",Image Falsely Claims To Show The ‘Million Maga March’ Recently Held In DC,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows Romanian law enforcement officers removing soccer fans from a Bucharest subway station, not Paris police clashing with refugees.   Fact Check: The 81-second video shows a group of police outfitted in riot gear gathering on a train platform, where they proceed to remove passengers from the subway train and push them to the ground. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Paris Church Bells Ringing To Celebrate Joe Biden’s Election?) The caption for this particular post alleges the video shows Paris police “knock some manners” into refugees who were “spitting on people in the underground.” Another Facebook user who shared the video claimed those targeted by the police were Muslims, saying, “In Paris Muslims without masks in Metro spit on the other passengers. See what police did to them.”  But neither of those accounts are accurate. The Daily Caller News Foundation traced the video to several Romanian news reports that explain it actually shows Romanian law enforcement officers having physical confrontations with local soccer fans. The incident captured in the viral video occurred in early October at the Ştefan cel Mare metro station in Bucharest after two groups of rival soccer fans clashed with each other, according to roughly-translated Romanian media reports and a statement from Bucharest authorities.  “Following this conflict, about 30 people were driven to the police station in order to take legal action,” the roughly-translated statement says. “Several objects banned for ownership were found in the subway area, which could jeopardize the safety of people.” Physical confrontations have previously broken out among soccer fans in Romania, according to The Mirror.

The tweet came from a parody account that has since been suspended.   Fact Check: The image seemingly shows a screen grab of a tweet McEnany allegedly sent at 3:58 a.m. on Nov. 17. The supposed tweet reads, “WE WON HUGE, 73,000,000+ LEGAL VOTES. #Winning RETWEET if we should RELEASE THE KRAKEN.” (RELATED: Did Kayleigh McEnany Give Lesley Stahl A Blank Book Of The Trump Administration’s Health Care Achievements?) There is, however, no evidence McEnany ever sent the tweet. Check Your Fact searched both of McEnany’s verified Twitter accounts – @PressSec and @kayleighmcenany – but didn’t find any matches for the pictured message. ProPublica’s archive of the press secretary’s deleted tweets likewise yielded no results. A closer examination of the tweet reveals it comes from the wrong handle, @PressSecKay.  The unverified Twitter account @PressSecKay described itself as an “unofficial parody account” in its Twitter biography, an archived version of its timeline shows. The parody account, which has since been suspended, used the same picture that McEnany uses on her press secretary account as well as a similar handle, likely causing confusion among social media users. The phrase “Release the Kraken” appears to reference former federal prosecutor and current Michael Flynn attorney Sidney Powell using the term during a Nov. 14 interview on “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” Powell, one of the attorneys on President Donald Trump’s legal team contesting the 2020 presidential election results, used the phrase in reference to the supposed future release of evidence which she alleged would prove the unfounded theory that widespread voting fraud occurred, according to Newsweek. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council issued a joint statement last week that said “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Election officials in dozens of states also told The New York Times that there is no evidence “fraud or other irregularities” affected the outcome of the presidential election.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsDominick PorcellaContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=190340972589744&set=a.186485666308608&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=190340972589744&set=a.186485666308608&type=3,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/26/fact-check-kayleigh-mcenany-lesley-stahl-book-blank-trump-health-care/,https://twitter.com/search?q=Kraken%20(from%3APressSec)&src=typed_query,https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=Kraken%20(from%3Akayleighmcenany)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/PressSec,https://twitter.com/PressSecKay,https://web.archive.org/web/20201117101915/https://twitter.com/PressSecKay,https://twitter.com/PressSecKay,https://www.sidneypowell.com/,https://youtu.be/SFCXPw1t17o?t=428,https://www.newsweek.com/sidney-powell-kraken-1548107,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html","Did Kayleigh McEnany Tweet, ‘Retweet If We Should Release the Kraken’?",,,,,,

The post misrepresents recommendations that a working group, which includes a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, put forth in a July report.   Fact Check: The image appears to show the headline of an article published on political commentator Alex Jones’ website InfoWars. The headline reads, “Joe Biden’s Covid-19 Taskforce Member Recommends Withholding Food Stamps, Rent Assistance From Those Who Refuse Vaccines.” The article claims Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, proposed that welfare benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and housing assistance should be withheld from anyone who refuses a coronavirus vaccination. There is, however, no evidence that Borio or any other member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, has suggested such a thing.  Borio, along with other medical experts, worked on a report published in July titled, “The Public’s Role in COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social, Behavioral, and Communication Sciences.” Check Your Fact reviewed the report in its entirety and found no mention of withholding of social services from people that refuse COVID-19 vaccinations. Rather, the report mentions exploring the idea of combining social welfare programs and vaccination programs to make a COVID-19 vaccination more accessible to already at-risk populations. “Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision,” the report states. (RELATED: Did Anthony Fauci Resign From The White House Coronavirus Task Force On July 13?) Monica Schoch-Spana and Emily Brunson, the lead authors of the report, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the headline shown in the Instagram post misrepresents the study, saying: “We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated.” “We recommend that one option to make vaccination more accessible, particularly to poor groups, is to provide vaccination at places where these individuals already go such as WIC clinics and food banks,” the authors explained in the emailed statement. “We support the provision of vaccinations alongside other services and goods that can help reduce the myriad burdens that the pandemic has placed upon individuals such as lost jobs, interrupted income, food insecurity, evictions, and foreclosures. We do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Jim Bronskill, the journalist whose name appears in the byline of the purported article, confirmed to Check Your Fact that “the story is a fabrication.”   Fact Check: The image shows an alleged screen grab of a Nov. 3 article, titled “Trudeau promises military intervention if Trump refuses to leave office,” that’s credited to Bronskill, a Canadian Press reporter. The supposed article, formatted similarly to those published by the Canadian news service CBC, alleges Trudeau “issued a dire warning at an impromptu press conference in Ottawa” that included “promising immediate military intervention on American soil if Donald Trump refuses to leave office after the US presidential election today.” While the article appears to be authentic at first glance, it is not. Searching on the CBC and Canadian Press websites respectively returned zero matches for the headline. Bronskill also confirmed in a LinkedIn direct message to Check Your Fact that “the story is a fabrication.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Paris Church Bells Ringing To Celebrate Joe Biden’s Election?)  Trudeau’s public schedule shows that he did hold a press conference on Nov. 3 in Ottawa around 11:30 a.m. local time. The prime minister did not mention election-related military intervention in the U.S. at any point in the press conference, a review of the press conference footage by Check Your Fact found. While Trudeau previously said that he wouldn’t weigh in on the results of the U.S. election until they were “sufficiently clear,” according to a Nov. 6 CBC report, he did release a statement Nov. 7 congratulating President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their projected victory. In the statement, Trudeau said he looks forward to “working with President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, their administration, and the United States Congress as we tackle the world’s greatest challenges together.” The Associated Press called the 2020 presidential race for Biden on Nov. 7, after they declared him the projected winner of Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley DevlinGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Bradley on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/david.shaw.94009/posts/10223176147248579,https://www.facebook.com/david.shaw.94009/posts/10223176147248579,https://twitter.com/JimBronskill?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.cbc.ca/,https://www.facebook.com/david.shaw.94009/posts/10223176147248579,https://www.cbc.ca/search?q=Trudeau%20promises%20military%20intervention%20if%20Trump%20refuses%20to%20leave%20office&section=all&sortOrder=relevance&media=all,https://www.thecanadianpress.com/?s=Trudeau+promises+military+intervention+if+Trump+refuses+to+leave+office.,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/10/fact-check-paris-church-bells-celebrate-joe-biden-election/,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/itineraries/2020/11/03/prime-ministers-itinerary-tuesday-november-3-2020,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUQnQ4wLhyU,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-canadian-reaction-us-election-results-2020-1.5792402,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2020/11/07/statement-prime-minister-canada-result-us-presidential-election,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2020/11/07/statement-prime-minister-canada-result-us-presidential-election,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://twitter.com/bradleydevlin",Image Claims To Show An Article Reporting Justin Trudeau ‘Promises Military Intervention If Trump Refuses To Leave Office’,,,,,,

Verdict: False The U.S. Army, Dominion Voting Systems and Scytl have refuted the claim that servers were seized in a raid by the Army in Germany.   Fact Check: The Nov. 15 Facebook post reads, “And now for some exciting news: The U.S. Army has seized servers for Dominion in Germany. Grab your popcorn.” The claim appears to originate from a tweet former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos sent that says Republican Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert “has stated that The U.S. Army has seized servers for Dominion in Germany.” Papadopoulos seems to have misquoted Gohmert, who, according to the Dallas Morning News, suggested during a recent Newsmax interview that the Spanish election software company Scytl – not Dominion Voting Systems – had been raided by the Army in Frankfurt. There is, however, no evidence such a raid took place. The U.S. Army has not put out a press release announcing the seizure of Dominion Voting Systems or Scytl servers in Germany. Scytl, the Army and Dominion Voting Systems have refuted the allegation.  In an article titled “Fact Checking Regarding US Elections: Debunking Fake News” on the company’s website, Scytl stated that “the US army has not seized anything from Scytl in Barcelona, Frankfurt or anywhere else” and that “technologies implemented by Scytl in the US are both hosted and managed within the US, by a local subsidiary, SOE Software, based in Tampa, Florida.” It also said the company does not “have servers or offices in Frankfurt” or “tabulate, tally or count votes in the US.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Army confirmed in an email that it “did not conduct any sort of raid in Germany nor did we acquire any servers with election data.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Over 500,000 Votes Switched From Trump To Biden) Dominion Voting Systems, which says it has customers in 28 states, and Scytl have also denied they have any affiliation with each other. Dominion states on its website that it has “no company ownership relationships with any members of the Pelosi family, the Feinstein family, or the Clinton Global Initiative, Smartmatic, Scytl, or any ties to Venezuela,” while Scytl says on its website that it is “not tied to Smartmatic, SGO, Dominion or Indra.” “We can confirm that no raid happened and that we don’t have any company data or servers in Germany,” Kay Stimson, the vice president of Government Affairs for Dominion Voting Systems, told Check Your Fact in an email. The Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council issued a joint Nov. 12 statement that said “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” Election officials in dozens of states also told The New York Times that there is no evidence “fraud or other irregularities” affected the outcome of the presidential election.

Verdict: False The photo shows the “March for Our Lives” rally that took place in D.C. in 2018.   Fact Check: The image shows a large, tightly-packed crowd extending down Pennsylvania Avenue in the nation’s capital. The accompanying caption in the Nov. 14 Facebook post attempts to link the photo to the “Million MAGA March,” saying it shows “the DC march today for Potus.” Supporters of President Donald Trump gathered in D.C. on Nov. 14 to protest supposed voter fraud, according to USA Today. The event, referred to on social media as the “Million MAGA March,” occurred a week after The Associated Press and other media outlets on Nov. 7 projected former Vice President Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election.  In reality, the photo being shared does not show the crowd at the “Million MAGA March.” Photographer Alex Brandon took the picture for The Associated Press at the “March for Our Lives” rally in March 2018, according to the original caption. It appeared in a Business Insider article that year about the D.C. march and similar rallies across the U.S. (RELATED: ‘Take The Guns First. Go Through Due Process Second’ — Did Kamala Harris Say This Quote?) An estimated 200,000 people attended the “March for Our Lives” rally in Washington, D.C., per CBS News. That march and others across the U.S. came after the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida that left 17 dead.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/SupportThePoliceNotCriminals/posts/2643035236009487,https://www.facebook.com/SupportThePoliceNotCriminals/posts/2643035236009487,https://www.google.com/maps/@38.89191,-77.0165916,3a,75y,285.91h,91.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sH9QfSiTSyMRdtjFpEs2gww!2e0!7i16384!8i8192,https://www.facebook.com/SupportThePoliceNotCriminals/posts/2643035236009487,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/14/trump-rally-washington-dc-million-maga-march-updates/6283411002/,https://apnews.com/article/why-did-AP-call-election-for-Biden-fe79276cd9175fffc7cf4fb58045fcf9,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-11-07-trump-biden-election-results-n1246882,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics/biden-election.html,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-biden-election-results-11-07-20/index.html,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/APTOPIX-Student-Gun-Protests/94f29c5602d147818924cee9b55cfa1d/1/0,https://www.businessinsider.com/march-for-our-lives-protestors-call-for-end-to-gun-violence-2018-3#following-the-shooting-on-saturday-tens-of-thousands-of-students-parents-teachers-and-others-supporting-gun-control-filled-the-streets-in-washington-dc-2,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/09/18/fact-check-take-guns-due-process-kamala-harris-quote/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-estimated-200000-people-attended-d-c-march/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/us/parkland-shooting-marjory-stoneman-douglas-2-years/index.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1b5b3a4b7aeb381a2a9a4a2aab8aeb4b3a7a0a2b5efa2aeac","No, This Photo Does Not Show The ‘Million MAGA March’ In DC",,,,,,

Verdict: False The image shows a scene from the 2016 NBA Championship victory parade in Cleveland, Ohio, not the recent pro-Trump rally in Washington.   Fact Check: People gathered in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 14 to march and protest in support of President Donald Trump’s reelection bid, despite former Vice President Biden being the projected winner of the presidential election, according to USA Today. The event, which was promoted on social media as the “Million MAGA March,” drew thousands of people, according to the Associated Press. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Paris Church Bells Ringing To Celebrate Joe Biden’s Election?) In the days following the “Million MAGA March,” multiple Facebook users shared a photo they claimed shows a large crowd at the Washington event. The caption for this particular Nov. 14 post reads, “D.C. Today!! Million MAGA March… and Biden had the most votes in history?? A man who didn’t campaign to but 50 people and stayed in the basement… No that doesn’t sound suspicious at all. This picture right here is why there needs to be a total legitimate recount! The truth is soon to shine America!”  However, the image does not show a scene from the rally. A reverse image search reveals the photo actually depicts a crowd attending the Cleveland Cavaliers 2016 NBA Championship victory parade in Ohio. The verified Cleveland Cavaliers Twitter account shared the photo in June 2016 with a caption that reads, “An estimated 1.3 million people enjoying #OneForTheLand. We love you, Cleveland.”  An estimated 1.3 million people enjoying #OneForTheLand.

The image appears to show a crowd gathered near the intersection of East 9th Street and Lakeside Avenue East, with the Cleveland Public Auditorium and the Huntington Convention Center visible in the background.

Kelly Loeffler on Parler saying, “Under the watch of Secretary Raffensperger, Stacey Abrams registered hundreds of thousands of black and Democrat voters.”  Verdict: False There is no record of Loeffler sending the message from her Parler account @KLoeffler. The pictured account does not belong to Loeffler, a spokesperson for her campaign confirmed.   Fact Check: The image appears to show a message Loeffler recently posted on the social media platform Parler. The message reads, “Here are the #FACTS: Under the watch of Secretary Raffensperger, Stacey Abrams registered hundreds of thousands of black and Democrat voters. We can’t let that happen again.” However, a closer inspection of the account reveals that the message doesn’t actually come from Loeffler. The Georgia senator has promoted her Parler account on her verified Facebook and Twitter accounts. Her handle on the platform is @KLoeffler rather than @SenatorKellyLoeffler. Loeffler’s Parler account shows no record of the pictured statement.  Stephen Lawson, the communications director for Loeffler’s campaign, told Check Your Fact in an email that the account @SenatorKellyLoeffler is “not her account.” The fake account is currently set to private. (RELATED: ‘George Soros Is Majority Owner Of New Social Media Platform Parler’ – Did Fox News Air This News Chyron?) The screen grab of the message from the fake account circulated online after Abrams, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, received praise for her efforts to register and mobilize voters in Georgia to flip the state to the Democrats. The Georgia Secretary of State website shows President-elect Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by about 14,000 votes as of Nov. 16, and multiple media outlets have called the presidential race in Georgia for Biden. Loeffler advanced to a January runoff election for the Senate on Nov. 3, according to The Associated Press.

Verdict: False Archived versions of the president’s Facebook page show that no change was made to his title. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the company did not alter the president’s designation.   Fact Check: In recent weeks, social media has become replete with erroneous claims related to the 2020 presidential election. This particular Facebook post claims that Facebook stripped President Donald Trump of the title “president” on his Facebook page following President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over him. “This is disturbing,” reads the post. “Facebook removed the title of ‘President’ from Donald Trump and designated him as ‘Political Candidate.’ Trump is still president and, no matter what happens, will remain so until Inauguration Day.” (RELATED: Did Cambridge Analytica ‘Hack’ Facebook?)  While Trump’s Facebook page does label him as a “Political Candidate,” it appears this has been the case for some time. Archived screen grabs of Trump’s Facebook page from October 2019, April 2020 and May 2020 show Trump labeled as a political candidate. A screen grab from Nov. 2 shows Trump labeled as both a political candidate and a politician. Previously, Trump’s Facebook page has described him simply as a “public figure.” Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the people who run the page choose the designation and that Facebook did not make any changes to Trump’s page following the election. “As you can see in these links from the Wayback Machine, the ‘political candidate’ designation — which is chosen by the Page admins — has been on the Page for months,” Stone said. Other political leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have the designation on their respective Facebook pages set to “politician.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False There is no evidence 500,000 votes switched from Trump to Biden, according to election officials, a national election security coalition and Dominion Voting Systems.   Fact Check: The Associated Press and other media outlets projected Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 7. (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) In the days following Biden’s projected victory, social media posts have alleged a large number of votes switched from Trump to the former vice president. This particular post reads, “Caught! Election data analyzed, producing detailed lists of over 500,000 votes SWITCHED from Trump to Biden via voting machine software theft, with heavy fraud focused on swing states.”  The claim may stem from a report from One America News Network’s Lilia Fifield, who, per Mediaite, alleged during a segment that “according to an unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research, states using Dominion Voting Systems may have switched as many as 435,000 votes from President Trump to Joe Biden.” Trump elevated the inaccurate claim on Twitter. Edison Research is a firm that provides exit-polling data to several news outlets such as CBS News and CNN. Larry Rosin, the firm’s president, told Check Your Fact in an email: “We never created any report and we have no evidence of voter fraud.” He also noted that the One America News Network story is no longer available on the outlet’s website. “Dominion Voting Systems categorically denies false assertions about vote switching issues without voting systems,” Dominion Voting Systems says on its website. “Voting deletion/switching assertions are completely false.” Though a small number of counties in Georgia and Michigan using Dominion Voting technology experienced minor issues, they did not affect the accuracy of vote counts, according to The New York Times. In one Georgia county, an issue with Dominion software delayed the reporting of the vote count but did not affect its accuracy, the outlet reported. A “user human error” by Michigan’s Antrim County clerk – not Dominion Voting software – caused an early tally to incorrectly make it seem like Biden was winning by some 3,000 votes but was corrected, Michigan election officials said, per The Associated Press. Election officials in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia have said there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in their respective states. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Election Workers In Pennsylvania’s Delaware County Committing Voter Fraud?) “The Wisconsin Elections Commission has seen no evidence of problems with Dominion Voting systems or any other manufacturer’s voting systems in Wisconsin,” Reid Magney, the public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email. He also directed Check Your Fact to a Nov. 10 news release in which Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief election official, said, “At this time, no evidence has been provided that supports allegations of systemic or widespread election issues.” Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office, told Check Your Fact that “there is no evidence issues in Michigan were anything other than human error.” The Georgia Secretary of State’s Office has also said that there is no evidence of system issues with voting or the current vote tally, which shows Biden leading by some 14,000 votes, according to The Associated Press. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, on its website pushed back on the claim that a “bad actor” could “change election results without detection” due to “robust safeguards including canvassing and auditing procedures.” The agency released a joint Nov. 12 statement with election officials that said “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changes votes, or was in any way compromised.” Election officials in dozens of states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota, also told The New York Times that there is no evidence “fraud or other irregularities” affected the outcome of the presidential election.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While Ticketmaster has been developing plans to help venues verify whether individuals have tested negative for COVID-19 or been vaccinated against the disease, the company is not mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for attendees. Ticketmaster, which sells tickets for event organizers, said does not have the ability to mandate such a thing.   Fact Check: The image, which was originally shared on the Instagram page @informedmothers, says, “Ticketmaster is planning mandatory COVID vaccine identification for concert attendance. We told you it was coming and now it’s here. Young healthy people DO NOT need a vaccine for a virus with a 99% recovery rate and Ticketmaster is not your physician.” The claim that Ticketmaster will require COVID-19 vaccines for attendees started circulating after Billboard published a story titled “How Ticketmaster Plans to Check Your Vaccine Status for Concerts: Exclusive.” Billboard reported that Ticketmaster “has been working on a framework for post-pandemic fan safety that uses smart phones to verify fans’ vaccination status or whether they’ve tested negative for the coronavirus within a 24 to 72 hour window.” The plan, which has not been approved, would theoretically include health pass companies signaling to Ticketmaster whether a fan received verification to attend an event after the fan gave consent to send results to the health pass company, according to the Billboard report.  Ticketmaster provided clarification on the subject in a tweet on Friday, saying, “We know there’s been some incorrect information being reported around safety/entry requirements and want to ensure everyone has all the facts. To clarify, there is absolutely no requirement from Ticketmaster mandating vaccines/testing.” The tweet included a link to Ticketmaster’s webpage on the company’s COVID-19 screening requirements that also stated the company is “just exploring the ability to enhance our existing digital ticket capabilities to offer solutions for event organizers that could include testing and vaccine information with 3rd party health providers.” “Ticketmaster does not have the power to set policies around safety/entry requirements, which would include vaccines and/or testing protocols,” the webpage says. “That would always be up to the discretion of the event organizer, based on their preferences and local health guidelines.” (RELATED: Is The Cheesecake Factory Closing All Of Its Locations?) In a statement to WUSA9, Ticketmaster President Mark Yovich said, “We imagine there will be many third-party health care providers handling vetting – whether that is getting a vaccine, taking a test, or other methods of review and approval – which could then be linked via a digital ticket so everyone entering the event is verified. Ticketmaster’s goal is to provide enough flexibility and options that venues and fans have multiple paths to return to events, and is working to create integrations to our API and leading digital ticketing technology as we will look to tap into the top solutions based on what’s green-lit by officials and desired by clients.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley DevlinGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Bradley on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3597865743604356&set=a.473811596009802&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3597865743604356&set=a.473811596009802&type=3,https://archive.is/6Hxqd,https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan,https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan,https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9481166/ticketmaster-vaccine-check-concerts-plan,https://twitter.com/Ticketmaster/status/1327108369849544706,https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/What-are-your-COVID-screening-requirements?language=en_US,https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/What-are-your-COVID-screening-requirements?language=en_US,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/09/fact-check-cheesecake-factory-closing-all-locations/,https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/ticketmaster-covid-vaccine-requirement/65-a2cea9df-37cc-4460-a166-4e2e5b3a5de9,https://twitter.com/bradleydevlin",Viral Image Claims Ticketmaster Is Mandating COVID-19 Vaccinations For Attendees,,,,,,

(@real_streetpatriot)   Verdict: False Fox News did not run this chyron, according to a Fox News spokesperson. A spokesperson from the Open Society Foundations confirmed Soros has no ownership in Parler. Fact Check:   The Nov. 12 Instagram post attempts to link Parler, a social media platform similar to Twitter but with fewer rules, to billionaire George Soros. Parler has become a popular alternative among disgruntled Twitter users who felt as if the platform censored speech, according to The New York Times. The image appears to be a screen grab of a tweet showing a scene from a live Fox News broadcast featuring “America’s Newsroom” host Sandra Smith and Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts. Below them is a chyron that reads, “Fox News Confirms: George Soros Is Majority Owner Of New Social Platform Parler.” However, the chyron in the image appears to be digitally manipulated. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to suggest Fox News reported on such a connection between Soros and Parler. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed in a phone call with the DCNF that the network did not run the chyron shown in the post or report anything about Soros owning Parler.  The image of Smith and Roberts used in the Instagram post appears to be from a Nov. 10 episode of “America’s Newsroom.” At the moment when both are on the screen, the actual chyron reads, “Trump Campaign Files Lawsuit Alleging Two-Tiered Voting System in Pennsylvania.” There is no mention of Soros or Parler during the segment. Smith later addressed the fake image during a Nov. 13 episode of “America’s Newsroom,” saying, “A screen grab of this program was taken, edited and distributed to fit a completely false narrative. It was not real.” (RELATED: Does George Soros Own The Voting Technology Firm Smartmatic?) Parler CEO John Matze additionally confirmed that Soros does not own the social media platform. “The ownership structure of Parler is myself, a small group of close friends and employees,” wrote Matze on the website. In another post, Matze states, “George Soros has absolutely no association in any capacity with Parler.” A spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations, a Soros-founded organization that supports progressive causes around the world, told the DCNF in an email, “George Soros has absolutely no financial interest or ownership in Parler.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It appears to have originated as a joke from an entertainer who makes satirical videos.   Fact Check: Ingraham conducted an interview with an anonymous person during a Nov. 10 broadcast of her Fox News show “The Ingraham Angle.” The person, whose identity was masked by a silhouette and distorted audio, claimed to be a Nevada poll worker that allegedly witnessed “rampant voter fraud” occurring during the election. Social media users have been sharing an excerpt of the interview where the anonymous person’s voice seems to resemble that of Trump, with this particular Instagram post saying, “This is definitely Trump.”  “I’m not going to say which party does it but thousands of votes are gathered, and they come in, and then they’re dumped in a location, and then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you’re going to win,” the voice says in the clip. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Michigan ‘Magically Found’ Over 130,000 Votes Cast For Joe Biden) The altered video was created by Nick Lutsko, who is a musician and entertainer according to his Twitter profile. His Facebook page includes media content such as songs and satirical videos. Lutsko first shared the altered video on Twitter after Ingraham’s Nov. 10 show with the caption, “This is definitely Trump.” The tweet has garnered more than 31,000 retweets and 135,000 likes. The audio track used in the video appears to come from a White House press briefing from April 8. Trump made the remarks during that April press briefing, the White House transcript confirms, and cameras can be heard taking photographs in the background. The altered video was widely promoted on social media but some users did not appear to perceive its satirical nature. Jared Holt, a researcher at the Atlantic Council Digital Forensic Research Lab, said in a tweet that the video was intended to be comedic: “Nick is a very funny comedian and any self-serious person who shared this as if [it] was real should probably be on your unfollow list.” Unaltered excerpts of the interview have also been shared by social media users and the full interview can be viewed on Fox News’ website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsVarun HukeriGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Varun on Twitter","https://www.instagram.com/p/CHc4BdogKTL/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHc4BdogKTL/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nevada-voter-fraud-election-2020-ingraham-angle-exclusive,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHc4BdogKTL/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/05/fact-check-michigan-found-130000-votes-joe-biden/,https://twitter.com/NickLutsko,https://www.facebook.com/NickLutsko/,https://twitter.com/NickLutsko/status/1326375815572025344,https://www.c-span.org/video/?471047-1/president-trump-comments-senator-sanders-ending-presidential-campaign,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-22/,https://twitter.com/jaredlholt,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/digital-forensic-research-lab/,https://twitter.com/jaredlholt/status/1326393945769832450,https://twitter.com/danielchaitin7/status/1326373556050137089,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nevada-voter-fraud-election-2020-ingraham-angle-exclusive,https://www.twitter.com/varunhukeri",Does This Video Show Donald Trump Pretending To Be An Anonymous ‘Nevada Poll Worker’?,,,,,,

Fact Check: Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and the state’s Department of Health on Nov. 8 issued mandates in response to a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. The orders include wearing face coverings in public, at work and within 6-foot proximity of people outside of their households, as well as limiting “casual social gatherings” to household members only through Nov. 23, according to The Associated Press. Multiple Facebook users shared an image of an alleged Nov. 12 tweet Trump seemingly directed at Herbert in response to the governor’s actions. The supposed tweet reads: “Republican Governor’s (sic) should not be shutting down their states!!! Grow a pair and let people decide how much risk they accept!! We are Americans! Thanksgiving isnt (sic) cancelled!!! I am talking to you @garyherbert!!!”  There is, however, no record of Trump sending the tweet. It does not appear on his Twitter timelines or in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. A tweet to that effect likely would have prompted media coverage as well. (RELATED: Does Chapter 45 Of Donald Trump’s ‘The Art Of The Deal’ Tell Readers To ‘Never Admit Defeat’?) Herbert currently tweets from the verified Twitter handle @GovHerbert. The handle @garyherbert is not verified, has only nine followers, shows zero visible tweets and does not follow any verified politicians at the time of publication.

The article listed Wards 274, 273, 272, 277, 269, 234 and 312 as having more ballots cast than registered voters, seemingly suggesting voter fraud occurring in them.  However, the numbers are not accurate. Data from the Milwaukee County Clerk’s website shows that turnout did not exceed 100 percent in the seven wards. Here are the numbers of registered voters and, as of Nov. 4, the unofficial tally of votes counted for each of the seven wards, as reported by the Milwaukee County Clerk: Ward 274: 702 registered voters and 611 votes cast. Ward 273: 671 registered voters and 612 votes cast. Ward 272: 1,190 registered voters and 1,096 votes cast. Ward 277: 1,520 registered voters and 1,321 votes cast. Ward 269: 978 registered voters and 861 votes cast. Ward 234: 688 registered voters and 588 votes cast. Ward 312: 1,029 registered voters and 951 votes cast. The Wisconsin Elections Commission tweeted on Nov. 4 that the state had over 3.68 million active registered voters on Nov. 1, noting that “there are never more ballots than registered voters.” The state has same-day voter registration. Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, previously told Check Your Fact that the state’s unofficial estimate for voter turnout is about 72.6%. The Milwaukee City Wire article was later updated to reflect the numbers reported by the county clerk’s office. In total, unofficial data shows 460,300 ballots were cast for the 2020 election in Milwaukee County out of 550,132 registered voters.

View this post on Instagram                     Due to an overwhelming amount of messages and shares, I wanted to post @from_the_windowz_to_the_walz and I’s video showing proof of trashed ballots. This is our moral obligation as Christian’s and Americans to share! A post shared by  Chase O’Shea (@chaseoshea) on Nov 9, 2020 at 3:20pm PST    Verdict: False The video shows spoiled ballots upon which voters had mistakenly marked two candidates for the same race, according to the Oklahoma State Election Board. The spoiled ballots were disposed with the voter’s consent prior to being issued a new ballot.   Fact Check: The Instagram post claims it shows “proof of trashed ballots” and says it is the “moral obligation” of “Christian’s (sic) and Americans to share!” The video features two men going through a bag full of ballots allegedly discarded at St. Anne Church, identified by them as a polling place in Oklahoma for the Nov. 3 presidential election. The men in the video claim they stumbled upon the ballots when they were taking out the trash after attending a wedding at the church. However, the Oklahoma State Election Board debunked the video in a Twitter thread, identifying them as spoiled ballots “where the voter mistakenly marked more than one option in a race.” The pictured ballots are not evidence of election fraud.     FACT CHECK: This video is from pct 469 / subpct 457 in Tulsa County. These are clearly “spoiled ballots” where the voter mistakenly marked more than one option in a race. Spoiled ballots are returned to the precinct clerk and destroyed, then the voter is issued a new ballot. — Oklahoma State Election Board (@OKelections) November 9, 2020  The second tweet in the Oklahoma State Election Board’s thread features four images that provide evidence the ballots had been spoiled, including photos with circles indicating where they were incorrectly marked. It also shows a redacted Spoiled Ballot Affidavit signed by voters acknowledging that their ballots were spoiled and destroyed in their presence before receiving a new one.  FACT CHECK (PART 2): Here are screen shots from the video that clearly show the ballots have been spoiled. We also are posting a redacted Spoiled Ballot Affidavit signed by voters before their spoiled ballots were destroyed. pic.twitter.com/EnklPRN81l — Oklahoma State Election Board (@OKelections) November 9, 2020  The Oklahoma State Election Board also provided a link to the relevant state statute dictating how election officials handle spoiled ballots. The statute states:  “Should a voter spoil any ballot in an effort to vote the same, the voter shall fold the ballot and return it to the clerk. The clerk shall destroy the ballot in the presence of the voter and shall issue the voter another ballot in the same manner that the first one was provided. The voter must execute an affidavit prescribed by the Secretary of the State Election Board in which the voter swears or affirms that he or she spoiled the original ballot, returned the ballot to the clerk, that the clerk destroyed the ballot in the voter’s presence and that the voter was issued a new ballot.” In a separate thread, the Oklahoma State Election Board tweeted, “OK has checks and balances in place to detect & prevent voter fraud. OK election officials take allegations of fraud seriously & report credible allegations to the appropriate authorities for investigation. That video is NOT fraud.” (RELATED: There Have Been A  Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) The Associated Press called the presidential race in Oklahoma for Trump on Nov. 3.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley DevlinGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Bradley on Twitter","https://www.instagram.com/p/CHY19zygjJw/,https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHY19zygjJw/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.instagram.com/chaseoshea/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHY19zygjJw/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/St.+Anne+Catholic+Church/@36.0482424,-95.7826569,15.12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa74bca6310ca5bd6!8m2!3d36.0498868!4d-95.7790045,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHY19zygjJw/,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325909914590588929,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325909914590588929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325910239959425024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325910239959425024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/EnklPRN81l,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325910154907439104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325910239959425024?s=20,https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78569,https://twitter.com/OKelections/status/1325920632375308294?s=20,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/06/fact-check-election-fraud-voting/,https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1323792488814039046,https://twitter.com/bradleydevlin",Does This Video Show Ballots Cast For Trump Discarded In Oklahoma?,,,,,,

Fact Check: Social media has become replete with allegations of election fraud since the Nov. 3 presidential election, with many claims focusing on Georgia, a state where, according to The New York Times, President-elect Joe Biden had a roughly 14,000-vote lead over President Donald Trump at the time of publication. The Associated Press and other media outlets called the presidential race for Biden on Nov. 7. This particular Facebook post alleges that “132,000 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia have been identified which are likely ineligible.” The accompanying caption states that these alleged “likely ineligible” ballots are due to “change of address” red flags and that they are “enough to be a gamechanger” for Trump.  Fulton County includes Atlanta and is Georgia’s most populous county. Had 132,000 of the over 524,000 ballots cast in Fulton County for the presidential election been flagged as “likely ineligible,” it would have been picked up by national media outlets, yet none appear to have done so. In an emailed statement provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation, Fulton County Registration and Elections Board Director Richard Barron said that the claim about 132,000 ballots being flagged is “simply false.” “Fulton County is aware of allegations of 132,000 ballots being ‘flagged,'” the statement reads. “These claims are simply false and baseless. Certain news organizations have circulated this information without contacting Fulton County for confirmation.” (RELATED: Did Georgia’s DeKalb County Reject 40,000 Mail-In Ballots?) The inaccurate claim appears to have been highlighted by the Twitter account @Peoples_Pundit, which posted screen grabs of what it claimed showed Georgia voter data that depicted 132,000 people in Fulton County being flagged as “Change of  Address.” However, Fulton County election officials told The Associated Press that the photos do not show an official election database. Of the over 524,000 votes were cast in Fulton County as of Nov. 10, about 73 percent were in favor of Biden and 26 percent were for Trump, according to unofficial election results found on the county’s official website. Georgia’s secretary of state said Wednesday that they would conduct a by-hand recount of the state’s roughly 5 million votes cast for president, the Wall Street Journal reported. The George Secretary of State’s Office has said there is no evidence of systemic voting problems, per The Associated Press. Georgia removed over 300,000 inactive voters — including 45,000 in Fulton County — from its list last year, according to local outlet WABE.

Verdict: False The video shows deputies recovering Amazon packages, not discarded ballots, according to the Boone County Sheriff’s Office.   Fact Check: The video appears to have originated on TikTok, where the user @kuntefason posted it without a caption on Nov. 7. It appears to show law enforcement officers moving several bags on the side of the road in Hebron, Kentucky. The town’s Waffle House appears in the background of the video. “#Breaking #BreakingNews Police find THOUSANDS of Ballots for #Trump thrown in a field,” one Facebook user captioned the video. “But the CRIMINAL #MainstreamMedia? They LIE through their FACES that there is no #VoterFraud at all anywhere after LYING& Calling races to discourage voters from voting trying to get them to go home.”  The Boone County Sheriff’s Office, which has jurisdiction over Hebron, called the claim that the video shows officers collecting discarded ballots “false” in a Nov. 9 statement. (RELATED: Did Virginia Election Workers Take Ballots Home On Election Night?) “On November 7, 2020 we were notified that discarded packages had been found off of North Bend Road in Hebron,” the statement reads. “It was reported that several large bags filled with what appeared to be Amazon packages were located and were torn and/or had been opened. Our deputies responded to the area and removed five (5) large bags from the woods.” The sheriff’s deputies “examined the contents of the bags and confirmed that they contained Amazon packages which had been opened,” according to the statement. An Amazon representative also confirmed the packages came from a nearby Amazon facility and returned them there. A spokesperson for the Boone County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that no ballots were discovered.

Verdict: False The Freedom Bell rings every day at noon. A spokesperson for the District Office of Tempelhof-Schöneberg confirmed that the bell was not rung in celebration.   Fact Check: The Nov. 8 Facebook post shares a video showing nearby buildings at night, purportedly in Berlin, while a bell can be heard ringing in the distance. “Philadelphia gifted Germany the Freedom Bell in 1950, which is rung once a year every Xmas,” the video’s caption states. “In an out of sequence show of acknowledgement of the dawn of a new era, Berlin rang them last night on Biden’s claim to the White House in the 2020 elections.” The Freedom Bell was a gift from Americans that was installed in Berlin’s Rathaus Schöneberg town hall in 1950, according to the city’s government. The bell rings daily at noon, per the Visit Berlin website.  After The Associated Press and other major news outlets projected Biden as the winner of the presidential election on Nov. 7, there were small celebrations in Berlin, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave her congratulations and well wishes to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, the Berlin Spectator reported. However, there have been no reports of the Freedom Bell being rung in excitement of the news. Barbara Feller, a spokesperson for the District Office of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, confirmed that the bell was not rung in celebration. (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot Of Allegations Of Election Fraud, We Looked Into Them) “The property management of the Schöneberg City Hall informs that the Berlin Freedom Bell DID NOT ring separately on the occasion of Joe Biden’s election victory,” Feller told Check Your Fact in an email. “The bell rings every day at 12 noon.

A post shared by  Sandra Bernhard (@sandragbernhard) on Nov 8, 2020 at 12:43pm PST    Verdict: False This is not a genuine New York Post cover. The cover from the Nov. 4 issue features a woman biting her nails with the headline, “NAILBITER.”   Fact Check: An image on Instagram depicts what appears to be the cover of the Nov. 4 “Future Edition” of the New York Post declaring President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Featured on the cover is an image of Trump walking in a suit with his tie undone and grasping a red cap. Trump’s signature phrase during his time as host of the reality TV show “The Apprentice,” “you’re fired,” is in bold letters in the center of the cover, right below a quote reading, “My fellow Americans, our long NATIONAL NIGHTMARE is over.” But the New York Post never ran such a cover. A list of covers published by the outlet shows no instance of the purported cover ever being run. The Nov. 4 cover actually features an image of a woman biting her nails along with the headline, “NAILBITER.” This cover also includes a weather forecast next to the date instead of the words, “Future Edition” which can be found on the alleged cover in the Instagram post. (RELATED: Did Virginia Election Workers Take Ballots Home On Election Night?)  Major news outlets including Fox News, The Associated Press and CBS News projected on Nov. 7 Biden to be the winner of the election, three days after the purported New York Post cover was released. The New York Post did not publish a cover projecting a winner of the 2020 presidential election until Nov. 8. That cover featured an image of Biden along with the text, “After 144 million votes, five days of counting and squeaker wins in Rust Belt states, America finally gives her verdict… IT’S JOE TIME.” The fake cover went viral on Twitter after political consultant Mike Murphy shared the image along with the tweet, “New orders from Rupert, bury him.” Other individuals, such as journalist Katie Couric and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, likewise shared the image as if it was real, according to Mediaite.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The quote appears to be fabricated.   Fact Check: The alleged excerpt from chapter 45 of Trump’s 1987 book “The Art of the Deal” has circulated widely amid the Trump campaign’s efforts to fight the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Associated Press and other national media outlets called the election for former Vice President Joe Biden on Nov. 7. The full quote, purportedly appearing in “The Art of the Deal,” reads:  Never admit defeat. You win. If you don’t win, claim they cheated. They rigged it. They stole it. You are the aggrieved but you are the true winner always. Threaten to sue and/or die. No one will remember the outcome. Just that you fought to defend your honor. This is essential to keep your brand healthy and keep the millions of chumps and losers, your base. There is, however, no record of the excerpt in “The Art of the Deal.” A search for phrases such as “never admit defeat” and “true winner always” turned up no matches for the alleged passage. The book’s table of contents shows that it only has 14 chapters, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. The “millions of chumps and losers” line suggests that the passage may have been fabricated to poke fun at Trump and his supporters. (RELATED: Did Trump Say, ‘Being An Atheist Gives Me An Edge In Every Deal’?) While there is no evidence Trump wrote the passage in the Facebook post, he did state in “The Art of the Deal” that he would “do nearly anything within legal bounds to win.” He also discussed defeat in his 2007 book “Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life.” “I had friends who chose to give up on themselves and declare their own defeat,” he wrote. “What a stupid thing to do! Of course, they never made it through. Never declare yourself beaten. If you fail at something, it is okay. That may be out of your control, but never voluntarily throw in the towel. Always keep fighting!” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False The video shows a prank created for TikTok, not an instance of election fraud.   Fact Check: The video, which was originally posted on TikTok by the user @bigchoppadoe, shows a man in a yellow vest sorting through papers. In the video, he portrays himself as a poll worker and rips ups what looks like a ballot marked for Trump, saying, “If some of these votes happen to say, like this one, Donald J. Dumb Trump, that one just don’t make it.” Multiple Facebook users shared a reposting of the video, with one user commenting, “This prick needs to go to jail!! He’s a poll worker and the video shows him ripping up Ballots that are for Trump!” It has also circulated on Twitter.  Despite many social media users claiming it is evidence of election fraud, the TikTok video does not actually show such a crime. Dale Harrison, who Heavy identified as the man behind the account @bigchoppadoe, created the short video as a joke, according to a Nov. 9 message he posted on Facebook. His TikTok account is currently private. “Sooo I did this video in my Amazon outfit cause y’all know I’m always joking! And it’s getting crazyyyy views!” he wrote, in part. (RELATED: Did An Arizona State Trooper Find 50,000 Ballots Cast For Donald Trump In A Dumpster?) He also responded to a separate Facebook comment asking if he really destroyed ballots, saying, “It’s a joke. I’ve never worked for them,” according to Heavy.

Verdict: False Archives of the RCP website show that it never called Biden as winning Pennsylvania. RCP’s president has confirmed the claim is inaccurate.   Fact Check: The vote tallies of some states are still too close to call a winner as ballots continue to be counted, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The Associated Press, along with other media outlets, announced Nov. 7 that even without the undecided states, Biden had won more than the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. A post shared on Facebook features a screen grabbed tweet claiming RCP rescinded its call for Biden winning Pennsylvania and its 20 Electoral College votes, putting him 11 votes below the 270 needed. “Just in case you were wondering, RCP has thrown PA into the undecided column today so as of tonight Joe Biden has 259 EVs,” the Nov. 9 tweet reads. “Or as some would like to say, NOT President Elect.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Paris Church Bells Ringing To Celebrate Joe Biden’s Election?)  But RCP never showed a winner for Pennsylvania. Check Your Fact searched the Wayback Machine, an internet archive, between Nov. 3 and Nov. 10, but found no instances of RCP listing Biden as Pennsylvania’s winner. RCP’s electoral map showed Pennsylvania as undecided and Biden as having 259 votes on Nov. 7, the day Biden was announced as the president-elect. As of press time, RCP’s map shows the same results. Several individuals, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, tweeted the false claim that Biden was no longer the president-elect. Spicer later tweeted a correction. RCP’s co-founder and president, Tom Bevan, responded to these claims in a Nov. 10 tweet.  This is false. We never called Pennsylvania, and nothing has changed. https://t.co/YXZ1PjI7Ud — Tom Bevan (@TomBevanRCP) November 10, 2020  “This is false,” Bevan tweeted. “We never called Pennsylvania, and nothing has changed.” Senior elections analyst for RCP, Sean Trende, likewise said that the claim was “untrue” on Twitter. While The Associated Press and cable news networks have projected Biden as the winner, RCP has not called the 2020 presidential race for either candidate at the time of publication. RCP lists Biden as having 259 electoral votes and President Donald Trump as having 214 on its interactive map as of press time.

Verdict: False  There is no evidence of 50,000 ballots cast for Trump being found in an Arizona dumpster. The Arizona Department of Public Safety confirmed that the claim is false.    Fact Check:  In the week following the 2020 presidential election, allegations of voter fraud have been circulating on social media platforms. This particular Facebook post claims that in Arizona, a state trooper found 50,000 ballots cast for Trump in a dumpster “because they know they can’t win being honest and casting their votes!” There is, however, no evidence such an incident has occurred. Had 50,000 discarded ballots been found by state police, there would likely be media coverage on it, but local news outlets such as AZ Central, The Arizona Daily Star and The Yuma Sun have not reported about such a discovery.  Raul Garcia, a public information officer for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the rumor is false, saying, “We are aware of the information being spread and we can tell you it is not true.” (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Ballots Cast For Donald Trump Shredded By A Poll Worker In Pensacola, Florida) The claim may have originated from reports of 18 unopened mail-in ballots found on the side of a road in Glendale, Arizona, in late October. The ballots, which were still sealed, were returned to the registered voters by Glendale police officers and agents from the Attorney General’s office before the election, per AZ Family. The election in the battleground state of Arizona remains too close to call, with President-elect Joe Biden holding a slight lead over Trump, The New York Times reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsEthan EversContributor","https://www.facebook.com/2016PresidentialElectionMakeAmericaGreatAgain/photos/a.1017626398345465/3375194999255248/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/2016PresidentialElectionMakeAmericaGreatAgain/photos/a.1017626398345465/3375194999255248/?type=3&theater,https://www.google.com/search?q=50000+ballots+in+arizona+dumpster&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&oq=50000+ballots+in+arizona+dumpster&aqs=chrome..69i57.6934j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.azcentral.com/search/?q=ballots+in+dumpster,https://tucson.com/search/?sd=desc&l=25&s=start_time&f=html&t=article%2Cvideo%2Cyoutube%2Ccollection&app=editorial&nsa=eedition&q=ballots+in+dumpster,https://www.yumasun.com/search/?sd=desc&l=25&s=start_time&nfl=ap&f=html&t=article%2Cvideo%2Cyoutube%2Ccollection%2Cimage%2Cpdf&app=editorial&nsa=eedition&q=ballots+in+dumpster,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/05/fact-check-image-shredded-ballots-donald-trump-pensacola-florida/,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stolen-ballots-arizona-election-day-glendale-police-farm-worker-vote,https://www.azfamily.com/news/18-stolen-ballots-found-on-side-of-road-in-glendale/article_c1558b16-1e19-11eb-af16-0fa6a167e28a.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/09/us/arizona-election-battleground-state-counties.html","Did An Arizona State Trooper Find 50,000 Ballots Cast For Donald Trump In A Dumpster?",,,,,,

Verdict: False The bells appear to be automatically-programmed calls to evening Mass. They had nothing to do with Biden’s election, according to a statement from the Diocese of Nanterre.   Fact Check: The video shows a night-time panorama of the Parisian skyline in which numerous bells throughout the city can be heard ringing. The caption reads, “Church Bells Ringing Across my beloved Paris in Celebration of the new President of the United States, Joe Biden!” The Associated Press called the 2020 presidential election for the former vice president on Nov. 7 after the outlet declared him the winner in Pennsylvania. While people did take to the streets to celebrate, the video does not show Paris church bells ringing in celebration of Biden’s election. (RELATED: Does This Video Show French Police Throwing Handcuffs On The Ground To Protest Coronavirus Restrictions?)  Rather, they appear to have been automatic bells calling the faithful to prayer, according to a statement from the Diocese of Nanterre, a Paris suburb. The statement, roughly translated, indicates that some churches’ bells in that diocese are “automatically programmed” to ring every Saturday around 5:45 p.m. local time for evening Mass, despite most religious services being recently banned by the French government as part of coronavirus mitigation measures. “This is the case of the bells of the Notre-Dame de l’Assomption church in Meudon, which can be seen and heard in a video shared on social networks by a resident of the city,” the statement says. “Other reasons have been mentioned by some, but the diocese of Nanterre confirms with this message the exact reason for this flight of bells.” When reached for comment, the Diocese of Paris directed the Daily Caller News Foundation to the statement from the Diocese of Nanterre. France 24 previously debunked the claim, tweeting, “We also verified with the @dioceseparis, no instructions were given to ring bells for #Elections2020 or for a tribute following the #Nice attack.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Washington Times confirmed it never published the headline shown in the image.   Fact Check: The image of the alleged “Election Special” front page from The Washington Times has circulated widely on social media in recent days.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for President Donald Trump’s campaign, tweeted a photo of the supposed newspaper front page on Nov. 8, saying, “Greeting staff at @TeamTrump HQ this morning, a reminder the media doesn’t select the President.” In the alleged front page, the newspaper puts up the headline “President Gore” and shows a photo of the then-Democratic presidential candidate.  In response to Murtaugh’s now-deleted tweet, The Washington Times on Twitter debunked the notion that it ran such a headline, noting that the image is doctored.  Those photos have been doctored. The Washington Times never ran a “President Gore” headline. — The Washington Times (@WashTimes) November 8, 2020  “Those photos have been doctored,” the newspaper tweeted. “The Washington Times never ran a ‘President Gore’ headline.” Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the doctored front page has been circulating online since at least 2010, when it was posted on a DeviantArt blog. The Mitchell Archives, a comprehensive database of newspapers, appears to show the actual Nov. 8, 2000 front page of The Washington Times with the headline “President Bush” and a photo of then-Republican candidate George W. Bush. Al Gore lost to Bush in the 2000 presidential election after a legal battle in which the Supreme Court resolved the contest in Bush’s favor, according to Reuters.

Verdict: False While Trump did hold four rallies on Oct. 31, the photo actually shows Trump waiting for U.S. detainees from North Korea in 2018.   Fact Check: The Nov. 2 Facebook post features a photo of Trump sitting next to a window, allegedly waiting for the arrival of three hostages rescued from Nigeria on Oct. 31. “This man did 4 rallies on Saturday,” the image’s caption reads. “He is 74. Did he go to bed afterwards? No. After being up for 20 hrs, this is a photo of him waiting at the airport until 2am to welcome home 3 American hostages whom our Navy Seals just rescued in Nigeria.” Navy SEALs rescued U.S. citizen Philipe Walton early Oct. 31 from a group of armed captors in northern Nigeria, ABC News reported. Walton had been kidnapped from his farm in the neighboring country of Niger a few days prior on Oct. 27, according to The Associated Press.  Trump did hold four campaign rallies in Pennsylvania the day of the rescue mission, per The New York Times. The image, however, was actually taken more than two years ago while Trump waited for three U.S. detainees in North Korea to arrive in the U.S. as part of a “gesture of goodwill” from the country, the Washington Post reported. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo on the stock photo website Alamy, with the caption: “U.S. President Donald Trump aboard Marine One after landing at Joint Base Andrews to welcome home three American detainees May 10, 2018 in Clinton, Maryland. Three detainees were released include Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the planned meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.” Trump shared a video of the reunion on Twitter the same day. Check Your Fact found no media reports of Trump meeting Walton in the U.S. after he was rescued. In fact, The Associated Press reported that following the rescue mission in Nigeria, Walton returned to his home in Niger, not the U.S. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet That He Had ‘The Most Coronavirus’? ) Trump celebrated Walton’s rescue on Twitter the day it occurred. “Last night, our Country’s brave warriors rescued an American hostage in Nigeria,” the tweet reads. “Our Nation salutes the courageous soldiers behind the daring nighttime rescue operation and celebrates the safe return of yet another American citizen!”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/pressley.stutts/posts/3556481007728587,https://www.facebook.com/pressley.stutts/posts/3556481007728587,https://abcnews.go.com/International/american-hostage-philip-walton-rescued-dramatic-military-operation/story?id=73940195,https://apnews.com/article/kidnapping-africa-west-africa-nigeria-niger-d2578bfe74dbff88d16475d03a0281f1,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/31/us/trump-biden-election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-pence-offer-heros-welcome-to-three-americans-freed-by-north-korea-as-plane-lands-outside-washington/2018/05/10/f1076fd2-53cd-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html,https://www.alamy.com/joint-base-andrews-may-10-2018-us-president-donald-trump-aboard-marine-one-after-landing-at-joint-base-andrews-to-welcome-home-three-american-detainees-may-10-2018-in-clinton-maryland-three-detainees-were-released-include-kim-dong-chul-tony-kim-and-kim-hak-song-as-a-gesture-of-goodwill-ahead-of-the-planned-meeting-between-trump-and-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-credit-planetpixalamy-live-news-image184568374.html?mid=41152&siteID=MRu_ISar6sQ-_SdY_bmup23RH_B0KxczWw&utm_source=LS&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=US,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994517833357946882,https://www.google.com/search?q=Trump+meets+Philip+Walton&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjXtoyXk_bsAhXeknIEHcLQChwQ_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1920&bih=896,https://apnews.com/article/kidnapping-africa-west-africa-nigeria-niger-d2578bfe74dbff88d16475d03a0281f1,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/26/fact-check-donald-trump-tweet-most-coronavirus/,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1322568272483475457,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1322568272483475457,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89fdfbecffe6fbc9eae1eceae2f0e6fcfbefe8eafda7eae6e4",Image Claims To Show Donald Trump Waiting To Welcome U.S. Hostages After Holding 4 Campaign Rallies,,,,,,

A spokesperson for the company confirmed the rumor is false.   Fact Check: The coronavirus pandemic has impacted the food service industry, resulting in a loss of nearly $120 billion by June and an expected loss of $240 billion by the end of the year, Forbes reported. At least 100,000 restaurants have closed since the start of the pandemic, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association. A post on Facebook alleges the popular chain restaurant The Cheesecake Factory is closing all of its locations. There is, however, no evidence the restaurant chain has plans to do such a thing. If the company announced it would be closing all of its Cheesecake Factory locations, it would have garnered media attention, but no news reporting could be found corroborating the claim. (RELATED: Is Dunkin’ Donuts Closing All Locations Over Coronavirus Concerns?)  “There is absolutely no truth to this,” said Gabrielle Gaines, a spokesperson for The Cheesecake Factory, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Cheesecake Factory is not planning to close any locations.” The rumor may have originated from an announcement that The Cheesecake Factory Inc. will be closing its RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant owned by the company, at the end of the year. There is no indication that the company plans to close all its Cheesecake Factory locations. Rather, the company has reportedly opened approximately 90% of their restaurants, including 187 Cheesecake Factory locations, for indoor dining in a limited capacity in accordance with local mandates and social distancing protocols, according to The Associated Press.

ProPublica’s archive of deleted tweets confirms she did not delete five days’ worth of tweets.   Fact Check: A Nov. 6 post on Facebook features a screen grab of a now-deleted tweet claiming McEnany has “already begun packing up” to leave the White House. The Associated Press on Nov. 7 announced former Vice President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.  “@PressSec has already begun packing up,” the tweet reads. “She erased the last 5 days or so from her Twitter account. Kayleigh honey you’re jumping ship too late.” (RELATED: Did Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Lose 48 Million Twitter Followers After Endorsing Joe Biden For President?)  While a search of the press secretary Twitter account shows no tweets between Oct. 30 and Nov. 6, it appears to be because McEnany did not tweet from that account during that time frame, not because she deleted tweets. McEnany has been tweeting about the election from her personal Twitter account, @kayleighmcenany. Her personal account shows tweets from each of the five days before Nov. 6. Check Your Fact also searched ProPublica’s archive of political figures’ deleted tweets, but found none from the press secretary’s account between Nov. 1 and Nov. 6. ProPublica’s news applications developer, Derek Willis, confirmed to Check Your Fact in a Nov. 6 email that there was “no record of deletions from the PressSec account since Oct. 29.” McEnany responded to the claim in a tweet from the press secretary Twitter account on Nov. 6 saying, “This is fake news. I have not deleted any tweets, but you should delete this patently false tweet.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/stacy.evans.16752/posts/10160846855748973,https://twitter.com/PressSec,https://www.facebook.com/stacy.evans.16752/posts/10160846855748973,https://twitter.com/havjoul/status/1324730900379217921,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wins-white-house-ap-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9,https://twitter.com/PressSec,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/06/fact-check-dwayne-johnson-lose-48-million-twitter-followers-biden-endorsment/,https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/PressSec?page=1&per_page=50,https://www.propublica.org/people/derek-willis,https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1324753034291912704,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92e6e0f7e4fde0d2f1faf7f1f9ebfde7e0f4f3f1e6bcf1fdff",Did Kayleigh McEnany Delete ‘5 Days Or So’ Of Tweets After The Election?,,,,,,

Fact Check: The video, which has been shared on Twitter and YouTube, shows people examining papers at a dumpster, with the caption saying, “BUSTED! Ballots For Donald Trump Found In Spalding County, GA Dumpster.” It has also been shared on Facebook. The Spalding County Sheriff’s Office released a statement Nov. 6 debunking the claim that ballots cast for Trump were found in the dumpster featured in the video. (RELATED: Did Virginia Election Workers Take Ballots Home On Election Night?)  According to the statement, the Spalding County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call at the Elections Office regarding “paperwork that had been located in a dumpster behind the building.” Sheriff Darrell Dix instructed the responding officer to “clear the people from around the area of the dumpster, block off the area with crime scene tape, notify our on-call investigator and crime scene investigator and have them respond to the scene,” per the statement. “There were no ballots found in the dumpster by anyone last night,” Dix said in the statement. “There were no ballots found in any of the contents of the dumpster that were searched this morning by the Secretary of State’s Office and my investigators. What was found were empty envelopes that were used to mail ballots to the elections office. Those envelopes are marked ‘Ballot.’ Each had been opened and they were all empty.” The sheriff also said in the statement that “there were documents, not ballots, found in the contents of the dumpster that for security reasons, were improperly disposed of.” Sheriff’s deputies searched the dumpsters and trash cans at Spalding County’s other polling places for documents but, according to Dix’s statement, no “documents or elections materials were found at any of those polling places.” The investigation has been turned over to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, according to the Spalding County Sheriff’s Office statement.

Verdict: False   There is no evidence election workers took ballots home on Election Night. A spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Elections said ballots “are maintained in a secure location.” Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a Nov. 4 tweet from the Twitter user @JusticeMAGA that alleges Virginia election workers “decided to call it a night and… GET THIS… They took the uncounted ballots HOME WITH THEM” on Election Night. The Twitter user appears to be suggesting that the workers would do something “nefarious” with the ballots at home.  However, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find reporting from local media outlets such as the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Virginian-Pilot and NBC12 about election officials taking uncounted ballots home on Election Night. The post does not specify where in Virginia the alleged incident occurred and provides no sources for the allegation, further adding to its dubiousness. “Officers of Election do not take ballots home,” Andrea Gaines, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Elections, said in an email to the DCNF. “Ballots are maintained in a secure location.” (RELATED: Does This TV Screen Show Actual Presidential Election Results?)

Barbara Gunter, the Bedford County Registrar, said “chain of custody forms are used for all of the official voting equipment and reporting, numbered and tamper evident seals are used, security cages and locks.” Henry County Registrar Elizabeth Stone said the county’s voting machines “are programmed, locked and sealed and any tampering would be evident.” The Associated Press called the presidential race in Virginia for former Vice President Joe Biden on Election Night.

Verdict: False The Wisconsin Elections Commission estimates 2020 voter turnout is about 73%. Voter turnout in the state has only increased roughly 5% from 2016.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a tweet from conservative commentator Harlan Hill showing the alleged voter turnout rate for Wisconsin for election years between 2000 and 2020. In the tweet, Wisconsin voter turnout allegedly jumped nearly 22% from 2016 to 2020. The screen grabbed tweet attempts to use the alleged jump in voter turnout between 2016 and 2020 to suggest there was voter fraud in Wisconsin, saying, “Totally believable LOLOLOLOL They’re stealing this!” However, the state did not actually see such a jump. (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Wisconsin Had More Votes Cast Than Registered Voters)  Voter turnout in Wisconsin is determined by looking at how many people voted in proportion to the voting age population, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The unofficial tally shows that nearly 3.3 million people voted in Wisconsin as of press time and the state’s estimated 2020 voting age population is about 4.5 million people, which gives a voter turnout rate of roughly 73%. The Wisconsin Elections Commission unofficially estimates a turnout rate of about 72.6%, Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The current unofficial 2020 voter turnout rate for Wisconsin appears to be roughly in line with previous election years, increasing approximately 5% from 2016. The claim that Wisconsin saw an 89% voter turnout rate may have come from dividing the number of people who voted by the number of registered voters in the state, instead of the voting age population. “The problem is that some people (including some clerks) are reporting turnout as a percentage of registered voters, which is an irrelevant number,” Magney said in an email to the DCNF. “Unlike many other states, Wisconsin has Election Day registration. That means citizens with proper proof of residence and a valid, government-issued photo ID can walk in to a polling place and register to vote and get a ballot. Across the state, 100,000 or more people do this in any election. Wisconsin uses the Voting Age Population to calculate voter turnout. This is a standard practice among most state election administrators.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.

Verdict: False The video shows election workers transcribing information from damaged ballots onto blank ballots so that they could be counted, according to the Delaware County Bureau of Elections.   Fact Check: The zoomed-in video comes from a livestream of ballot counting in Pennsylvania’s Delaware County. In the video, an election worker in a dark-colored shirt appears to be filling out ballots while another worker sitting across the table holds other papers. “Voter Fraud.” one Facebook page that posted the video claimed. “This lady has been at it an hour. Pennsylvania camera number 7.” (RELATED: There Have Been A Lot of Allegations Of Election Fraud. We Looked Into Them)  The video, however, does not show poll workers committing voter fraud. In a statement to Check Your Fact, the Delaware County Bureau of Elections explained that the workers were manually transcribing information from damaged ballots onto blank ballots so that the votes could be counted. “During the processing of ballots, a machine extractor opens the ballots. Some ballots were damaged by the extractor during this process in such a way that the ballots could not be scanned successfully. According to the scanner manufacturer, Hart, the best practice to deal with damaged ballots that cannot be scanned is to transcribe the votes on each ballot to a clean ballot and scan the clean ballot,” the statement from the Delaware County Bureau of Elections said. “In accordance with that guidance, the Chief Clerk of the Delaware County Bureau of Elections instructed elections staff to manually transcribe the damaged ballots. As ballots were being transcribed, the original damaged ballots were directly beside the new ballots and bipartisan observers witnessed the process at close range. Damaged ballots have been preserved.” Pennsylvania’s Election Code requires that “if any ballots or district total cards are damaged or defective so that they cannot be properly counted by the central automatic tabulating equipment, a true duplicate copy shall be made and substituted for any such damaged ballot or card.” The duplicate ballots must be clearly labeled as such and bear a serial number that is documented on the damaged or defective ballot, according to the code. According to the statement from the Delaware County Bureau of Elections, the county has been livestreaming the ballot counting since Nov. 3 as a transparency measure. Delaware County spokesperson Adrienne Marofsky said the video being shared online crops out the bipartisan observers watching the workers from six feet away to make it seem like they weren’t being observed, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. “Unfortunately, some residents have altered the video and are making false accusations, which baselessly and wrongly attack the integrity of the election staff and the completely transparent process by which votes are being counted in Delaware County,” the Bureau of Elections’ statement said. County Council President Brian Zidek told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the same process was used in 2016 to count a smaller amount of mail-in ballots.

Verdict: False The deceased man mentioned did not cast a vote. A clerical error was made and then corrected concerning a ballot cast by his son, who shares the same name. Votes cast in the name of dead individuals do not count, according to Michigan election officials.   Fact Check: The video appears to be a screen recording of someone looking up the status of his absentee ballot. Information for a man named William Bradley, born in 1902, is entered and the results seem to show that his absentee ballot had been received. (RELATED: Video Falsely Claims To Show ‘Ballot Stuffing’ In Michigan) “For those who don’t believe in voter fraud,” the video’s caption reads. “This is nuts. William Bradley a 118 year old dead person apparently voted via absentee ballot in Wayne County Michigan. Bradley died in 1984. How long has this scam been going on?”  However, no ballots cast by a William Bradley who died in 1984 were counted in the election. Daniel Baxter, an election consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections, told Politifact and other fact-checking outlets, that no ballot for a 118-year-old William Bradley counted in the election and the confusion was caused by a clerical error. “No ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted,” Baxter said. “A man with a nearly identical name requested a ballot and voted properly in both the primary and general elections. When his ballot was initially logged, however, it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago through a clerical error.” Check your Fact found that a younger William Tarnell Bradley, seemingly the deceased William Bradley’s son, lives in the same house that his father did. The still-living William Bradley told Politifact that he received and cast a ballot for himself, and while he also received one for the dead William Bradley, he threw it away. Tracy Wimmer, the direct of media relations for the Michigan secretary of state, told Check Your Fact in an email that “ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day.” “On rare occasions, a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead,” Wimmer explained. “This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file; for example, someone born in 1990 accidentally recorded as born in 1890. In such scenarios, no one ineligible has actually voted, and there is no impact on the outcome of the election. Local clerks can correct the issue when it is brought to their attention.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The registered voter numbers are outdated. More recent data from the state governments show that ballots cast in the states have not exceeded the numbers of registered voters as of press time. The states have also not reported voter turnout over 100 percent.   Fact Check:  The pictured table, which cites RealClearPolitics and World Population Review, claims to list the current number of registered voters in eight states: Nevada, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia. In the table, all of the states except Georgia appear to show higher projected votes and voter turnout than registered voters, seemingly suggesting voter fraud in those states. World Population Review previously displayed the numbers of registered voters from the Census Bureau’s “Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2018” but has since updated the page. The pictured table appears to draw its figures for registered voters from World Population Review’s old data.  All of the registered voter numbers in the table are outdated and lower than figures recently reported by the state governments. Here are the numbers of registered voters for each state: Nevada: 1,821,864 active registered voters as of Nov. 5, per the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office Pennsylvania: 9,091,371 registered voters as of Nov. 2, per the Pennsylvania Department of State Minnesota: 3,588,563 registered voters as of Nov. 2, per the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office North Carolina: 7,361,219 registered voters as of Nov. 3, per the North Carolina State Board of Elections Wisconsin: 3,684,726 active registered voters as of Nov. 1, per the Wisconsin Elections Commission Michigan: 8,128,430 registered voters (no date), per the Michigan Department of State Arizona: 4,281,152 active registered voters as of Nov. 3, per the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office Georgia: 7,233,584 active registered voters as of Nov. 1, per statistics from the Georgia Secretary of State. Some of the states listed offer same-day voter registration, according to CBS News, meaning their registered voter numbers may be higher than the publicly available data. (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Wisconsin Had More Votes Cast Than Registered Voters) While states are still counting ballots and, thus, their vote tallies may change, the number of votes cast in the eight states have not exceeded their numbers of registered voters at the time of publication. According to voting data from The Associated Press, here are the numbers of votes cast in each state as of 4 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 6: Nevada: over 1.2 million votes Pennsylvania: over 6.6 million votes Minnesota: over 3.2 million votes North Carolina: over 5.4 million votes Wisconsin: nearly 3.3 million votes Michigan: over 5.5 million votes Arizona: over 3.1 million votes Georgia: over 4.9 million votes None of the states listed in the table have reported voter turnout over 100 percent, contrary to the post’s claim. The 2020 presidential election has seen high voter turnout, according to the Washington Post. The Associated Press called the presidential race in Minnesota for former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the outlet also called the races in Michigan and Wisconsin for Biden. Other states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania have not yet been called.

Gretchen Whitmer said, “I will not certify the vote in my state for Donald Trump, no matter the outcome.”  Verdict: False There is no record of Whitmer making the statement. The governor does not certify election results in Michigan.   Fact Check: The post features a photo of Whitmer speaking into a microphone with what appears to be a moustache drawn on her upper lip. The post quotes Whitmer as allegedly saying, “I will not certify the vote in my State for Donald Trump, no matter the outcome.” But there is no evidence that Whitmer ever made the remark attributed to her in the Facebook post. A search of her verified twitter accounts – @GovWhimer and @gretchenwhitmer – turned up no similar comment. National and local media outlets also haven’t attributed the quote to her in their reporting.  Michigan’s secretary of state, not the governor, serves as the chief election officer. The Board of Canvassers in each city, township and county reviews and certifies election results for their jurisdictions, according to the Michigan Secretary of State website. Each Board of Canvassers has two Republicans and two Democrats. “Similarly, a four-member Board of State Canvassers certifies the results of all statewide offices, district offices that cross county lines and statewide ballot proposals,” the Michigan Secretary of State website further explains. “Once all the canvassers have met, the results are considered final.” Tiffany Brown, Whitmer’s press secretary, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the post’s attribution is “inaccurate.” (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Michigan Ballots Marked With Sharpie Will Not Be Counted) The claim may stem from comments made by President Donald Trump at an October rally held in Michigan. “Be careful of her and her attorney general because you know they’re like, in charge of the ballot stuff, right?” Trump said, per CNN. “So how the hell do I put my political and our country’s political life in the hands of a pure partisan like that?” The Associated Press called the battleground state of Michigan for former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Approximately 3,000 ballots are expected to be rejected across the state, the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office has told reporters.   Fact Check: Featured in the Instagram post is a screen grab of a now-deleted tweet from former Democratic State Senate candidate Gil Freeman that alleges “40,000 rejected vote by mail ballots in DeKalb County need to be cured by Friday or they will be tossed.” Ballot curing is the process that allows voters to resolve issues, often related to signatures, with their ballots so that they can be counted, according to ABC affiliate WJBF. The deadline to do so in Georgia is Nov. 6, three days after Election Day, per the National Conference of State Legislatures. (RELATED: Viral Video Falsely Claims Ballots Marked With Sharpie Were Invalidated In Arizona)  The number of DeKalb County ballots that need to be cured is greatly exaggerated in the Instagram post. As of Nov. 4, the county had about 200 preliminarily rejected ballots that need to be cured, according to a tweet from the DeKalb County Board of Registration and Elections.  Voters: there is incorrect info circulating regarding the number of DeKalb ballots that need to be cured by Friday.

Verdict: False The video, taken in 2018, appears to show an incident during an election in Russia.   Fact Check: In recent days, misinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election has been circulating on social media. This Facebook post shares CCTV video in which two women, one in a blue sweater and another in a floral dress, are allegedly at a polling place in Michigan stuffing multiple pieces of paper into a ballot box. “Ballot stuffing in Michigan removed from Twitter,” one Facebook user remarked. (RELATED: Do These Photos Show Bricks Laid Out For Riots In Detroit?)  But there is no evidence that the video depicts such an incident in the battleground state of Michigan. A search of local news outlets such as WXYZ Detroit, Michigan Live and the Detroit Free Press found no reports of ballot box stuffing occurring in Michigan on Election Day. The video appears to be from 2018, when both AFP News Agency and The Washington Post posted it on their respective YouTube channels. “Election observers highlighted CCTV footage provided by Russia’s Electoral Commission which appeared to show staff putting extra votes into a ballot box at a polling station in the Russian city of Lyubertsy on the outskirts of Moscow,” reads the description of the AFP News Agency video. “The Electoral Commission has acknowledged this instance appears to show fraud, and has said fraudulent votes will be cancelled.” The ballot box in the center of the apparent polling place is decorated with a red and gold emblem that bears resemblance to the Russian coat of arms, further indicating that the incident did not take place in Michigan. “That’s not a Michigan ballot box, nor a Michigan ballot tabulator,” confirmed Jake Rollow, director of communications and external affairs at the Michigan Department of State, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Nor is it clear the video was shot in a voting location, or even in Michigan.” The Associated Press called the presidential election in Michigan for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Fact Check: The video shows a man unloading something from a white van into a red wagon and wheeling it into Detroit’s TCF Center. The woman heard speaking in the video suggests that the man is surreptitiously bringing ballots to the ballot-counting center. “They’re bringing in ballots in coolers.

Verdict: False Michigan election officials have confirmed Sharpie pens can be used to mark ballots and using them will not invalidate votes.   Fact Check: On Wednesday, claims that Michigan ballots marked with Sharpie pens would not be counted as votes circulated on social media. The Associated Press, Fox News and CNN called the presidential race in the battleground state of Michigan for Democratic candidate Joe Biden the same day. This particular Facebook post shows an alleged hotline people can call if they “observe any issues at the polls” and urges Michigan voters to do so if they were given a Sharpie to fill out their ballots. “If you were given a black sharpie marker to fill out your ballot, call the MI number below to report your polling location!” the post says. “The machines will successfully count your ballot but not your vote, because the machines only detect black pen ink!”  Contrary to the post’s claim, Sharpies can be used to mark ballots in Michigan, and using one will not result in a person’s vote being canceled. Michigan Department of State Director Of Communications and External Affairs Jake Rollow referred Check Your Fact via email to the department’s Nov. 5 tweet thread addressing so-called “SharpieGate.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Michigan ‘Magically Found’ Over 130,000 Votes Cast For Joe Biden)  Fact check: The use of a Sharpie to mark a ballot will not invalidate or cancel a ballot or vote. If the marker does bleed through to the other side, ballots are designed so that the bleed through does not touch or come near a voting area on the other side of the ballot. 1/2 — Michigan Department of State (@MichSoS) November 5, 2020   It will not alter or cancel any vote on the opposite side. The Sharpie is the recommended marking instrument by the tabulator manufacturer and is preferable to an ink pen because it dries quickly and will not leave residue on the ballot scanner. — Michigan Department of State (@MichSoS) November 5, 2020  “The use of a Sharpie to mark a ballot will not invalidate or cancel a ballot or vote,” the thread states.  “If the marker does bleed through to the other side, ballots are designed so that the bleed through does not touch or come near a voting area on the other side of the ballot.” “It will not alter or cancel any vote on the opposite side,” it continued. “The Sharpie is the recommended marking instrument by the tabulator manufacturer and is preferable to an ink pen because it dries quickly and will not leave residue on the ballot scanner.” Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons also took to Twitter to address questions she received about ballots filled out with Sharpies in her county, saying, “Sharpies are the preferred device of our election equipment vendor. Black or blue pen also acceptable for proper tabulating. Bleed through is not a concern as ballots are programmed to ignore bleed.” The false claim about Sharpie ballots previously circulated during the 2018 Michigan election, according to the Detroit Free Press. Michigan isn’t the only state during the 2020 presidential election to see false claims about votes being invalidated if ballots were filled out with Sharpie markers. Check Your Fact on Wednesday debunked a similar rumor about Arizona ballots.

(RELATED: Did Donald Trump Tweet, ‘If I Lose The Election, I’m Nuking California’?) In this particular image, a TV screen appears to be broadcasting a breaking news report with the chyron saying, “Biden Elected 46th President.” It includes graphics showing Biden winning 289 electoral votes and 49.62 percent of the popular vote, while depicting President Donald Trump as garnering 249 electoral votes and 46.07 percent of the popular vote. An “EP” logo appears in the corner.  While at first glance the image appears authentic, it does not show actual presidential election results but rather a YouTube channel’s prediction. The graphic shown on the TV screen comes from a video, titled “Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden | Election Night Prediction,” that was uploaded to YouTube in June 2020 and can be seen at the roughly 38:10 mark. Election Predictions Official, the channel that posted the video, describes itself as the “fastest growing political channel on Youtube, featuring election predictions, analysis, and so much more.” The winner of the 2020 presidential election has not been declared at the time of publication. Pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina remain too close to call as of press time, according to The New York Times.

Verdict: False The image, which is at least two years old, does not show shredded 2020 ballots. The Escambia County Supervisor of Elections Office and Florida Attorney General’s Office said they had not received reports of such a thing.   Fact Check: The image shows a screen grab of a Nov. 3 tweet, allegedly from a poll worker in Pensacola, that claims to depict someone holding shredded ballots. The tweet reads, “Up early and working at the polling stations in Pensacola and boy (don’t spread this around lol) I am shredding up so many Trump ballots.” There is, however, no evidence the image shows a shredded 2020 ballot cast for Trump. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the photo is at least two years old, having been posted to the Thrift Store Hauls subreddit page in 2018. The Reddit post reads, “Found a $2500 NSA Level 6 Security Shredder for $30.”  Brandi Zigler, the outreach and training coordinator for the Supervisor of Elections Office in Escambia County, where Pensacola is located, told Check Your Fact via email: “We have no reason to believe this is true and have reported it to law enforcement.” The Florida Attorney General’s office was likewise unaware of such an incident, saying in an email, “Our office has received no related citizen inquiries on this matter.” The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office and the Pensacola Police Department also told Check Your Fact via phone that they had not received any reports of ballots cast for Trump being shredded. (RELATED: Viral Post Falsely Claims 23% Of Mail-In Ballots In Miami-Dade County Were Rejected For Missing Signatures) Searching the websites of local media outlets such as Pensacola News Journal, ABC affiliate WEAR TV and CBS affiliate WKRG News didn’t turn up any reporting to date about Pensacola poll workers shredding ballots cast for Trump. The account that tweeted the image, @martymoogle, has since been suspended on Twitter for violating the platform’s rules.

Verdict: False The burned pieces of paper were sample ballots, not ballots cast for Trump, according to the city of Virginia Beach.   Fact Check: The short video depicts someone off-camera throwing a plastic bag filled with alleged ballots cast for Trump on the ground. He then lights the bag on fire. “I’ve got around 80,” he says while the fire burns. “You work at the mail or polling place, you gotta do what you gotta do.” “Video of a man burning up Trump ballots and bragging about it,” the Facebook post’s caption states. “He implies he works at a mail or polling place and gives impression (sic) that many others did this too, like it was their job to destroy Trump ballots.”  However, the video does not actually show a poll worker burning ballots cast for Trump. A screen grab from the video showed that the papers being burned were actually sample ballots from Virginia Beach. The city addressed the claim in an “Election Brief” shared on its website on the evening of Nov. 3. (RELATED: Viral Video Falsely Claims Ballots Marked With Sharpie Were Invalidated In Arizona) “A concerned citizen shared a video with us that ostensibly shows someone burning ballots,” the statement reads. “They are NOT official ballots, they are sample ballots. See the attached freeze frame image and photo of the official ballots, which have the bar codes.” Trump’s son, Eric Trump, shared a tweet featuring the video on Nov. 4, per CNN. The Twitter account for Virginia Beach responded to the younger Trump’s tweet saying, “Those were sample ballots. Addressed this yesterday.” The account that first shared the video has since been suspended on Twitter for violating the platform’s rules, the outlet reported.

Democratic ran Michigan just magically found 138,339 votes overnight… LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE FOR BIDEN!!! Not even one for Trump. Democrats are attempting to steal this election and they aren’t even trying to hide it. A post shared by  Project War Path (@projectwarpath) on Nov 4, 2020 at 8:01am PST    Verdict: False The 138,339-vote increase for Biden shown in the image was the result of a clerical error in a Michigan county’s presidential election data that was quickly caught and corrected.   Fact Check: The post features screen grabs of interactive election results graphics from the election data provider Decision Desk HQ. The top graphic shows Biden with 1,992,356 votes and President Donald Trump with 2,200,902 votes in Michigan, while the one below shows Biden with 2,130,695 votes and Trump with 2,200,902. The vote tallies for the other three candidates displayed do not appear to have changed between the two graphics. “Democratic ran Michigan just magically found 138,339 votes overnight… LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE FOR BIDEN!!!” reads the caption. “Not even one for Trump. Democrats are attempting to steal this election and they aren’t even trying to hide it.”  GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak and other Twitter users shared the screen grabs along with similar claims. In reality, the increase of 138,339 votes for Biden was the result of a clerical error in Michigan’s Shiawassee County presidential election data that was quickly caught and corrected. When reached for comment, Decision Desk HQ President Drew McCoy directed Check Your Fact to a Nov. 4 tweet from the firm.  This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data,. Once we identified the error, we cleared the erroneous data and updated it with the correct data as provided by officials. We stand by our data as reflected on https://t.co/J7J00UQxN8. — Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) November 4, 2020  “This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data,” Decision Desk HQ tweeted on Wednesday. “Once we identified the error, we cleared the erroneous data and updated it with the correct data as provided by officials. We stand by our data as reflected on results.decisiondeskhq.com.” Decision Desk HQ tweeted the figures from the Instagram post’s bottom graphic at about 5 a.m. on Nov. 4. Roughly 40 minutes later, Decision Desk HQ tweeted updated figures that showed Trump with 2,217,540 votes and Biden with 2,019,899. “It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingested,” a spokesperson for Decision Desk HQ told BuzzFeed News. “DDHQ does not correct/amend/adjust any state provided file. The state noticed the error and produced an updated count. This happens on election nights and we expect other vote tabulators in MI experienced this error and corrected in real-time as we did.” Shiawassee County Clerk Caroline Wilson provided a similar explanation about the voting data in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Wisconsin Had More Votes Cast Than Registered Voters) “The error was a typo at the end-of-the-night/morning. Yes, an extra zero was typed when entering the Biden figures,” she said. “The mistake was caught very quickly and corrected with the extra zero being removed. At no point were the results jeopardized. It was a typo.” Mackowiak later deleted his tweet and noted that “the MI update referenced was a typo in one county.” During a Wednesday morning press conference streamed by Fox News, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said she hadn’t seen the screen grabs circulating on social media but asked “everyone to not repeat misinformation.” The presidential race in Michigan was called for Biden by The Associated Press, NBC News and Fox News on Wednesday.

Verdict: False Sharpies can be used in Arizona to fill out ballots, and the state’s tabulation machines can read them. If a ballot cannot be read by a tabulation machine, a ballot review board would duplicate it to ensure the vote gets counted.   Fact Check: The video features a woman who claims she witnessed poll workers at a voting site in Maricopa County forcing voters to use Sharpie pens that tabulation machines couldn’t read, resulting in canceled votes. One Nov. 3 iteration of the video was captioned “Tonight’s voting shenanigans” on Facebook. Despite online claims regarding the Sharpies, Arizona election officials have confirmed that Sharpies can be used to fill out ballots. Using them will not invalidate a ballot. (RELATED: Viral Image Falsely Claims Wisconsin Had More Votes Cast Than Registered Voters)  Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, for instance, tweeted on Nov. 4 that “if you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!” During an interview with local affiliate Fox 10, she expanded on the topic, saying, “I can assure voters that nobody in a polling place, a trained employed polling place worker is not going to give you a pen to mark your ballot that is going to invalidate your ballot.” The Maricopa County Elections Department also said that voters can use a Sharpie to fill out their ballots in an Oct. 26 tweet.  MARKING YOUR BALLOT: Did you know you can use a black or blue ballpoint pen and even sharpie to mark your ballot?

A “damaged or unreadable ballot” must be duplicated and tabulated by a “Ballot Duplication Board” that comprises of “at least two members who are registered voters not of the same political party,” the manual outlines. “The Ballot Duplication Board duplicates ballots that cannot be read by the tabulation machine but on which the voter has nonetheless clearly indicated their intent to vote on a particular race or ballot measure,” the manual states. “This may include crumpled or otherwise damaged ballots, ballots with smudged ink, or ballots which are marked in the wrong color of ink or with a device that cannot be read by the tabulation machine.” The Maricopa County Elections Department explained in a video posted on Twitter that a Sharpie has the “fastest-drying ink and works best on tabulation equipment.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While there was a pause in reporting results, Philadelphia election officials did not stop counting ballots on Election Night. The city commissioner has said election officials will not stop counting votes until they have counted all of them.   Fact Check: In recent days, social media platforms have become replete with misinformation regarding Election Day. This particular Facebook post claims election officials in Philadelphia stopped counting mail-in ballots Tuesday night, allegedly because they were “tired.” (RELATED: Do These Photos Show Bricks Laid Out For Riots In Detroit?) The Office of the Philadelphia City Commissioners began sharing a livestream on Nov. 3 showing workers counting ballots. The video is still live and has been sharing footage of ballot counters for at least the past 12 hours. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported around 12:30 a.m. on Nov. 4 that the feed showed “workers making their way through yellow bins full of ballots.”   Local outlet CBS 3 reported on Nov. 4 that Philadelphia officials said they counted roughly 186,000 mail-in ballots overnight and that voting counting had “continued through the night.” Over 150 election workers are working in eight-hour shifts 24-7 until every vote is counted,” according to the outlet. City Commissioner Al Schmidt tweeted at about 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 that Philadelphia “will NOT stop counting ALL legitimate votes cast by eligible voters” and at about 5 a.m. that they had “updated our results page to include more than 65,000 mail-in votes cast by Philadelphia voters, with many more to count.”  Philadelphia will NOT stop counting ALL legitimate votes cast by eligible voters. And we will report and report and report until the last vote is counted. See for yourself: https://t.co/El2XfWKxQw — Commissioner Al Schmidt (@Commish_Schmidt) November 4, 2020   Moments ago, we updated our results page to include more than 65,000 mail-in votes cast by Philadelphia voters, with many more yet to count. You can follow our results page here: https://t.co/Acrk5q3sYy — Commissioner Al Schmidt (@Commish_Schmidt) November 4, 2020  The claim may have originated from misunderstanding a since-deleted tweet from Max Marin, an independent reporter in Philadelphia. Marin tweeted in the evening on Nov. 3 saying, “no more mail ballot results tonight.” Counties also may update the state system less often than they do their own websites, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, further adding to the confusion.

Verdict: False Wisconsin had over 3.68 million active registered voters on Nov. 1, per the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Voting data from The Associated Press shows that the number of ballots cast in Wisconsin has not exceeded that Nov. 1 figure of active registered voters in the state as of Wednesday afternoon.   Fact Check:  The Facebook page 1776 United posted a screen grab of a now-unavailable Nov. 4 tweet from Mike Coudrey, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, activist and investor in his Twitter bio. The tweet suggested that the figures it provides are “direct evidence of fraud” in Wisconsin. “BREAKING: Wisconsin has more votes than people who are registered to vote,” read Coudrey’s tweet. “Total number of registered voters: 3,129,000. Total number of votes cast: 3,239,920. This is direct evidence of fraud.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Massive Wall Around The White House)  Data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission shows that the state had over 3.68 million active registered voters on Nov. 1, two days before Election Day. In addition, Wisconsin has same day voter registration, meaning that people eligible to vote can register and cast a vote on Election Day. Based on the screen grab in Coudrey’s now-deleted tweet, he appears to have gotten his inaccurate number for registered Wisconsin voters from the website World Population Review, which pulled the 3,129,000 registered voter figure from the Census Bureau’s data for “Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2018.” The state of Wisconsin had over 3.25 million active registered voters on Nov. 1, 2018, according to data on the Wisconsin Elections Commission website. The Wisconsin Elections Commission, seemingly in response to rumors about the state having more ballots cast than registered voters, tweeted relevant statistics on Wednesday.  The State of Wisconsin had 3,684,726 active registered voters on November 1, 2020. Wisconsin has election day registration, which means that the VR numbers some counties report in their unofficial results are not a true indictor of registration.https://t.co/3TknriWGI2 — Wisconsin Elections (@WI_Elections) November 4, 2020  “The State of Wisconsin had 3,684,726 active registered voters on November 1, 2020. Wisconsin has election day registration, which means that the VR numbers some counties report in their unofficial results are not a true indictor of registration,” the Wisconsin Elections Commission tweeted, adding that “there are never more ballots than registered voters.” The Associated Press, The New York Times and CNN projected on Wednesday afternoon that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will win Wisconsin. Biden leads by about 0.6 percentage points and just over 20,000 votes out of nearly 3.3 million votes, according to The Associated Press. President Donald Trump’s campaign has requested a recount.

Verdict: False The massive wall has been superimposed into a 2009 aerial photo of the White House.   Fact Check: Federal authorities installed temporary non-scalable fencing around the White House perimeter on Monday in preparation of the Nov. 3 election, according to ABC News. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show All The Lights Out At The White House During George Floyd Protests) Social media users later shared an aerial photo of the White House that purportedly shows that fencing, with one Facebook user commenting, “This is truly a sad spectacle.” In the image, a massive wall that appears to be as tall as nearby trees circles the White House perimeter.  Check Your Fact discovered through a reverse image search that the aerial photo has been altered to include the fence. The original photo, taken by Carol M. Highsmith in 2009, shows no such wall around the White House. Photos of the security fencing put up around the White House ahead of Election Day that are available on the Reuters and The Associated Press websites also show the wall in the Facebook image does not resemble what was actually installed. The additional fencing encompasses the Ellipse and Lafayette Square too, CNN reported. Similar fencing was erected near the White House amid the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer, though some of those barriers were later removed, according to USA Today.

Verdict: False The bricks were left over from a construction project. They were removed on Tuesday morning.   Fact Check:  Social media has been replete with rumors that piles of bricks were being deliberately set out in major U.S. cities in anticipation of civil unrest following Tuesday’s presidential election. This particular post claims to show two stacks of bricks that appeared on a Denver street corner on Election Day, despite there allegedly being no construction projects in the area. The pictured bricks, however, were not placed in anticipation of civil unrest. They were leftover from a road construction project that recently finished and had been left on the street corner for about a week, according to Colorado Public Radio. Paul Hansen, director of facilities for the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, later collected them.  “We didn’t want them to become projectiles if you know what I mean,” Hansen said to Colorado Public Radio. Denver photographer Kevin Beaty on Tuesday morning found the corner shown in the Facebook post and took a picture of it, showing the bricks had indeed been removed, the outlet reported. (RELATED: Does This Image Show An Antifa Flyer Calling For Riots After Election Day?) The City of Denver also stated in a Nov. 3 tweet that while there has been “no evidence of objects left to be used for non-peaceful protests,” police are removing items that could be used as projectiles.

Verdict: False There is no evidence the pictured bricks were placed for civil unrest. The Detroit Mayor’s Office confirmed that the pallets were part of a construction project.   Fact Check: The Facebook post shows two photos of brick pallets, both seemingly in a parking lot. The caption reads, “It’s all being set up again I’ve been seeing posts their finding pallets of bricks in downtown Detroit! This is the same thing that happened in Chicago, Boston and New York right before they set off the riots!” The photo on the left shows bricks used to build a screening wall near the Wayne State University Tierney Alumni House, according to the Detroit Free Press. A photo taken by Anjanette Delgado for the Detroit Free Press on Nov. 3 shows the pallet covered in black wrapping. John Hamood, the owner of the construction company building the screening wall, said he covered them after the owner of a nearby gas station asked him to do so, the outlet reported.  “There were not any loose bricks,” Hamood told the Detroit Free Press. “There are metal bands that strap them tightly together.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Police Officer Disfigured By An Antifa Activist?) The other photo also appears to have been taken near the Wayne State University Tierney Alumni House, based on the apartment building visible in the background. John Roach, the director of media relations for the Detroit Mayor’s office, told Check Your Fact in an email that one pile of bricks was gone and that the other pile was being used for construction. “Yes, the detroit police department became aware of this post and visited the location,” Roach said. “The bricks were gone by then. They also looked into a other post and determined the bricks at that location were there as part of an ongoing construction project.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo, which shows a ballot drop box location, appears to have been taken prior to Election Day. The Clifton Police Department said claims of voter intimidation occurring Clifton City Hall on Election Day were false, and the Passaic County Clerk’s Office said it had not received reports of people blocking access to voting locations.   Fact Check: The Facebook post reads, “Trump supporters are blocking access to polling sites at Clifton City Hall, New Jersey…this is a Class A Felony!!” It also features a photo depicting a man wearing a face mask and holding up a Trump 2020 flag. Behind him, on the man’s left (to the right of him in the photo) is an object local authorities have identified as a ballot box. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the image posted to Facebook on Nov. 1 with the caption also identifying the location as Clifton City Hall that day. The front of Clifton City Hall on Google Maps matches that in both photos, confirming the location. Clifton City Hall is not a polling site but does have a ballot drop box.  The Clifton Police Department addressed claims of voter intimidation occurring at the ballot box on Election Day in a Nov. 3 Facebook post, saying that they are “entirely false.” (RELATED: Did A Poll Worker From Pennsylvania’s Erie County Throw Out Ballots For Donald Trump?)  “However, there was an alleged incident that occurred two days ago in front of the aforementioned ballot box,” the department wrote. “This matter is under investigation, but does not appear to have any relation to voter intimidation.” The Passaic County Clerk’s Office, which has jurisdiction over Clifton, told Check Your Fact in an email that it “has not received information about anyone blocking access to voting locations.” It also noted that “this year’s election in New Jersey has been primarily vote-by-mail.” Check Your Fact verified that the photo shows a New Jersey ballot return box by comparing the markings on it to those shows taken at other ballot return locations such as the Union County Administration Building in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The claim that blocking access to a polling site would be a “Class A Felony” also doesn’t hold up. New Jersey uses numbers rather than letters to grade felony offenses. Such an action would, however, still be a violation of state law and be classified as a third-degree crime, according to the statute.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley Devlin and Trevor SchakohlContributor","https://www.facebook.com/ken.wheeler.336/posts/10158344333720804,https://www.facebook.com/ken.wheeler.336/posts/10158344333720804,https://perma.cc/YH98-K2F9?type=imagehttps://perma.cc/YH98-K2F9?type=image,https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8662498,-74.160428,3a,75y,354.77h,71.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJmxYV5Cwooxxd-sJOgAkZg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192,https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/vote-polling-location.shtml,https://www.facebook.com/CliftonNJPolice/posts/3773633115981142,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/11/03/fact-check-poll-worker-erie-county-pennsylvania-throw-donald-trump-ballots-away/,https://www.facebook.com/CliftonNJPolice/posts/3773633115981142,https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2020%3Anewsml_RC2YDI9ELMFP%3A2003415083&search=all%3ANew%20Jersey%20ballot%20box,https://www.newjerseycriminallawattorney.com/hudson-county/stages-criminal-case/indictable-felony/,https://nj.gov/state/dos-statutes-elections-19-31-39.shtml#ele_19_34_6",Did Trump Supporters Block A Polling Site At Clifton City Hall In New Jersey?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The screen grabbed post dates back to Oct. 13 and describes an issue that, according to the Fayette County Clerk, was quickly resolved that day, not on Election Day. Local media outlets haven’t reported on issues with Fayette County voting systems on Nov. 3.   Fact Check: Facebook user Jennifer Clark of Fayette County, Kentucky, detailed what she described as a “sketchy” voting experience in a now-deleted post on Oct. 13, Kentucky’s first day of early voting. The Facebook page Conservative Treehouse posted a screen grab of her post on Election Day, seemingly suggesting the incident occurred Tuesday. Her Facebook post, in part, read: “Poll workers had us register and gave us paper ballots to fill out (think scan tron). When we went to turn the paper ballot in, the election official said ‘the whole county’s system is down.’ ‘If you leave them with me, I promise I will turn them in for you at the end of the day.’ Um, no… When people objected, she said, ‘Then you’ll have to leave and come back a different day.'” Clark’s post went to say, “Turns out, the system wasn’t down at all. Turns out when everyone waited, the system magically was working after all…”  Actress Kirstie Alley quote tweeted on Tuesday another tweet showing a screen grab of Clark’s post. Lexington Herald Leader political reporter Daniel Desrochers reported in a tweet that Fayette County Clerk Donald Blevins called the tweet “false and misleading.” Blevins also said it was the result of an error by election officers on Oct. 13 that was resolved within 15 minutes, according to Desrochers. Check Your Fact didn’t find any local media outlets such as the Lexington Herald Leader and WVLK reporting county-wide voting system issues on Election Day. In a statement to local CBS affiliate WKYT, Blevins said that voting went smoothly on Tuesday. “I feel great, we’re actually doing very well today,” he said, per WKYT. “It’s going to be a nice bow on our package of voting for the last month.” (RELATED: Do Pennsylvania Quarantine Letters Tell People They Can’t Vote On Election Day?)

Verdict: False The bricks appear to have been part of a building project finished in October. There is no evidence that the image was taken Nov. 2.   Fact Check: Claims that piles of bricks were being strategically placed near Black Lives Matter protest sites throughout the U.S. to incite violence began spreading in early June, BuzzFeed News reported. While bricks were used to cause damage by some protesters, many instances of photos of bricks turned out to be related to construction projects, not civil unrest, according to Snopes. The image, which shows a screen grab of a Nov. 2 tweet, claims to show a stack of bricks outside of a store in Chicago. The tweet reads, “Supposedly piles of bricks mysteriously showing up in Chicago tonight. Lovely!” The Facebook user who shared the image remarked, “All assets deployed. Here we go.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Boston Police ‘Planting’ Bricks At George Floyd Protest Locations?)  However, there is no evidence a stack of bricks was intentionally placed outside the store in Chicago on Nov. 2. The bricks, which were left outside an ice cream shop in a suburb of Chicago, appear to have been used to build a brick patio wall for the nearby restaurant GIA MIA, per The Daily Dot. The patio was completed in October, freelance reporter Mikhail Thalen tweeted. Thalen further stated that a GIA MIA manager confirmed to him that the bricks were “removed some time ago,” suggesting the photo is outdated.  Additional note: Some people are asking why the bricks are still outside if the patio project was finished in October. I called GIA MIA and spoke to a manager who said the bricks are not outside and were removed some time ago, which suggests that the initial photo is old. — Mikael Thalen (@MikaelThalen) November 3, 2020  “Additional note: Some people are asking why the bricks are still outside if the patio project was finished in October,” the tweet reads. “I called GIA MIA and spoke to a manager who said the bricks are not outside and were removed some time ago, which suggests that the initial photo is old.” GIA MIA posted a photo of the completed patio wall to Facebook on Oct. 19.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The flyer is a hoax that has been circulating online for since at least 2017.   Fact Check: The alleged flyer seems to show an altered version of artist Banksy’s “Love Is In The Air” with the bouquet of flowers replaced by what appears to be a molotov cocktail. The text within the supposed flyer encourages “antifa comrades” to disguise themselves as “patriots/Trump supports, wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias” to riot on Nov. 4. “This way police and patriots responding to us won’t know who their enemies are, and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it’s harder to turn popular opinion against us,” the alleged flyer goes on to say.  Iterations of the image have been circulating on Facebook since at least 2017, according to data from CrowdTangle. In 2017, when online rumors linked it to antifa violence, Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer described the flyer as one of several “fabricated ‘planning documents’ that urge antifa guerillas to commit violence while posing as police or Trump supporters.” The image started recirculating in recent months after Facebook user Katy Krasnow posted it in the group “Hickman County Antifa,” according to Snopes. Some iterations of the claim feature a screen grab of her Facebook post. The “Hickman County Antifa Group” no longer appears to be available. “Hickman County Antifa was a satire page, either the creator or Facebook took it down, that post was just a bad joke,” Krasnow told Snopes. “I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected, nobody in the group was really actually connected, we were just sharing dumb antifa memes.” Law Enforcement Today called the flyer a “hoax,” and other fact-checkers have previously debunked 2020 iterations of the flyer.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBradley DevlinGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Bradley on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=641885606742215&id=100027623433265,https://hexagongallery.com/catalog/artist/banksy/love-is-in-the-air/,https://apps.crowdtangle.com/search/results?customStartDate=2017-01-02T01:07:00&customEndDate=2020-11-04T01:07:11&customChartStartDate=2016-01-02T04:59:59&customChartEndDate=2020-11-04T01:07:31&platform=facebook&postTypes=&producerTypes=3&q=antifa%20comrades&sortBy=score&sortOrder=desc&timeframe=custom,https://medium.com/@willsommer/how-the-november-4-antifa-conspiracy-theory-took-over-the-pro-trump-internet-a8e8f409d1f,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/antifa-flyer-trump-supporters/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/589929098378064/permalink/625443941493246/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/antifa-flyer-trump-supporters/,https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/is-there-an-antifa-riot-planned-for-the-day-after-the-election/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/18/viral-image/no-antifa-activists-arent-disguising-themselves-tr/,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/09/fact-check-antifa-is-not-calling-for-election-rioting-by-memebers-dressed-like-trump-supporters-to-shift-blame.htmlv,https://twitter.com/bradleydevlin",Does This Image Show An Antifa Flyer Calling For Riots After Election Day?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The user who posted the Instagram story is not a poll worker, according to the Erie County Board of Elections. All voters in Erie County use a ballot scanner to cast their completed ballots.   Fact Check: The image, which appears to be a screen grab from an Instagram story, purportedly shows a poll worker bragging that he threw out ballots cast for Trump so that Pennsylvania would “turn blue.” “Been working at a poll station in Erie county, PA all morning,” the screen grabbed Instagram story reads. “A lot of people have already voted today 🙂 I’ve thrown out over a hundred ballots for trump already!! Pennsylvania gonna turn blue 2020!!”  The Erie County Board of Elections released a statement Tuesday debunking the “false claim” that the Instagram user is a poll worker. (RELATED: Do Pennsylvania Quarantine Letters Tell People They Can’t Vote Until Election Day?) “Erie County has checked into the unfortunate claim being shared across social media by someone saying they are working as part of the Erie County Board of Elections and throwing out ballots,” the statement from Erie County Board of Elections Chair Carl J. Anderson III reads. “The person making the statements does not work in any way with Erie County or have any part of Erie County’s election process. In fact, the individual is not a registered voter and is not believed to be a resident of Erie County, Pa.” The statement goes on to say that it is now “part of an ongoing investigation to pursue potential criminal charges.” The Erie County Board of Elections also said that it “takes the integrity of the election process very seriously.” The Erie County Voting System webpage states that “some voters in Erie County will use the Dominion Imagecast X to mark their ballot,” while “some voters will vote using a hand-marked paper ballot.” All Erie County voters will “use the ImageCast Precinct Scanner to cast their completed ballot,” according to the webpage. The claim appears to have first spread on Twitter, and the Trump War Room account retweeted a tweet highlighting the inaccurate information.

It appears that the tweet has been fabricated.   Fact Check: In recent weeks, social media has become replete with misinformation about both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. One particular Facebook post shared what appears to be a screen grab of an Oct. 31 tweet from Trump threatening the state of California if he loses the 2020 presidential election. “If I lose the election, I’m nuking California. I’m not even kidding,” the alleged tweet reads. “Frisco’s getting a can of liquid sunshine. The only star in Hollywood will be the one detonated two miles above that stupid sign.” (RELATED: Did Trump Refuse To Provide California Aid To Fight The Wildfires?)  While Trump did previously tweet on Oct. 12 that, “California is going to hell,” there is no evidence that he ever tweeted what is attributed to him in the image. Had Trump actually sent such a tweet, media outlets would have almost assuredly reported on it, yet no reports exist. A search of his verified Twitter accounts — @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — turned up no similar remarks. Nor could the tweet be found in ProPublica’s archive of Trump’s deleted tweets. Multiple humor and entertainment Facebook pages shared the tweet, indicating it may have been fabricated as a joke, though some users shared it as if it were genuine. Trump tweets are often fabricated and spread by social media users using websites such as FakeTrumpTweet.com.

Verdict: False The letters do not mention Election Day. Pennsylvania voters who are unable to vote in person due to COVID-19 diagnosis or quarantine for possible exposure can complete an emergency absentee ballot and have a designee or county official return it by 8 p.m. on Election Day.   Fact Check: The Wendy Bell Radio Facebook page made the claim Monday in an attempt to suggest that the Pennsylvania Department of Health is trying to suppress voters through letters “demanding” they quarantine on Election Day due to COVID-19 exposure. “The letter states that they’ve been exposed to Covid-19 (no proof given) and, as such, must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day,” the viral post reads, in part. “If they fail to obey the order, they face possible arrest.” (RELATED: No, Pennsylvania Did Not Reject 372,000 Mail-In Ballots)  The letter, which has been sent out since March, does not mention Election Day, though it does instruct people that have been exposed to COVID-19 to self-quarantine for 14 days. It also states that the health secretary can petition the court and, to the extent necessary, call upon law enforcement to “ensure your compliance with this directive,” according to a copy of the letter provided to Check Your Fact by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Maggi Mumma, the deputy press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told Check Your Fact in an email that people who receive such a letter “would be a contact of a positive case and would have spoken to our contact tracers.” She also said that “Pennsylvania has not asked the court to order anyone to stay home for violating quarantine during this pandemic.” Pennsylvania law ensures that people in quarantine can vote by using an emergency absentee ballot, Erie News Now reported. If such a person cannot find a representative to pick up and return their emergency ballot, the law requires the county election officials to have a sheriff’s deputy or other county official help provide and return the ballot materials, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said in a press release. The voter or authorized representative must return the emergency absentee ballot to the county elections board by 8 p.m. on Election Day.

Verdict: False The letter is a fabrication and originates from a website known for publishing satire. Fact Check:   The alleged letter started recirculating after Connery, an actor known for portraying James Bond, died Oct. 31 at the age of 90. In the letter, Connery purportedly declines an offer to participate in an Apple advertisement in 1998. “I will say this one more time. You do understand English, don’t you?” Connery allegedly wrote. “I do not sell my soul for Apple or any other company. I have no interest in ‘changing the world’ as you suggest. You have nothing that I need or want. You are a computer salesman — I am f****** JAMES BOND!” (RELATED: Did CS Lewis Give This Advice On Starting Over?) However, the letter is fabricated. Check Your Fact traced it back to an article published on Scoopertino, a website that describes itself as “an imaginary news organization devoted to ferreting out the most relevant stories in the world of Apple, whether or not they actually occurred.” Other satirical articles on Scoopertino bear headlines such as “Apple buys Yosemite Park to promote new OS X” and “VATICAN SHOCKER: Cardinals tap Siri as next pope.”  The letter first went viral on Twitter in 2011 after British marketing executive John Willshire shared the letter, believing it was real, CNET reported. Willshire later sent a tweet clarifying that the letter was fake and he had been fooled, according to the outlet.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no indication Biden has proposed taxing 401(k) accounts. He has proposed “equalizing tax benefits” for using such accounts with a flat refundable tax credit.   Fact Check: Social media users have shared multiple dubious claims about the former vice president’s tax plan. This particular Facebook post alleges, “Biden slipped up and came out saying he was going to tax your 401k is anyone paying attention.” There is, however, no indication Biden aims to tax 401(k) retirement accounts if elected president. Such a proposal does not appear on Biden’s official campaign website. The viral post appears to be misrepresenting Biden’s proposed reforms on how 401(k)s and IRAs will be treated under the tax code.  Under current law, traditional retirement accounts allow people to defer taxes on contributions, making them deductible when calculating adjusted gross income, according to the Tax Foundation. Taxes are paid on 401(k)s when you withdraw the funds. Biden has proposed “equalizing the tax benefits of defined contribution plans” so that “low- and middle-income workers will also get a tax break when they put money away for retirement,” according to his campaign website. He aims to do so by giving taxpayers a flat refundable tax credit that policy analysts estimate would be about 26 percent instead of a tax deduction, according to CNBC. Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told Check Your Fact in an email that “there is no proposed ‘tax’ on 401ks” in Biden’s plan. (RELATED: Has Joe Biden Proposed An Annual 3% Federal Tax On Homes?) “Under the Biden plan, 401ks are still tax subsidized for everyone, but some 401k contributors get more subsidy than under current law, some are unaffected, and some get less tax subsidy,” Mermin explained. “Everything about 401ks is the same under the proposal (grow tax free, pay tax on withdrawal) except the tax treatment of contributions. Instead of contributing with pre-tax dollars, you contribute with after-tax dollars and get a refundable tax credit.” He said that “everyone still sees their taxes reduced when contributing to a 401k,” noting that “Some contributors with incomes below 400,000 will get larger tax subsidies than under current law, some with incomes below 400,000 will see no change in their tax break for retirement saving, and contributors with incomes above 400,000 will generally get smaller tax subsidies than under current law.” In an analysis of Biden’s proposed refundable tax credit for traditional retirement vehicles, the Tax Foundation’s Garrett Watson said that it “takes the rising value of deductibility by income level and converts it into a flat deduction” that would benefit “taxpayers in the 10 percent and 12 percent tax brackets,” while reducing the benefit for those in higher tax brackets. Watson also noted that the credit is “expected to be roughly revenue neutral.” This fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence voters in Queens are receiving pre-marked ballots. The New York City Board of Elections called the claim false, stating that the voter received a blank ballot and it appeared to have been filled out by hand.   Fact Check: Social media users have been sharing an image of a Queens general election ballot purportedly pre-marked for the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The image caption originates from an Oct. 29 tweet posted by Twitter user Jake Novak, who describes himself on Twitter as, among other things, a freelance editorial columnist for CNBC. “BREAKING NEWS: Several Queens Village (NY) residents are receiving pre-filled out ballots for Joe Biden and being told to just send them back to the Board of Elections,” the tweet and caption read. “This is blatantly ILLEGAL.”  The Facebook page that shared the image, New York for Donald Trump 2020 — which is not affiliated with the campaign, per its own disclaimer — asks, “What is going on with New York?” (RELATED: Viral Post Falsely Claims 23% Of Mail-In Ballots In Miami-Dade County Were Rejected For Missing Signatures) Novak posted a video examining the purportedly pre-filled out ballot to his Twitter account on Oct. 29. In the video, Novak alleged that the ballot had been marked for every Democratic candidate and that it appeared to have been done by a stamp or machine. The video also include the voter ID number. The New York City Board of Elections called the claim “false” in a pair of Oct. 30 tweets, noting that it “looks like it was filled out by hand and we have previously stated we have not received any reports of this happening.” Election officials confirmed the pictured ballot had been sent to an absentee voter in California. The voter mistakenly used the wrong envelope when they placed it in the mail, resulting in it being sent to the person’s previous address in Queens rather than the board of elections, according to Snopes. “This is the height of irresponsibility to continue to make these false claims,” tweeted the New York City Board of Elections. “We have communicated directly with the voter in question, who received a BLANK absentee ballot.

Verdict: False Less than one percent of mail-in ballots have been preliminarily rejected for not having a signature in Miami-Dade County as of Nov. 2, according to a spokesperson for the county’s elections department.   Fact Check: The screen grabbed tweet reads, “Miami Dade reporting 23% of early ballots being REJECTED for missing signatures … REALLY * REALLY IMPORTANT FOKS: RETWEET TILL YOUR FINGERS GET TIRED!!” While the post uses the term “early ballots,” it appears to be referencing mail-in ballots, as it links to a page on the Miami-Dade Democratic Party website that gives instructions on how voters can fix a mail-in ballot rejected for not having a signature or for a signature matching issue. Mail-in ballots in all states must have a voter signature in order to be counted, according to ABC News. Many states also use signature matching to verify the identities of voters by comparing the signatures on the mail-in ballots to signatures election officials have on file, per The New York Times. (RELATED: No, Pennsylvania Did Not Reject 372,000 Mail-In Ballots)  The post’s claim about 23% of Miami-Dade County mail-in ballots being rejected due to missing signatures is incorrect. Suzy Trutie, the deputy supervisor of elections at the Miami-Dade County Elections Department, told the Daily Caller News Foundation via email that as of Nov. 2, only 2,707 of 489,278 mail-in ballots, or about 0.55%, had issues. Of those 2,707 ballots with issues, 2,059 with no signature and 259 with signatures that did not match were preliminarily rejected, Trutie told the DCNF. Florida law allows voters the opportunity to submit an affidavit to “cure” their vote-by-mail ballots if they forgot to sign the envelope or the signature does not match the one on file, according to the Miami-Dade County Elections Department website. The affidavit must be completed and submitted to the voter’s county elections department along with a copy of identification by 5 P.M. local time on Nov. 5. Trutie said nearly 2,700 mail-in ballots that were preliminarily rejected for not having a signature or not having a matching signature have been cured as of Nov. 2. The 23% figure may stem from a misinterpretation of an Oct. 16 op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times written by University of Florida professor Daniel Smith and Dartmouth College professor Michael Herron. It noted, “Although Miami-Dade County accounts for only 7.2 percent of mail ballots cast by Florida voters, it accounts for nearly 23 percent of the state’s mail ballots received without signatures.” The op-ed did not attempt to claim that 23% of Miami-Dade County mail-in ballots have been rejected due to signature issues. Instead, it argued, in part, that the “pattern of mail ballots received by Supervisors of Elections is not distributed evenly across Florida,” citing Miami-Dade County and Orange County as outliers.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The photo was actually taken in November 2019, before the novel coronavirus became a global health threat. Fact Check:   Numerous Facebook users shared the photo of Biden speaking with Remi Yamamoto, his traveling national press secretary, in an attempt to suggest he flouted public health guidelines about wearing masks. Neither Biden nor Yamamoto are wearing a mask in the photo. One such post remarks, “Joe Biden doesn’t wear a mask on the plane, but he wears one outside… makes sense!” (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Propose Raising The Social Security Retirement Age To 75?) However, a reverse image search revealed the photo was taken before the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in China in late 2019. The photo was published on Vogue in October as part of a profile of Yamamoto with the caption: “Yamamoto and Biden huddle on a flight to South Carolina in November 2019.”  The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. appeared in January, ABC News reported, and the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommended Americans wear cloth face coverings in public as a measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus in early April, several months after the photograph of Biden and Yamamoto was taken. This isn’t the first time social media users have erroneously claimed a photo that predates the COVID-19 pandemic shows U.S. politicians flouting CDC mask guidelines. In October, Facebook users alleged a photo of Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Corey Booker and Sheldon Whitehouse depicted them doing so during Supreme Court Justice Amy Comey Barrett’s confirmation hearing, when the picture was actually taken in 2018.

Verdict: False The banner and podium have been digitally manipulated to make it seem like Biden was in Florida. Unaltered video from the event shows that Biden was in Minnesota and correctly greeted attendees.   Fact Check: Social media platforms have been replete with misinformation about politicians such as Biden in the lead up to Election Day. Over the weekend, social media users widely shared a video appearing to show Biden mistakenly saying “Hello, Minnesota” at a campaign stop in Tampa. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Joe Biden Waving At An Empty Field?) In the video, Biden takes the stage as music plays in the background. He then says, “Hello, Minnesota. Jessica, thank you for being here, for sharing your story.” Behind him, the banner appears to bear the words “Tampa, Florida,” while the podium in front of him seems to include the phrase “Text FL to 30330.”  However, the words on the banner and podium have been digitally altered to falsely suggest Biden forgot what state he was in. Videos from C-SPAN and Bloomberg News show that both actually had the words “Text MN to 30330” on them at the event, which was held on Oct. 30 in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the doctored video, “Tampa Bay, Florida” has been superimposed above “Battle for the Soul of the Nation” in the banner and “MN” has been changed to “FL” on the podium.  The altered video seems to have originated on Twitter, where one version received over one million views before it was labeled under Twitter’s “manipulated media” policy, according to CNN. The user who posted that version later deleted the tweet. Biden did campaign in the Tampa area Oct. 29, where he spoke at the Florida State Fairgrounds, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Video from Biden’s YouTube channel shows he used a different banner at the Tampa drive-in rally.

Mitt Romney’s son served on the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings’ board of directors with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.  Verdict: False There is no evidence Paul Pelosi Jr. or Mitt Romney’s sons served on Burisma’s board with Hunter Biden.   Fact Check: Hunter Biden served on Burisma’s board from April 2014 until early 2019, a move some perceived as a conflict of interest due to his father’s position as vice president, according to the Washington Post. The Facebook post attempts to link other prominent politicians’ sons to Burisma, claiming, “Paul Pelosi Jr., Nancy’s son & Mitt Romney’s son were on the Ukrainian gas company Burisma’s board along with Hunter Biden.” Pelosi has one son, Paul Pelosi Jr., while Romney has five sons – Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben and Craig, per Business Insider. There is, however, no evidence that any of them served as members of the Burisma’s board with Hunter Biden. No one by those names is currently listed as a member of Burisma’s board of directors on the company’s website.  Burisma has been the subject of considerable media attention in the past. Had Paul Pelosi Jr. or any of Mitt Romney’s sons held positions on the board, major media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet Check Your Fact didn’t find any. (RELATED: Did Clint Eastwood Say Joe Biden Is ‘Trying To Destroy Our Wonderful Country’?) Paul Pelosi Jr. did serve on the board of a hydrocarbon production technology company called Viscoil, which dissolved in 2010 before being folded into a Singapore-based company, according to PolitiFact. Nancy Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hammill, however, told the outlet that Viscoil didn’t have any dealings in Ukraine while Paul Pelosi Jr. worked for it.

Verdict: False The image depicts Joe Biden with Hunter Biden, one of Burisma’s board members and another man that works in finance. Burisma’s CEO is not pictured.   Fact Check: In recent days, social media users have been sharing an image of Joe and Hunter Biden on a golf course with two other men. “On 60 Minutes, Joe said he never met with Hunter and the Burisma CEO,” one such Facebook post reads. “Well, here he is with both… Lying POS!!!!” The New York Post on Oct. 14 published supposed content from a laptop that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani alleges belonged to Hunter Biden, according to USA Today. Biden recently sat down for an interview with “60 Minutes” journalist Norah O’Donnell, who asked about material from the laptop. Check Your Fact has not independently verified the alleged laptop’s material.  The image shows Joe and Hunter Biden with Devon Archer, who served on Burisma’s board with Hunter Biden, Fox News reported in September 2019. The other man pictured does not resemble Burisma CEO Taras Budeiniyi or founder Mykola Zlochevsky. PolitiFact identified the man as Ralph Rasucci of Netrex Capital Markets LLC. Joe Biden did not mention the Ukrainian energy company during the recent “60 Minutes” interview, a review of the transcript shows. The Daily Beast, however, did report in 2019 that Joe Biden previously said he had never spoken with the younger Biden about his overseas business dealings. Hunter Biden told The New Yorker the same year that they discussed Burisma just once. The claim may have originated in October 2019 when President Donald Trump tweeted that the image showed Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf with the “company boss.” (RELATED: Was Hunter Biden Paid As Much As $50,000 For His Work With Burisma?) “The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,” the tweet reads. “Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.” None of the men in the image are the CEO of Burisma, and Joe Biden did not mention Burisma in his recent “60 Minutes” interview. We rate this claim false.

Verdict: False While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted at least one way the CDC collects influenza data, the CDC has published reports and data for the 2020-2021 flu season.   Fact Check: Social media users are sharing a screen grab from the CDC website along with the claim that the agency “will not be providing data for the flu” in an attempt to baselessly suggest a “cover-up” to “show more covid cases.” Two sentences in the screen grab have been highlighted. “Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this system will suspend data collection for the 2020-21 influenza season,” reads the highlighted section. “Data from previous seasons are available on FluView Interactive.” (RELATED: Did Anthony Fauci Attribute 1918-1919 Spanish Flu Deaths To Face Masks In A 2009 Study?)  While screen grab and the two sentences on the CDC website are real, the information has been misinterpreted. The highlighted statement can be found on a section of the CDC’s website titled “Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States.” The page gives summaries of the eight data sources the CDC uses to survey influenza trends within the U.S. The highlighted note appears under the third data source – “Summary of the Geographic Spread of Influenza” – and indicates that this specific “system” will not collect data for the 2020-2012 influenza season. In previous flu seasons, state and territorial health departments would report the “estimated level of geographic spread of influenza activity in their jurisdictions each week through the State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report,” according to the CDC website. That “Summary of the Geographic Spread of Influenza,” however, is only one of eight data sources listed as being utilized by the CDC for flu surveillance. The CDC appears to still actively track and publish influenza data in the form of “FluView,” its weekly influenza surveillance report. For instance, the CDC has posted a report for the 2020-2021 flu season for the week ending Oct. 24. It notes that the “percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.2% this week.” FluView Interactive also shows data for the age group distribution of positive influenza specimens reported by public health laboratories through the week ending Oct. 24. Flu activity often starts to increase in October, typically peaking between December and February, though it can last as late as May, according to the CDC. The CDC website states that flu vaccinations “should be administered by the end of October” but “should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating locally.” The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.

Verdict: False The photo shows a screen grab of a video Harris posted on Twitter in November 2019 during a visit to Des Moines, Iowa. There is no evidence Harris was intoxicated in the video.   Fact Check: The image purports to show Harris intoxicated on Oct. 25 at an unnamed airport in Cleveland, Ohio, before boarding a flight to Oshkosh, a town in Wisconsin. “Throwing up in the bushes & staggering aimlessly at the Cleveland airport was the last straw before staffers put Kamala Harris back in the plane and took off for Oshkosh,” the caption reads. “Onlookers claim the clearly intoxicated Harris was confrontational but too weak to put up much of a fight.” It appears to be a screen grab taken at the roughly five-second mark of a video Harris posted to her personal Twitter account on Nov. 28, 2019. In the video, Harris greets several people while holding a basket before bending down to speak to a child. “Will you have a cookie?” she can be heard saying as she gives the boy a cookie from the basket.  Harris and her husband Douglas Emhoff traveled to Des Moines in November 2019 during the Democratic primary election campaign to celebrate Thanksgiving, according to the Des Moines Register. Harris attended the 2019 Turkey Trot in downtown Des Moines on Nov. 28 while her brother-in-law, Tony West, reportedly participated in the 5K run. Multiple people speaking to Harris in the video she uploaded to Twitter can be seen with “Turkey Trot” signs on their shirts, indicating that they were participants in the race. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Call American Churches ‘Propaganda Centers’?) She does not appear in the video to be “clearly intoxicated” or “confrontational,” as suggested by some Facebook users. Multiple images captured by Zuma Press photographer Jack Kurtz depict Harris meeting with Turkey Trot participants and none appear to show her intoxicated, “throwing up in the bushes” or “staggering aimlessly.” Check Your Fact didn’t find any local or national news outlets reporting that Harris was intoxicated at the Turkey Trot or on that day. Harris traveled to Michigan on Oct. 25 to make campaign stops in Detroit, Troy and Pontiac, local Fox affiliate WSMH reported. The previous day, she campaigned in Cleveland, per CNBC. Had the incident describes in the Facebook post occurred, it likely would have been noted in media reports, given the proximity of Election day.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsVarun HukeriGeneral Assignment & Analysis ReporterFollow Varun on Twitter","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3592390084139825&set=a.269767459735454&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3592390084139825&set=a.269767459735454&type=3&theater,https://www.ci.oshkosh.wi.us/,https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1200133507831472128,https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris,https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1200133507831472128,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/27/election-2020-booker-harris-visit-iowa-ahead-thanksgiving/4237272002/,https://secure.getmeregistered.com/get_information.php?event_id=132928,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/27/election-2020-booker-harris-visit-iowa-ahead-thanksgiving/4237272002/,https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1200133507831472128,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/10/13/fact-check-kamala-harris-american-churches-propaganda-centers/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3592390084139825&set=a.269767459735454&type=3&theater,https://www.alamy.com/des-moines-iowa-usa-28th-nov-2019-us-senator-kamala-harris-d-ca-carries-a-basket-of-cookies-while-she-walks-to-the-finish-area-of-the-turkey-trot-the-turkey-trot-is-an-annual-des-moines-thanksgiving-day-5-mile-fun-run-sen-harris-greeted-runners-in-the-finish-area-and-handed-out-cookies-she-is-running-to-be-the-democratic-nominee-for-the-us-presidency-in-2020-iowa-hosts-the-first-selection-event-of-the-presidential-election-season-the-iowa-caucuses-are-february-3-2020-credit-jack-kurtzzuma-wirealamy-live-news-image334253499.html,https://www.alamy.com/des-moines-iowa-usa-28th-nov-2019-us-senator-kamala-harris-d-ca-talks-to-a-person-in-a-turkey-outfit-in-the-finish-area-of-the-turkey-trot-the-turkey-trot-is-an-annual-des-moines-thanksgiving-day-5-mile-fun-run-sen-harris-greeted-runners-in-the-finish-area-and-handed-out-cookies-she-is-running-to-be-the-democratic-nominee-for-the-us-presidency-in-2020-iowa-hosts-the-first-selection-event-of-the-presidential-election-season-the-iowa-caucuses-are-february-3-2020-credit-jack-kurtzzuma-wirealamy-live-news-image334253118.html,https://www.alamy.com/des-moines-iowa-usa-28th-nov-2019-us-senator-kamala-harris-d-ca-waves-to-people-in-the-finish-area-of-the-turkey-trot-the-turkey-trot-is-an-annual-des-moines-thanksgiving-day-5-mile-fun-run-sen-harris-greeted-runners-in-the-finish-area-and-handed-out-cookies-she-is-running-to-be-the-democratic-nominee-for-the-us-presidency-in-2020-iowa-hosts-the-first-selection-event-of-the-presidential-election-season-the-iowa-caucuses-are-february-3-2020-credit-jack-kurtzzuma-wirealamy-live-news-image334252918.html,https://kurtzjack.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Campaign-2020-Kamala-Harris/G0000YQjLKDFwbQo/I0000V5nMVl7OuWU/C0000_Apaf_Tca3w,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/27/election-2020-booker-harris-visit-iowa-ahead-thanksgiving/4237272002/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-daily-trail-markers-thanksgiving-plans-for-the-candidates-some-are-staying-on-the-trail/,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/joe-biden-barack-obama-kamala-harris-work-in-concert-to-reach-crucial-voters.html,https://nbc25news.com/news/local/kamala-harris-to-campaign-in-michigan-on-sunday-oct-25,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/joe-biden-barack-obama-kamala-harris-work-in-concert-to-reach-crucial-voters.html,https://www.twitter.com/varunhukeri","No, This Image Does Not Show Kamala Harris ‘Clearly Intoxicated’",,,,,,
