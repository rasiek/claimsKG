And I want to see it before I leave to travel to move to Ghana because I’m going to do that.”When Winfrey asked Wonder if he planned to move permanently to Ghana, Wonder said he did. When she asked why, Wonder said it’s because he wants his descendants to live better lives, insinuating he wants them to escape the impacts of racism. He said, “Because I don’t want to see my children’s children’s children have to say, ‘Oh, please like me. Please respect me, please know that I am important, please value me.’ What kind of sh-t is that?”For its part, Ghana has been extending the welcome mat to Black Americans to relocate there for years — and in 2020 The Washington Post reported that many, exhausted by racist displays and violence in the United States, were accepting the invitation. But it’s not the first time the famous Motown singer has vowed to move to Ghana. When the story went viral in February 2021, Wonder’s hometown paper, the Detroit Free Press, reported that as far back as 1974, Wonder had voiced his intent to move permanently to Ghana.yearsreported","https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/the-oprah-conversation/episodes/,https://t.co/XLu7u3dvrc,https://twitter.com/MobilePunch/status/1362826948137861125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ghana-to-black-americans-come-home-well-help-you-build-a-life-here/2020/07/03/1b11a914-b4e3-11ea-9a1d-d3db1cbe07ce_story.html,https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2021/02/22/stevie-wonder-moving-ghana/4548325001/",Did Stevie Wonder Say He’s Moving to Ghana?,,,,,,

She advertised the alcohol-free, sugar-free lifestyle as “freewheeling” compared to liquid-only cleanses, allowing followers to eat things such as kimchi and kombucha.Additionally, the blog post marketed dietary supplements, nonalcoholic cocktails, skincare products, clothes, jewelry, and sessions in an infrared sauna — “all in service of healing” and giving “a gift to my body.”While the blog post only mentioned the coronavirus once (in the second paragraph), it implied that she supposedly bought or ingested the above-mentioned products to better manage the virus’ pervasive fatigue and “brain fog,” which is usually characterized by occasional forgetfulness or a lack of concentration.(About 10% of COVID-19 patients have similarly reported problems, including fatigue, depression, and an altered sense of taste and smell for weeks or months after their initial symptoms, according to the British Medical Journal.)British Medical JournalFollowing the publication of Paltrow’s blog, however, Stephen Powis, national medical director of National Health Service (NHS) England and a professor of renal medicine at University College London, warned fans of the beauty guru not to follow her advice.Stephen PowisHe told BBC:BBCIn the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid.

2,,,,Mixture,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pandemicide-trump-covid/,Is ‘Pandemicide’ a New Word Coined To Describe Trump’s COVID-19 Response?,,snopes,,"In February 2021, social media users shared an article published by Foreign Policy magazine in which the author, Laurie Garrett, accused former U.S. President Donald Trump of “pandemicide.”articleFor example, the article was shared by Trump’s estranged niece Mary Trump, a psychologist and outspoken critic of her uncle:Excellent, enraging, essential read from @Laurie_Garrett https://t.co/Ji55bRL7mD— Mary L Trump (@MaryLTrump) February 21, 2021Excellent, enraging, essential read from @Laurie_Garrett https://t.co/Ji55bRL7mD@Laurie_Garretthttps://t.co/Ji55bRL7mD— Mary L Trump (@MaryLTrump) February 21, 2021February 21, 2021Garrett’s piece prompted questions as to whether the term “pandemicide” in reference to mass death caused by presidential negligence during an infectious pandemic was a new one. Although Garrett didn’t invent the word, we couldn’t find references to it from earlier than the era of the Trump presidency.A Google search and search through newspaper archives didn’t show that the word “pandemicide” was used to describe any previous historical events. We also didn’t find the word currently listed in any dictionaries we consulted.But it has been used by at least four authors on three previous occasions, albeit relatively recent to the date of this writing.Garrett’s piece argues that Trump should be held accountable for what she called the crime of “pandemicide.” She defines it as the massive loss of life during Trump’s final weeks in office, when he was criticized for appearing to abandon presidential duties in favor of his quest to overturn the election win of his political rival, current U.S. President Joe Biden.abandonWhile Trump was president, approximately 400,000 people in the United States died from the coronavirus. The last 100,000 deaths occurred over the course of his final 36 days in office. Garrett wrote:occurredThere is vast evidence of Trump’s negligence during the pandemic’s third wave. Had I been a member of the House of Representatives during the body’s impeachment deliberations, I would have added to Trump’s indictment the crime of pandemicide, naming him as responsible for most of the COVID-19 deaths that transpired while he, the nation’s leader, was preoccupied with damning Joe Biden’s election victory. Trump’s failure to, as he vowed in his oath of office, “faithfully execute the office of president of the United States” promulgated a scale of lives lost exceeding anything experienced in the country since the Civil War, 160 years ago.There is vast evidence of Trump’s negligence during the pandemic’s third wave.

Van Belle and Thomas Jamieson (hailing from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and University of Nebraska, respectively) examined the effects of COVID-19 on the domestic populations of former imperial powers.observedacademic paperFriedman also noted that the word “pandemicide” doesn’t follow a traditional formula and instead follows a new composition “in which the front part of -icide compounds is the subject, not the object, of the killing.”The U.S. reported 500,000 COVID-19 deaths in late February 2021 — a figure The Associated Press described as “a staggering number that all but matches the number of Americans killed in World War II, Korea and Vietnam combined.”described","https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/18/trump-is-guilty-of-pandemicide/,https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/Ji55bRL7mD,https://twitter.com/MaryLTrump/status/1363592375474470915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ignores-duties/2020/11/12/02bfbc36-2507-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html,https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-deaths-2029a1c8-1e2f-42f0-bf49-b6c0c5dd1ff8.html,https://medium.com/transformations/pandemicide-full-text-67e64db9df41,https://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2021/02/word-of-the-week-pandemicide.html,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12854,https://apnews.com/article/us-over-500k-coronavirus-deaths-4ffa86c709f6a843de9cf0711e7215cf",Is ‘Pandemicide’ a New Word Coined To Describe Trump’s COVID-19 Response?,,,,,,
3,,,,Unproven,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-hillary-clinton-astronaut/,Did NASA Reject Hillary Clinton’s Childhood Dream of Becoming an Astronaut?,,snopes,,"An oft-repeated story by former U.S. Secretary of State, first lady, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is of the time when she wrote a letter to NASA as a child, expressing her dream of becoming an astronaut. NASA responded, she claimed, explaining they did not have any women astronauts. Clinton has repeated this many times over the years, with the details recounted largely the same.storyIn one speech, honoring Amelia Earhart in 2012, she said:speechNow some of you may know that when I was a little girl growing up in Illinois, I was interested in all kinds of stories about women. And my mother … was a real fan of Amelia Earhart’s, and actually told me about Amelia Earhart. And then when we decided, under President Kennedy’s leadership, that our nation was going to go to the moon and we were going to have an astronaut program, I wanted to be an astronaut. So when I was about 13, I wrote to NASA and asked what I needed to do to try to be an astronaut. And of course, there weren’t any women astronauts, and NASA wrote me back and said there would not be any women astronauts. And I was just crestfallen. But then I realized I couldn’t see very well, and I wasn’t all that athletic, so probably – (laughter) — I wouldn’t be the first woman astronaut anyway.Now some of you may know that when I was a little girl growing up in Illinois, I was interested in all kinds of stories about women.

But then I realized I couldn’t see very well, and I wasn’t all that athletic, so probably – (laughter) — I wouldn’t be the first woman astronaut anyway.The Washington Post investigated this story in 2015, reaching out to NASA and the Clinton campaign. Neither could reproduce the correspondence that Clinton described, given that the interaction took place around half a century ago.The Washington PostBut NASA did argue that such an interaction likely did take place, and they had no reason to doubt Clinton’s story. Agency officials said such a response was consistent with their policy at the time.argue“In 1962, the requirements for being an astronaut included being a military test pilot with a degree in engineering,” spokesperson Lauren Worley said. “More than 50 years later, NASA’s astronaut corps reflects our nation’s diversity.”NASA did not have a women’s astronaut program then. The first American woman who went to space was Sally Ride in 1983, while Susan Helms was the first woman crew member aboard the space station in 2001. The Washington Post did share an excerpt from NASA’s research about a failed private screening for women astronauts in the 1960s:firstThe Washington PostresearchDr. Randy Lovelace had been running (in 1960/61) a private screening program for potential women astronauts that was abruptly terminated in September 1961. That fall, there were many questions raised about why the program had been ended — with many fingers in the press and on Capitol Hill pointing at NASA. In the summer of 1962 there were congressional hearings on the topic.What had actually happened in September 1961 is that Dr. Lovelace had tried to run further tests on his women astronaut aspirants at Pensacola Naval Air Station. (It should be noted that most of the women weren’t completely aware the Dr. Lovelace had no official backing for this effort.) Before committing resources to these tests the U.S. Navy asked NASA if this was an official program. Surprised NASA officials said no, and the Navy refused to let Dr. Lovelace run the tests at Pensacola.In discussions between NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh Dryden and U.S. Navy officials that fall, Dryden’s position was that “NASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program” but that it might investigate the possibility “at some time in the future.” This was the official policy on women astronauts and NASA response letters to women throughout the 1960s reflect this perspective.Dr. Randy Lovelace had been running (in 1960/61) a private screening program for potential women astronauts that was abruptly terminated in September 1961.

One example was a letter found in Ride’s collection. It was sent to Ride by a woman named Linda Halpern who had written to NASA in 1962, and she received a response from the agency that said: “while many women are employed in other capacities in the space program — some of them in extremely important scientific posts — we have no present plans to employ women on space flights because of the degree of scientific and flight training, and the physical characteristics, which are required.”The Washington PostWe reached out to NASA and will update this story if more information becomes available.Although there is plenty of circumstantial evidence showing that it was likely that NASA sent Clinton such a response, there is no way to verify the actual correspondence decades later. We thus rate this claim as “Unproven.”","https://archive.li/BKmwi,https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/03/186072.htm,https://archive.li/BKmwi,https://archive.li/BKmwi,https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/whm-recent-female-astronauts,https://archive.li/BKmwi,https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/flats.html,https://archive.li/BKmwi",Did NASA Reject Hillary Clinton’s Childhood Dream of Becoming an Astronaut?,,,,,,

This is a computer generated image that was created by digital artist Robyn Silev. This image has been online since at least 2013 when it was posted to Silev’s page on Behance, a social media network used by artists to showcase their work. The original image featured a logo for “Newman’s Own Organic,” a food company that makes pet food in addition to salad dressings and cookies, and the slogan “They Once Ate Organic.” In a description of the photo, Silev explained that this advertisement “depict[ed] kittens as their wild relatives.” In other words, this is a picture of a kitten that was digitally enhanced to make it look more like a tiger:Behance,It’s unclear if this image was ever truly used in an official advertisement for Newman’s Own Organics cat food, or if this was simply an advertisement mock-up. We reached out to Silev for more information and we’ll update this article accordingly. While this is not a genuine photograph of a toyger kitten, toyger is truly a breed of domestic cat. According to the International Cat Association, Toyger cats were first bred in the 1980s by Judy Sugden and were first officially recognized as a championship breed of cat in 2007.breed of domestic catInternational Cat AssociationThe Toyger is being bred to resemble the tigers of the wild but in a package that fits easily into the modern urban lifestyle with the same nature as the domestic cat. The medium-sized cat has the rolling gait and vivid striped patterns of the wild cats without a single drop of real tiger blood. These miniature tigers are friendly outgoing cats that delight in being with their human companions. A young breed, the Toyger is in development as breeders work to replicate the pattern and colors of the tiger with ever-increasing accuracy. Tigers are an endangered species in the wild and many of the Toyger breeders are also very concerned about conserving the beautiful wild species that cats are created to resemble.People often refer to mackerel tabby cats as tigers or tiger stripes and yet their pattern is a far cry from the bold braided patterns of the real tiger. In the late 1980s, Judy Sugden was working to improve the clarity of the mackerel markings in these tiger cats. She noticed that her cat Millwood Sharp Shooter had two spots of tabby markings on the temple and realized that this could be a key to developing a cat with the true circular pattern on a tiger’s head. The temples of domestic tabbies do not usually have such markings on the head. Two cats that formed the cornerstone for the young Toyger breed were a striped domestic shorthair named Scrapmetal and a big-boned Bengal named Millwood Rumpled Spotskin. In 1993, Judy also imported Jammu Blu, a street cat from Kashmir, India, who had all spots between his ears rather than the regular tabby lines.The Toyger is being bred to resemble the tigers of the wild but in a package that fits easily into the modern urban lifestyle with the same nature as the domestic cat.

People should check with their doctor about wearing a mask if there’s a skin lesion on the face.”“There are certainly skin problems that can occur by wearing masks, but having a staph infection is a pretty rare occurrence and it usually involves multiple things for it to happen,” she explained.Kohli said that skin reactions can occur by wearing masks, mainly by wearing them for a long time, which can cause superficial abrasion or chafing of the skin. In the case of medical teams who wear N95 respirators for hours, the tightness of the mask can cause a bruise that the body absorbs naturally.“If you think about it, you’re putting more pressure on your face for several hours a day, the small blood vessels under the skin can get squeezed causing the bruise, but this is not a permanent damage as the body usually reabsorbs any internal skin blood after a while,” Dr. Kohli clarified.Dr. Kohli explained that Staphylococcus bacteria live in people’s nose and mouth, “it only enters our skin when there’s an open wound or cut.

Rand Paul of Kentucky continued to defend unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential elections, and often appeared mask-less during the COVID-19 pandemic, a meme spread about his past qualifications as an ophthalmologist.continuedmask-lessSnopes readers shared this with us and asked if the claims in it were true. We learned that in general they were, with some complicated elements.The text of the meme read as follows: Dr./Sen. Rand Paul claims to be a “board certified physician, but he isn’t certified by the respected, century old American Board of Ophthalmology. Instead he is “certified” by the National Board of Ophthalmology — which he founded. He is president, his wife is vice-president, and his father-in-law is secretary. The NBofO is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, the American Medical Association, nor the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure.Dr./Sen. Rand Paul claims to be a “board certified physician, but he isn’t certified by the respected, century old American Board of Ophthalmology. Instead he is “certified” by the National Board of Ophthalmology — which he founded. He is president, his wife is vice-president, and his father-in-law is secretary. The NBofO is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, the American Medical Association, nor the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure.Paul is a trained ophthalmologist who has been practicing since 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky. In 2010, reports emerged that Paul was not certified by a board for his specialty, at least according to the national clearinghouse for such certifications. As it turned out, Paul was board-certified initially by the American Board of Ophthalmologists (ABO) until 2005 and until 2011 by a board he founded himself in 1999, according to his own admission.reports1999admissionIn a 2010 statement to Politico, Paul described how his certification saga was his battle against a “hypocritical power play that I despise.” Paul basically protested against the ABO’s decision to require recertifications of medical licenses every 10 years for anyone who was board-certified after 1992. He fell in that group, found the decision to be “discriminatory,” and took it upon himself to set up the National Board of Ophthalmologists (NBO). Paul was board-certified for around 10 years by the ABO until letting it lapse in 2005. He said:statementprotested10 yearslapseI took the American Board of Ophthalmology (the largest governing body in ophthalmology) boards in 1995, passed them on my first attempt (as well as three times during residency), and was therefore board-certified under this organization for a decade.In 1997, I, along with 200 other young ophthalmologists formed the National Board of Ophthalmology to protest the American Board of Ophthalmology’s decision to grandfather in the older ophthalmologists and not require them to recertify.I thought this was hypocritical and unjust for the older ophthalmologists to exempt themselves from the recertification exam.In forming NBO, the younger ophthalmologists agreed to require recertification for all ophthalmologists.In my protest to the American Board, I asked, “If the ABO thinks that quality of care would be improved by board testing every decade, shouldn’t this apply to all doctors, not just those of a certain age? In fact, many of us argue that the older ophthalmologists need recertification even more since they are more distant from their training.[…]This is the kind of hypocritical power play that I despise and have always fought against.I took the American Board of Ophthalmology (the largest governing body in ophthalmology) boards in 1995, passed them on my first attempt (as well as three times during residency), and was therefore board-certified under this organization for a decade.In 1997, I, along with 200 other young ophthalmologists formed the National Board of Ophthalmology to protest the American Board of Ophthalmology’s decision to grandfather in the older ophthalmologists and not require them to recertify.I thought this was hypocritical and unjust for the older ophthalmologists to exempt themselves from the recertification exam.In forming NBO, the younger ophthalmologists agreed to require recertification for all ophthalmologists.In my protest to the American Board, I asked, “If the ABO thinks that quality of care would be improved by board testing every decade, shouldn’t this apply to all doctors, not just those of a certain age?

The organization lasted more than a decade, board-certified 50 to 60 doctors, and was never recognized by the medical establishment.Kentucky Secretary of State’s websitelastedrecognizedKentucky doesn’t require board certification for medical licensure, so Paul is still licensed to perform surgeries in the state, and he does. According to the American Medical Association, “While every physician must be licensed to practice medicine, board certification is a voluntary process. Medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients and is not specialty specific. Board certification, however, demonstrates a physician’s “exceptional expertise in a particular specialty and/or subspecialty of medical practice,” according to the American Board of Medical Specialties.”requireAmerican Medical AssociationIn 2013, The Washington Post asked Michael S. Rodman, executive director of the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, how the NBO fit into Kentucky law. “The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure does not license physicians based on their specialty board certification nor is it a requirement for licensure,” he said. However, the “Board does address specialty board certification through our regulation on physician advertising.” He confirmed that if a board is not on his group’s list, a physician cannot advertise as being board-certified. NBO was not on the list. Washington PostA TPMmuckraker investigation found that the NBO was not a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, an umbrella group for medical-specialty organizations, and officials for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery told the news organization they had never heard of the group. According to a 2010 report from the Courier-Journal (below), the NBO “is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, which works with the American Medical Association to approve such specialty boards.”TPMmuckrakerAccording to the Kentucky Secretary of State’s website, Paul’s family members did make up the NBO’s leadership. He was the president, his wife, Kelley Paul, was vice president and director, and Hilton Ashby, his father-in-law, was secretary. In 2010, TPMmuckraker reached out to Ashby to learn more about his involvement in the board, and he said, “I can’t tell you what the organization does.” When he was informed that he was listed as the group’s secretary, he said: “I was at one time involved as a secretary on something. But I don’t know whether it was about that specifically or not.” Paul’s wife also declined to comment for the Courier-Journal report, saying, “I’m not involved in that. I’m not officially talking about that today.” Neither of them are medical professionals.Kentucky Secretary of State’s websiteHilton AshbyTPMmuckrakerNeitherthemNBO’s board was dissolved by the state in 2000 after Paul missed a filing deadline, and though he kept it running, it remained legally unrecognized. He restarted the board officially in 2005 and filed annual reports until 2010, and the NBO was dissolved again by Kentucky in 2011. Its current standing is ranked as “Bad” on the Secretary of State’s site.dissolvedfileddissolvedIn 2013, The Washington Post wrote that Paul continued to present himself as “board-certified” even though the NBO had been out of business since 2011. His profile on the website of the Tri-Star Greenview Regional Hospital, said “Specialty Board Certifications: Ophthalmology” in 2013, though it appears to have been removed since then. And on the Healthgrades website, Paul’s physician entry once read “Ophthalmology, Board Certified,” though he does not appear to have an entry anymore. The same report said that Paul had not been certified by any board recognized by the state of Kentucky since 2005 and since 2011 had no board certification since his organization was dissolved. We have reached out to both the Tri-Star Greenview Regional Hospital, and Healthgrades, and will update this post if we receive more information. Paul has, however, tweeted about volunteering at the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Washington PosttweetedBased on his Senate website, Paul says he “currently performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world.” We have been unable to find recent examples of Paul presenting himself as “board-certified,” beyond the 2013 Washington Post report. Senate website2013We reached out to Paul’s office to get their response on the above reports and will update this piece if we receive more information. Given the public records describing the state of the NBO, Paul’s own statements, his board certification by the ABO until 2005, and the lack of information around how he presents himself today, we rate this claim as a “Mixture.”","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-rand-paul-continues-making-false-claims-2020/story?id=75446712,https://www.kctv5.com/why-wont-rand-paul-just-wear-a-mask/article_7df797dc-2033-567c-b260-d36f61c4a769.html,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Square-1.png,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rand-pauls-addresses-ophthalmology-certification-questions/,https://archive.li/9uZxI,https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2010/06/the-great-ophthalmological-war-of-1997-027555,https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2010/06/the-great-ophthalmological-war-of-1997-027555,https://archive.li/9uZxI,https://abop.org/verify-a-physician/?fn=rand&ln=paul#physician-list-search-results,https://archive.li/9uZxI,https://web.sos.ky.gov/ftshow/(S(gpnaxjyquwby5vp5mkhrzmtj))/default.aspx?path=ftsearch&id=0479924&ct=09&cs=99999&ce=UC8fVmjqpvl%2fZlduV5Sj1YIlTi2PIzxH8TkkDbNRB8EVcNanNsjY%2fyO9AZxknGyL,https://archive.li/Pscoc,https://archive.li/Pscoc,https://archive.li/Pscoc,https://www.ama-assn.org/residents-students/transition-practice/licensing-and-board-certification-what-residents-need-know,https://archive.li/9uZxI,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/rand-paul-s-upstart-ophthalmology-group-leaves-little-mark,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/clip_71948227.jpg,https://web.sos.ky.gov/ftshow/(S(gpnaxjyquwby5vp5mkhrzmtj))/default.aspx?path=ftsearch&id=0479924&ct=09&cs=99999&ce=UC8fVmjqpvl%2fZlduV5Sj1YIlTi2PIzxH8TkkDbNRB8EVcNanNsjY%2fyO9AZxknGyL,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-rand-paul-tried-to-lead-an-eye-doctors-rebellion/2015/02/01/010994da-9cd6-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/rand-paul-s-upstart-ophthalmology-group-leaves-little-mark,https://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/kelley-paul-leaves-gop-consulting-firm-094207,http://theloganjournal.com/Stories.aspx?Article=news515,https://archive.li/Pscoc,https://web.sos.ky.gov/ftshow/(S(gpnaxjyquwby5vp5mkhrzmtj))/default.aspx?path=ftsearch&id=0479924&ct=09&cs=99999&ce=UC8fVmjqpvl%2fZlduV5Sj1YIlTi2PIzxH8TkkDbNRB8EVcNanNsjY%2fyO9AZxknGyL,https://web.sos.ky.gov/corpscans/24/0479924-09-99999-20111101-ADS-4902880-PU.pdf,https://archive.li/9uZxI,https://www.wnky.com/sen-paul-out-of-quarantine-and-volunteering-at-tristar-greenview-regional-hospital/,https://www.paul.senate.gov/about-rand,https://archive.li/9uZxI",Was Rand Paul Certified as an Ophthalmologist by a Board He Created?,,,,,,
8,,,,False,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/joe-biden-n-word-recorded-speech/,Did Joe Biden Use the N-Word in a Recorded Speech?,,snopes,,"In late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.As part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration’s desire to be on good terms with the European Union.Approximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some posts accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.accidentallyintentionallyTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation — whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason — we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden’s speech.White House transcriptC-SPANConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:“Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.”While saying “I’m eager to hear,” Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant “mmmm” in the word “I’m” blended with the next word, “eager,” to make a “mnnm-eager” sound. That was the source of the social media posts’ allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker’s reason for saying it.A more plausible reason for the president’s phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.On several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in “repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound),” according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.discussed his strugglenon-profit National Stuttering AssociationIn other words, the claim is false — Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.The February 2021 posts were not the first to twist Biden’s words to accuse him of using the racial slur. During a 1985 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing — when the president was a senator representing Delaware — Biden read out loud portions of a memo by Louisiana legislators that included the N-word, and supporters of former President Donald Trump attempted to frame that moment of Biden reciting other people’s words as an example of his alleged racism.

11,,,,True,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nypd-fbi-malcolm-x-assassination/,"Did Former NYPD Officer Say Police, FBI Conspired In Assassination of Malcolm X?",,snopes,,"In February 2021, Snopes became aware of news reports and social media posts claiming a former New York Police Department (NYPD) officer authored a letter on his deathbed that served as evidence that the NYPD and FBI conspired in the 1965 murder of civil rights activist and sometime Nation of Islam figurehead Malcolm X.news reportsThe posts’ underlying claims were these: that a Black man named Raymond Wood wrote a letter shortly before his death that authentically outlined his experience working as an undercover NYPD officer in the mid-1960’s, when, he claimed, his supervisors ordered him to carry out a secret plan that led to the killing of the famed Black leader.To investigate the validity of those assertions, we first considered the known circumstances of Malcolm X’s death.He was fatally shot while speaking to a crowd at Harlem’s Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan on Feb. 21, 1965. Authorities immediately arrested one man, Mujahid Abdul Halim (or Talmadge Hayer), fleeing the ballroom with a clip from a handgun used in the assassination and later detained two men, Muhammad Abdul Aziz (or Norman 3x Butler) and Khalil Islam (or Thomas 15X Johnson). All suspects were members of the Nation of Islam, from which Malcom X separated shortly before the fatal shooting.Feb. 21, 1965During trial, Halim admitted his guilt, but said the other two suspects were innocent, The New York Times reported. Nonetheless, all three men were convicted in the killing and received life sentences. (Halim served 45 years in prison before he received parole in 2010; Islam, who received parole in 1987, died in 2009. Aziz, 83, received parole in 1985, per The Washington Post.)The New York Times reportedThe Washington PostFor decades, however, scholars and civil rights activists have long maintained authorities botched the murder investigation and imprisoned the wrong men. In 2020, following the release of the Netflix documentary series titled “Who Killed Malcolm X?”, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance launched a new probe to determine if, or to what extent, Islam and Aziz were innocent.civil rights activistsNext, we reviewed a video recording of a Feb. 20 press conference at which Malcolm X’s three daughters, along with civil rights attorney Ben Crump and Reggie Wood — a cousin of Raymond Wood — announced the existence of the alleged letter by the former NYPD officer and discussed its contents. Reggie Wood said at the press conference:video recordingBen CrumpIn 2011, Ray learned that he had stomach cancer and wasn’t sure how much longer he had to live. Shortly after, he confessed to me a series of detailed accounts of what he participated in, during his time as a police officer. At that time, Ray told me not to let him take this to his grave but to please wait until he passed away to come forward with this information. By 2012, his cancer had gone into remission, and he lived until Nov. 24, 2020.In 2011, Ray learned that he had stomach cancer and wasn’t sure how much longer he had to live. Shortly after, he confessed to me a series of detailed accounts of what he participated in, during his time as a police officer. At that time, Ray told me not to let him take this to his grave but to please wait until he passed away to come forward with this information. By 2012, his cancer had gone into remission, and he lived until Nov. 24, 2020.We confirmed Raymond Wood indeed served as a NYPD officer, working undercover to infiltrate Black civil rights groups in the 1960’s, based on news archives at the time.Additionally, based on Reggie Wood’s testimony and documentation displayed below, it was accurate to claim the former police officer wrote a letter shortly after receiving a cancer diagnosis in 2011 that detailed his experience on the police force.Raymond Wood lived another nine years, and the family kept the letter a secret throughout that time, according to the cousin. Then, after Raymond Wood’s death in fall 2020, the family felt comfortable discussing the contents of the letter and embarked on a process of corroborating its allegations.Lizzette Salado — who partnered with Reggie Wood, the cousin, to write a book titled “The Ray Wood Story: Confessions of a Black NYPD Cop in the Assassination of Malcolm X” — said they uncovered multiple sources to validate Raymond Wood’s account of working for NYPD in the 1960’s, though she did not provide specifics of that research process for Snopes to independently verify.bookWe obtained a digital copy of the letter, however. After reaching out to Crump’s office, which is representing several high-profile cases alleging wrongful use of force by police against Black Americans, a spokesperson for the attorney emailed us the below-displayed record, titled “confession doc.pdf,” signed by Raymond Woods and dated Jan. 25, 2011.several high-profile cases   In other words, Snopes confirmed the authenticity of a letter written by Raymond Wood that outlined his experience working as an undercover NYPD officer between 1964 and 1971, including the day of Malcolm X’s death.Without sharing specific names of former co-workers or supervisors, the letter claimed people in authority positions at NYPD coerced him into using his fake identity as a member of an unnamed Black civil rights group to coax two members of Malcolm X’s security detail into committing crimes that resulted in their arrests.As a result, when Malcolm X attended the planned event at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965, he did not have his usual entourage to protect him, under the pretenses outlined in the letter.“It was my assignment to draw the two men into a felonious federal crime so that they could be arrested by the FBI and kept away from managing Malcolm X’s door security on February 21, 1965,” Wood wrote. “At that time, I was not aware that Malcolm X was the target.”We reached out to the Manhattan District Attorney for its response to allegations of a conspiracy to cover up law enforcement’s involvement in Malcolm X’s death, as well as for information regarding its investigation into the convictions of Islam and Aziz.Danny Frost, a spokesperson, responded to our inquiry via email: “Our office’s review of this matter is active and ongoing.”Additionally, we contacted NYPD with similar questions. Sgt. Edward Riley, a spokesperson for the department, responded to us via email:Several months ago, the Manhattan District Attorney initiated a review of the investigation and prosecution that resulted in two convictions for the murder of Malcom X. The NYPD has provided all available records relevant to that case to the District Attorney. The Department remains committed to assist with that review in any way.Several months ago, the Manhattan District Attorney initiated a review of the investigation and prosecution that resulted in two convictions for the murder of Malcom X. The NYPD has provided all available records relevant to that case to the District Attorney. The Department remains committed to assist with that review in any way.Snopes also contacted the FBI, seeking its response to Wood’s accusations of an undercover operation by its agency and NYPD.A spokesperson directed us to a Feb. 22 statement by Assistant Director William F. Sweeney, Jr. in which he said the New York field office was aware of Raymond Wood’s letter, and that the agency was cooperating with the district attorney’s office in its probe to supposedly determine who, exactly, was involved in the high-profile killing.Feb. 22 statement“Today’s FBI stands for the noble pursuit of justice, and we will continue to support the (Manhattan District Attorney’s) review in any way we can,” Sweeney said.In sum, it is true a former NYPD officer authored a letter alleging a wide-ranging conspiracy by the FBI and police in the killing of Malcolm X, and that his family revealed the document to the public in February 2021. However, while no evidence exists to doubt the legitimacy of the letter’s claims, we could not independently verify the accuracy of its contents. With the exception of the letter and Reggie Wood’s testimony, no publicly-available proof exists to confirm NYPD leaders indeed forced Raymond Wood to coerce Malcolm X’s security detail into getting arrested.Let us note here: While Crump’s office responded to our request for documentation to confirm the legitimacy of the letter, they did not address our questions to help determine why, or under what circumstances, the attorney’s office agreed to help Reggie Wood publicly unveil the letter — or if, or to what extent, they were involved in the above-mentioned investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney. We will update this report when, or if, we receive those answers.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/02/22/malcolm-x-assassination-letter-nypd-fbi/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-24-at-1.45.02-PM.png,https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/malcolm-x-assassinated,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/nyregion/malcolm-x-assassination-case-reopened.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/02/22/malcolm-x-assassination-letter-nypd-fbi/,http://www.theragblog.com/books-tony-bouza-manning-marables-malcolm-x/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUSPNKuB5Qk,https://bencrump.com/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-24-at-12.21.51-PM.png,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WKMSPHK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ben-crump-attorney-floyd/2020/06/18/3e1007ba-af09-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html,https://twitter.com/NewYorkFBI/status/1363982478336266246,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-9.20.05-AM.png","Did Former NYPD Officer Say Police, FBI Conspired In Assassination of Malcolm X?",,,,,,
12,,,,Mixture,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coca-cola-training-less-white/,Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?,,snopes,,"In February 2021, several readers asked Snopes to examine the authenticity and accuracy of online posts which claimed that Coca-Cola had given its employees diversity training that included slides encouraging them to “try to be less white.”On Feb. 19, the Twitter account @LeftyMoment posted a widely shared tweet which contained the caption “This was in Coca-Cola’s diversity training” along with an image that appeared to be composed of two screenshots: one showing a presentation slide with the words “Try to be less white”; and the other with a list of “white” traits, explaining that “to be less white” means being “less oppressive,” “less arrogant,” “less certain” and so on:Those and other similar images appeared to have been leaked by a Coca-Cola employee to Karlyn Borysenko, a prominent online opponent of critical race theory and many aspects of corporate diversity training, who describes herself on LinkedIn as an organizational pyschologist and “executive/performance coach.”LinkedInBorysenko shared the screenshots on Feb. 19, consistently characterizing them as having been part of required training for Coca-Cola employees. As proof of this, she cited the Coca-Cola logo visible in the top right-hand corner of the screen.sharedThe screenshots were also shared on the controversial 4Chan thread /pol/, a frequent online source of political disinformation in recent years. Nigel Farage, former leader of the far-right UK Independence Party, mentioned the story in a YouTube video, saying Coca-Cola had “lost their marbles” by “putting their staff through compulsory training on ‘How to be less white.'”sharedoncontroversialmentionedThe presentation in question is real, and the “try to be less white” slides were authentic. However, the evidence presented by Borysenko and others does not prove that Coca-Cola included the presentation in its required diversity training for employees, and the company has explicitly denied that claim.AnalysisThe slides contained in the widely-shared online posts in February 2021 came from a presentation entitled “Confronting Racism,” which featured Robin DiAngelo, a writer and consultant whose work on racism has proven controversial and who has been hired to conduct diversity and anti-racism training for many American companies. workcontroversialThe course was created by Big Think, an educational video platform, using footage taken from an earlier interview they conducted with DiAngelo.“Confronting Racism” had been available on LinkedIn Learning, but was removed on Feb. 23, on foot of a request by the producers of the course Big Think, and representatives for DiAngelo. Before it was taken down, it carried the following description:availableIn this course, Robin DiAngelo, the best-selling author of White Fragility, gives you the vocabulary and practices you need to start confronting racism and unconscious bias at the individual level and throughout your organization. There’s no magic recipe for building an inclusive workplace. It’s a process that needs to involve people of color, and that needs to go on for as long as your company’s in business.

But with these tools at your disposal, you’ll be well on your way.White FragilityThe slides in question appeared during the “What you can do” section of the course:Those slides appeared as part of a video, which the screenshots shared widely in February 2021 did not fully reflect. In that section of the video, DiAngelo provides the following narration:I try to be a little less white. I’m really clear that I’m not going to be free of my conditioning and racism is not going to end in my lifetime. The question I ask myself is “How do I do a little less harm?” and “How do I know?” right? Am I, in any given moment, behaving in anti-racist ways? Not “I’m already done, I’m never racist.” Not “I’m a terrible person, I’m always racist.” In any given moment, how am I doing? And how do I know? And that keeps me humble, and it keeps me accountable.So for me, to do less harm is no small thing. Because it could literally be one more hour on a person of color’s life, who didn’t have to take home my nonsense and agonize all night long whether it was worth it to talk to me, or they should just suck it up yet again, lest they risk my lashing out in defensiveness. So for me to be “less white” is to be less oppressive, racially. To be less arrogant, to be less certain, to be less defensive, to be less ignorant, quite frankly. To be more humble, to listen, to believe, to break with apathy, to break with white solidarity. It’s not easy, it’s a lifelong process. But nothing is more rewarding. I try to be a little less white.

But nothing is more rewarding. LinkedIn Learning is a service provided to LinkedIn members with a paid “Premium” subscription. Users do not purchase individual videos, but rather their premium membership gives them access to all the additional content contained in the LinkedIn Learning platform: videos; courses; and “learning paths.” This is an important feature of LinkedIn Learning, in the context of the controversy prompted by Borysenko’s tweets and YouTube videos about Coca-Cola.allIn a news release published on Feb. 20, Coca-Cola stated that “Confronting Racism” “was not part of the company’s curriculum,” meaning it was not something Coca-Cola obliged its employees to view. Rather, the company said, its training involved use of LinkedIn Learning, and the course was accessible there.news releaseaccessibleaccessibleSo a company employee could log into a Coca-Cola LinkedIn account in order to watch videos that are part of their mandatory diversity training, but then navigate, within LinkedIn Learning, to “Confronting Racism,” which need not be required viewing in order for them to access it.This would allow them to create screenshots that feature slides from the course, alongside a Coca-Cola logo in the top right-hand corner. So, contrary to Borysenko’s claim, the presence of the logo was not proof that “Confronting Racism” was required viewing for company employees, merely that someone at Coca-Cola had viewed it.We asked Coca-Cola to provide details of the company’s “diversity, equity and inclusion training.” A company spokesperson did not provide a comprehensive curriculum, but did provide Snopes several examples of topics included as required viewing. Each of the following items appears to match individual videos available through the LinkedIn Learning platform: Fundamentals of an inclusive mindsetSix steps to inclusive conversationsWhat is unconscious bias? The impact of biasPractices and applications for brave allyship.Fundamentals of an inclusive mindsetFundamentalsSix steps to inclusive conversationsSix stepsWhat is unconscious bias? unconscious biasThe impact of biasimpactPractices and applications for brave allyship.brave allyshipThe spokesperson also provided further clarification about Coca-Cola’s use of LinkedIn Learning in company trainings:“On learning channels not owned by The Coca-Cola Company, users had the ability to navigate outside of the intended curriculum which may have given the false impression that certain videos were part of the training.”The controversy appears to have been caused by a fundamental misunderstanding, on the part of Borysenko and others, as to how LinkedIn Learning works, and the fact that Coca-Cola employees could, while taking part in their mandatory training, access hundreds of videos and courses that bore no relation to that training, and were not required.However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, despite Coca-Cola’s clear denials, the existence of a coherent alternative explanation, and despite the complete absence of evidence so far, “Confronting Racism” was in fact listed on the curriculum.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-19.png,https://archive.is/MjA1q,https://archive.is/CBuVA,https://archive.is/Q2Rmq,https://archive.is/2ORyp,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/08/how-conspiracy-theories-spread-online-its-not-just-algorithms/,https://youtu.be/mglYtZSRa8g?t=220,https://archive.is/zEwtn,https://archive.is/gwwvP,https://archive.is/NjqbD,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.23.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.00.png,https://archive.is/yXl95,https://archive.is/9plTQ,https://archive.is/md06w,https://archive.is/z5ljT,https://archive.is/LRlvS,https://archive.is/cxkVV",Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?,,,,,,

As of this writing, it doesn’t appear that this program was responsible for any arrests or deportations. ICE either “canceled” or “temporarily suspended” this program in early February as it awaited guidance from the Biden administration. The decision to “cancel” or “suspend” this program was made by ICE officials without input from the Biden administration. ICE still investigates sex crimes through its Homeland Security Investigations division. Operation Talon was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration. It’s unclear if this program was ever implemented.

At one point, the Post reported that it had examined emails from senior ICE officials and had learned that Operation Talon was in limbo as the agency waited for guidance from the new administration.Washington PostEmails among senior immigration officials show them eschewing most enforcement activity while waiting for more permanent guidance to be issued in the coming days.ICE officials also canceled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting sex offenders subject to deportation that had been planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, emails show.A senior ICE official said the Biden administration had nothing to do with that decision.

This estimation matches up with a news release published by ICE on Feb. 18, 2021, which stated that ICE had made an international organizational decision to place some temporary restrictions on their activities as they awaited guidance from the Biden administration.news releaseTim Perry, the Chief of Staff at ICE, said on a press call about the new guidelines:These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days. They’ll be superseded by guidance that is department-wide. The interim guidance that we’re putting out today apply to all ICE enforcement action such as arrests, detainers and custody decisions and the guidelines apply to removals as well.The purpose of the guidance is to empower ICE to allocate its resources in a way that best addresses the most pressing national security, border security and public safety threats. And in so doing it should better enable ICE to perform its mission. Something important that these guidelines do not do, they do not exempt any individual who is unlawfully in the United States from being subject to an enforcement action and they do not exempt anyone from removal from the United States if they are unlawfully in the United States.These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days.

The ICE website, for instance, still lists programs such as Operation SOAR (Sex Offender Alien Removal). Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, is also still capable of investigating and prosecuting sex crimes.Operation SOARDespite this, 18 state attorneys general penned a letter to the White House asking for this program to be reinstated. This letter cites a single source to support the claim that this program was “canceled” (the aforementioned article published in the Washington Post that quotes an official stating that program was likely “set aside”). Furthermore, this letter acknowledged that this decision was made by ICE and not the White House.penned a letterThe letter reads: “The undersigned Attorneys General of 18 States write to express our grave concern about the recent report that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has cancelled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting illegally present convicted sex offenders for removal from the United States.”We still have some unanswered questions about Operation Talon. For instance, we were unable to find any news releases from the White House or ICE from the Trump era that touted this new program. While the Post reports that this program was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, it’s unclear if this program was ever actually implemented. It’s also unclear if this program was “canceled” or if it is just temporarily on hold for review.What is clear is that this was an internal operational decision made by ICE, not the  Biden administration, and that the suspension of this program does not stop ICE from investigating sex crimes. Our investigation into this topic is ongoing.","https://archive.vn/FpWak,https://archive.vn/FpWak,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/facebook-operation-talon-conspiracy.jpg,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/new-biden-rules-for-ice-point-to-fewer-arrests-and-deportations-and-a-more-restrained-agency/2021/02/07/faccb854-68c6-11eb-bf81-c618c88ed605_story.html,https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-temporary-guidelines-its-enforcement-and-removal-operations,https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/fugitive-operations,http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/TDGT-BYCR6W/%24file/2021-02-18+Letter+re+Termination+of+Operation+Talon.pdf",Did Biden Cancel Operation Talon?,,,,,,

The following year, Hasbro introduced a Mrs. Potato Head version to the world.In February 2021, however, Hasbro’s Twitter account announced that the “iconic Mr. Potato Head [is getting] a 21st-century rebrand” and linked to a Fast Company article about the change that stated that the “Mr.” was being dropped from “Mr. Potato Head” so that the toy could “break away from traditional gender norms”:announcedarticleThe iconic Mr. Potato Head is breaking away from gender normsThe toy giant Hasbro is rebranding its iconic Mr. Potato Head toy by dropping the “Mr.” from the name. On the surface, it may seem like a subtle shift, but it is designed to break away from traditional gender norms, particularly when it comes to creating Potato Head families — how toddlers frequently play with the toy, according to Hasbro’s research. But starting this fall, when the new brand is unveiled, kids will have a blank slate to create same-sex families or single-parent families. It’s a prime example of the way heritage toy brands are evolving to stay relevant in the 21st century.This means the toys don’t impose a fixed notion of gender identity or expression, freeing kids to do whatever feels most natural to them: A girl potato might want to wear pants and a boy potato might wear earrings. Hasbro will also sell boxed sets that don’t present a normative family structure. This approach is clever because it allows kids to project their own ideas about gender, sexuality, and family onto the toy, without necessarily offending parents that have more conservative notions about family.The iconic Mr. Potato Head is breaking away from gender normsThe iconic Mr. Potato Head is breaking away from gender normsThe toy giant Hasbro is rebranding its iconic Mr. Potato Head toy by dropping the “Mr.” from the name.

One such condition that Rocha said could be responsible for the condition is synophthalmia, or partial cyclopia, which he believes to be real and exhibited in the photograph. twostudies“Scientists have been aware of these conditions for quite some time, what is different now is that photos that show it clearly are becoming viral because of the reach of social media.

And while it’s entirely possible that the fetal shark in question had experienced a deformation, it cannot be verified with certainty.“Just like any living thing, sharks can have malformations and mutations in their genetic code that are presented during development,” said Chapple. “Obviously in the wild most of these are not viable, which I’m guessing would have been the case with this animal, so we never see them unless they are caught in utero.”Identifying the shark is difficult without a dorsal view and further demographic information, including characteristics of the supposed mother. Indonesia’s Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries reported in 2020 that there are at least 117 species of sharks and rays found in the waters surrounding the southeastern Asian nation.reportedSharks reproduce through three main methods, according to the nonprofit conservation organization Shark Trust. Some sharks are known to lay eggs in what is known as oviparity, while others reproduce through ovoviparity, which is when the female carries the eggs inside of her. Once developed, ovoviparious eggs will hatch inside of the mother, who will then give birth to the young. Other sharks will give live birth through what is called viviparity. This is the most advanced form of reproduction and allows for the baby shark to develop within its mother’s body before being birthed.Shark TrustSo, while it is entirely possible that this photograph accurately depicts an unborn shark cut from its mother’s womb, Snopes was not able to independently verify its authenticity, and as such, we rate this claim as “Unproven.”","https://twitter.com/compostcIub/status/1364216753123917829,https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/1364480179465302019,https://nypost.com/2021/02/23/baby-shark-with-human-face-looks-like-youtube-character/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9290591/The-real-life-baby-shark-Mutant-fish-born-human-face.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline,https://t.co/H6gVZ3ZkLs,https://twitter.com/MailOnline/status/1364187713612693504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.viva.co.id/berita/nasional/1350645-ikan-hiu-mirip-wajah-manusia-ditemukan-di-rote?page=all&utm_medium=all-page,https://www.newsflare.com/video/412160/baby-shark-with-a-human-face-caught-in-indonesia,https://www.newsflare.com/,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/111013-shark-albino-one-eyed-fetus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24919845/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335832221_Abnormalities_in_two_shark_species_the_blue_shark_Prionace_glauca_and_the_school_shark_Galeorhinus_galeus_Elasmobranchii_Carcharhiniformes_from_the_Canary_Islands_eastern_tropical_Atlantic,http://www.fao.org/3/bt661e/bt661e.pdf,https://www.sharktrust.org/shark-reproduction",Is This an Authentic Photo of a Baby Shark With a ‘Human Face’?,,,,,,

The website Human Events, for example, wrote:circulatingwroteBiden cancels Trump’s ‘Operation Talon’ Program that Targeted Sex Offenders Living in U.S. IllegallyBiden has made it clear that his number one mission as president is to undo everything the Trump administration accomplished over the last four years.

Here’s what we’ve been able to find out.Operation Talon was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration. It’s unclear if this program was ever implemented. As of this writing, it doesn’t appear that this program was responsible for any arrests or deportations. ICE either “canceled” or “temporarily suspended” this program in early February as it awaited guidance from the Biden administration. The decision to “cancel” or “suspend” this program was made by ICE officials without input from the Biden administration. ICE still investigates sex crimes through its Homeland Security Investigations division. Operation Talon was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration. It’s unclear if this program was ever implemented.

At one point, the Post reported that it had examined emails from senior ICE officials and had learned that Operation Talon was in limbo as the agency waited for guidance from the new administration.Washington PostEmails among senior immigration officials show them eschewing most enforcement activity while waiting for more permanent guidance to be issued in the coming days.ICE officials also canceled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting sex offenders subject to deportation that had been planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, emails show.A senior ICE official said the Biden administration had nothing to do with that decision. Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, the official said they had not heard about the operation, but that it was possible that career staffers had planned it and set it aside while awaiting new instructions from the Biden team.The official noted that Homeland Security Investigations, a separate wing of ICE that conducts criminal investigations, has continued investigating sex offenses involving U.S. citizens and noncitizens.Emails among senior immigration officials show them eschewing most enforcement activity while waiting for more permanent guidance to be issued in the coming days.ICE officials also canceled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting sex offenders subject to deportation that had been planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, emails show.A senior ICE official said the Biden administration had nothing to do with that decision.

This estimation matches up with a news release published by ICE on Feb. 18, 2021, which stated that ICE had made an international organizational decision to place some temporary restrictions on their activities as they awaited guidance from the Biden administration.news releaseTim Perry, the Chief of Staff at ICE, said on a press call about the new guidelines:These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days. They’ll be superseded by guidance that is department-wide. The interim guidance that we’re putting out today apply to all ICE enforcement action such as arrests, detainers and custody decisions and the guidelines apply to removals as well.The purpose of the guidance is to empower ICE to allocate its resources in a way that best addresses the most pressing national security, border security and public safety threats. And in so doing it should better enable ICE to perform its mission. Something important that these guidelines do not do, they do not exempt any individual who is unlawfully in the United States from being subject to an enforcement action and they do not exempt anyone from removal from the United States if they are unlawfully in the United States.These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days.

The ICE website, for instance, still lists programs such as Operation SOAR (Sex Offender Alien Removal). Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, is also still capable of investigating and prosecuting sex crimes.Operation SOARDespite this, 18 state attorneys general penned a letter to the White House asking for this program to be reinstated. This letter cites a single source to support the claim that this program was “canceled” (the aforementioned article published in the Washington Post that quotes an official stating that program was likely “set aside”). Furthermore, this letter acknowledged that this decision was made by ICE and not the White House.penned a letterThe letter reads: “The undersigned Attorneys General of 18 States write to express our grave concern about the recent report that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has cancelled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting illegally present convicted sex offenders for removal from the United States.”We still have some unanswered questions about Operation Talon. For instance, we were unable to find any news releases from the White House or ICE from the Trump era that touted this new program. While the Post reports that this program was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, it’s unclear if this program was ever actually implemented. It’s also unclear if this program was “canceled” or if it is just temporarily on hold for review.What is clear is that this was an internal operational decision made by ICE, not the  Biden administration, and that the suspension of this program does not stop ICE from investigating sex crimes. Our investigation into this topic is ongoing.","https://archive.vn/FpWak,https://archive.vn/FpWak,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/facebook-operation-talon-conspiracy.jpg,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/new-biden-rules-for-ice-point-to-fewer-arrests-and-deportations-and-a-more-restrained-agency/2021/02/07/faccb854-68c6-11eb-bf81-c618c88ed605_story.html,https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-announces-temporary-guidelines-its-enforcement-and-removal-operations,https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/fugitive-operations,http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/TDGT-BYCR6W/%24file/2021-02-18+Letter+re+Termination+of+Operation+Talon.pdf",Did Biden Cancel Operation Talon?,,,,,,
23,,,,Outdated,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gabrielle-ludwig/,Do These Transphobic Posts Show a Transgender College Basketball Player?,,snopes,,"On Feb. 17, 2021, a “parody” page on Facebook shared years-old photographs of a transgender woman, Gabrielle Ludwig, who used to play on the women’s basketball team at Mission College in Santa Clara, California.sharedDespite how the profile appears, the Facebook page in question doesn’t belong to sports broadcaster Stephen A. Smith. The page labels itself a “parody” that is in “no way affiliated with” the real Smith. The post became a copyasta meme, meaning Facebook users forwarded it along by copying and pasting it from profile to profile. The text on the post read:copyastaHer name is Gabrielle Ludwig.Biologically a man, born Robert John Ludwig, ex-Navy sailor declared himself a woman in his 40 s. At 50 years old, measuring 6’ 8”, weighing 220 pounds and covered in naval tattoos, Gabrielle Ludwig caused a huge feeling when she made her college basketball debut for Santa Clara, California community college: playing in the women’s league.Her name is Gabrielle Ludwig.Biologically a man, born Robert John Ludwig, ex-Navy sailor declared himself a woman in his 40 s. At 50 years old, measuring 6’ 8”, weighing 220 pounds and covered in naval tattoos, Gabrielle Ludwig caused a huge feeling when she made her college basketball debut for Santa Clara, California community college: playing in the women’s league.The photographs of Ludwig are real, but what the rather dehumanizing text above doesn’t state is that they are outdated and out of context. Furthermore, the text of the post and the manner in which the photographs were shared appeared to play into yet another battle in the American culture war that uses the transgender community as a political wedge.political wedgeOne person who disparagingly shared photographs of Ludwig on Twitter wrote, “let’s not forget to thank #Biden for making this 100 times easier for men to achieve their college dreams.”sharedOur attempts to locate Ludwig for comment were unsuccessful, but we will update this story if we are able to reach her.The images of Ludwig were taken nearly a decade ago by photographer Martin E. Klimek for a USA Today story about her, published in 2012. In that story, and another published in 2013 by ESPN, Ludwig, a U.S. Navy and Desert Storm veteran, described her unique challenge of playing basketball for the community college’s women’s team. Not only was she the only transgender player, she was 50 when the USA Today story was published, making her the oldest player.USA Today storyESPNIn those stories, Ludwig recounted her long struggle with gender identity and how important playing team basketball was to her process, not just because she loved the sport and the camaraderie, but because it allowed her to fulfill a higher purpose. She told USA Today:If the example I can set for the kids who are transgenders in high school, for the people who hate transgender people and for those learning to deal with transgenders, transsexuals, if they see me as a normal person and we are not the bogeyman and love life and raise kids just like you,” Ludwig says, “maybe some of this mystery of who these people are will be taken away and there can be more blending into society. People are afraid of what they don’t know. I am willing to put myself out there. It was not like that before. It was just about playing basketball. It’s about more because I see an injustice.”If the example I can set for the kids who are transgenders in high school, for the people who hate transgender people and for those learning to deal with transgenders, transsexuals, if they see me as a normal person and we are not the bogeyman and love life and raise kids just like you,” Ludwig says, “maybe some of this mystery of who these people are will be taken away and there can be more blending into society. People are afraid of what they don’t know. I am willing to put myself out there. It was not like that before. It was just about playing basketball. It’s about more because I see an injustice.”The USA Today story carries an editor’s note that it was updated in February 2021 to conform to the publication’s current editorial style.editorial styleLudwig also described how people would react to her presence at games, which was sometimes hostile and uncomfortable, including a man who verbally accosted her coach for allowing her to play, and “the gawking, the whispers and the female referee in Barstow who looked [Ludwig] in the eye and refused to shake her hand.”In terms of whether being transgender gave her an unfair advantage over the other women players, Ludwig told ESPN the only natural advantage she had was her height, standing at 6 feet, 6 inches. Otherwise, she noted that taking female hormones reduced her muscle mass. At the time the ESPN story was published, Ludwig was 52, meaning she had to work harder than the younger players to get into physical shape.A spokesperson for Mission told us Ludwig played there in 2012 and 2013. She then served as an assistant coach at Mission for several years before moving on, and is no longer associated with the college or the team.This isn’t the first time internet trolls have used social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to nonsensically bully transgender people. In January 2021, trolls shared an image of a person wearing a baby doll-style dress and claimed without evidence that the image depicted Dr. Rachel Levine, U.S. President Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as assistant health secretary.without evidence","https://archive.is/iikBl,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Horizontal-3.jpg,https://www.snopes.com/collections/copypasta/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/targets-stock-transgender-bathroom-policy/,https://archive.is/l4Xat,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2012/12/04/college-basketball-transgender-player-gabrielle-ludwig-robert-ludwig-mission-college/1744703/,https://www.espn.com/espnw/athletes-life/story/_/id/10170842/espnw-gabrielle-ludwig-52-year-old-transgender-women-college-basketball-player-enjoying-best-year-life,https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rachel-levine-photo/",Do These Transphobic Posts Show a Transgender College Basketball Player?,,,,,,

25,,,,False,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/merrick-garland-bill-barr-liar/,Did Merrick Garland Call Bill Barr a ‘Liar’ During Confirmation Hearing?,,snopes,,"In February 2021, during U.S. Senate hearings on the confirmation of Merrick Garland as President Joe Biden’s nominee for attorney general, a widely shared tweet purported to capture a startlingly frank exchange between Garland and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.The tweet, posted by @Roshan_Rinaldi on Feb. 22, contained a link to a PBS live video of the hearing, along with the following text:tweetTom Cotton: “Can you make a commitment on resources?”Garland: “I don’t make commitments unless I know the facts first.”Cotton: “When we confirmed Bill Barr, he was able to make a commitment on resources. Why can’t you do that now?”Garland: “Because I’m not a liar”Tom Cotton: “Can you make a commitment on resources?”Garland: “I don’t make commitments unless I know the facts first.”Cotton: “When we confirmed Bill Barr, he was able to make a commitment on resources. Why can’t you do that now?”Garland: “Because I’m not a liar”The tweet, which has since been deleted, was widely shared on Twitter and its text contents tweeted out by several users in separate tweets. It was also shared on the popular left-wing forum Democratic Underground. On Facebook, users enthusiastically shared screenshots of it in the hours and days that followed. The following screenshot demonstrates the popularity of the post on Facebook in February 2021:several userssharedsharedIn reality, Garland never called former Attorney General Bill Barr “a liar.” Nor did he describe him in a way that could fairly be summarized in that way. The tweet paraphrased a real line of questioning from Cotton but grossly misrepresented both the wording and tone of Garland’s response.@Roshan_Rinaldi’s tweet was particularly misleading because it not only misrepresented Garland’s utterances in response to Cotton’s questioning, but also used quotation marks, thereby presenting the exchange between Cotton and Garland as a direct quotation, which it certainly was not.AnalysisDuring a confirmation hearing on Feb. 22, Garland, a U.S. Circuit Court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, faced questioning from Republican senators about the future of Special Counsel John Durham‘s investigation. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump asked Durham to investigate whether federal investigators engaged in wrongdoing or criminality during the early stages of investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government actors during the 2016 presidential election. In 2020, Trump gave Durham the title and powers of a special counsel. John Durhamspecial counselIn particular, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and later Cotton, asked Garland whether he would commit to providing Durham the resources he required in order to complete his investigation. Garland demurred, and both Grassley and Cotton pointed out (accurately) that Barr, during his confirmation hearings in January 2019, was willing to make such a commitment to continuing and resourcing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign.accuratelyIn order to provide the full and proper account of what Garland actually said about Barr (or rather, did not say), the following are excerpted transcripts and videos of his exchanges with Grassley and then Cotton:Grassley: I’m going to go to the Durham investigation. At Barr’s hearing, he stated the following [with] regard to Mueller’s investigation: “It’s virtually [read: vitally] important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation.” Also, at that same hearing, Sen. Feinstein asked: “Will you commit to providing Mr. Mueller with the resources, funds and time needed to complete his investigation?” Attorney General Barr answered Sen. Feinstein with a one-word “Yes.” With respect to Special Counsel Durham’s investigation, I expect that he will be allowed to complete his investigation. If confirmed, will you commit to providing Special Counsel Durham with the staff, resources, funds and time needed to thoroughly complete the investigation?Garland: Senator, I don’t have any information about the investigation, as I sit here today. And another one of the very first things I’m going to have to do is speak with Mr. Durham, figure out how his investigation is going. I understand that he has been permitted to remain in his position, and sitting here today, I have no reason to think that that was not the correct decision. Grassley: Okay. And I suppose that would be an answer that [means] he would only be removed for cause, then? Would that be your position?Garland: Well, Senator, I really do have to have an opportunity to talk with him. I have not had that opportunity. As I said, I don’t have any reason, from what I know now, which is really very little, to make any determination on that ground. But I don’t have any reason to think that he should not remain in place. Grassley: I’m going to go to the Durham investigation.

Grassley’s questions about the Durham investigation. Sen. Grassley asked you if you would commit, specifically, to ensure that John Durham had the staff, the resources and the time that he needed to complete that investigation. You said you didn’t have the info yet, that you needed to speak to him, but you had no reason to think that him staying on was not the correct decision —Garland: That’s correct, Sir, yes.Cotton: Why can’t you commit, specifically, to saying that he will have the time, staff and resources he needs to complete his investigation?Garland: Well, again, it’s because I’m sitting here and I don’t have any information about what he needs, in his resources and the allocation of resources. But my — everything I know, sitting here, suggests that he should of course have those resources.Cotton: Judge, two years ago Bill Barr made that exact commitment about the Mueller special counsel [investigation]. He did not have that information, he had not consulted with the department. He was in the same posture you are. He simply said “Yes.” Why can’t you say “Yes” today, the way Bill Barr did two years ago?Garland: Again, my view about every investigation and every decision I make is I have to know the facts before I can make those kind of decisions. I don’t know what went into his consideration, but for myself, I have to be there and learn what’s going on, before I can make a decision. But as I said, I have no reason to doubt that the decision to keep him in place, and to continue his investigation, was in any way wrong.Cotton: Was it wrong for Bill Barr to make that commitment two years ago?Garland: Again, as I said, Senator, I’m not going to be making judgements about my predecessors. I don’t think there’s any purpose in that for myself. I want you to judge me on my own record and what I do going forward.Cotton: Was it wrong for Democratic senators on this committee to repeatedly demand that Bill Barr make that commitment two years ago?Garland: I think my answer would be the same.Cotton: I want to return to Sen. Grassley’s questions about the Durham investigation. Sen. Grassley asked you if you would commit, specifically, to ensure that John Durham had the staff, the resources and the time that he needed to complete that investigation.

29,,,,Mixture,,,,snopes,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coca-cola-training-less-white/,Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?,,snopes,,"In February 2021, several readers asked Snopes to examine the authenticity and accuracy of online posts which claimed that Coca-Cola had given its employees diversity training that included slides encouraging them to “try to be less white.”On Feb. 19, the Twitter account @LeftyMoment posted a widely shared tweet which contained the caption “This was in Coca-Cola’s diversity training” along with an image that appeared to be composed of two screenshots: one showing a presentation slide with the words “Try to be less white”; and the other with a list of “white” traits, explaining that “to be less white” means being “less oppressive,” “less arrogant,” “less certain” and so on:Those and other similar images appeared to have been leaked by a Coca-Cola employee to Karlyn Borysenko, a prominent online opponent of critical race theory and many aspects of corporate diversity training, who describes herself on LinkedIn as an organizational pyschologist and “executive/performance coach.”LinkedInBorysenko shared the screenshots on Feb. 19, consistently characterizing them as having been part of required training for Coca-Cola employees. As proof of this, she cited the Coca-Cola logo visible in the top right-hand corner of the screen.sharedThe screenshots were also shared on the controversial 4Chan thread /pol/, a frequent online source of political disinformation in recent years. Nigel Farage, former leader of the far-right UK Independence Party, mentioned the story in a YouTube video, saying Coca-Cola had “lost their marbles” by “putting their staff through compulsory training on ‘How to be less white.'”sharedoncontroversialmentionedThe presentation in question is real, and the “try to be less white” slides were authentic. However, the evidence presented by Borysenko and others does not prove that Coca-Cola included the presentation in its required diversity training for employees, and the company has explicitly denied that claim.AnalysisThe slides contained in the widely-shared online posts in February 2021 came from a presentation entitled “Confronting Racism,” which featured Robin DiAngelo, a writer and consultant whose work on racism has proven controversial and who has been hired to conduct diversity and anti-racism training for many American companies. workcontroversialThe course was created by Big Think, an educational video platform, using footage taken from an earlier interview they conducted with DiAngelo.“Confronting Racism” had been available on LinkedIn Learning, but was removed on Feb. 23, on foot of a request by the producers of the course Big Think, and representatives for DiAngelo. Before it was taken down, it carried the following description:availableIn this course, Robin DiAngelo, the best-selling author of White Fragility, gives you the vocabulary and practices you need to start confronting racism and unconscious bias at the individual level and throughout your organization. There’s no magic recipe for building an inclusive workplace. It’s a process that needs to involve people of color, and that needs to go on for as long as your company’s in business.

But with these tools at your disposal, you’ll be well on your way.White FragilityThe slides in question appeared during the “What you can do” section of the course:Those slides appeared as part of a video, which the screenshots shared widely in February 2021 did not fully reflect. In that section of the video, DiAngelo provides the following narration:I try to be a little less white. I’m really clear that I’m not going to be free of my conditioning and racism is not going to end in my lifetime. The question I ask myself is “How do I do a little less harm?” and “How do I know?” right? Am I, in any given moment, behaving in anti-racist ways? Not “I’m already done, I’m never racist.” Not “I’m a terrible person, I’m always racist.” In any given moment, how am I doing? And how do I know? And that keeps me humble, and it keeps me accountable.So for me, to do less harm is no small thing. Because it could literally be one more hour on a person of color’s life, who didn’t have to take home my nonsense and agonize all night long whether it was worth it to talk to me, or they should just suck it up yet again, lest they risk my lashing out in defensiveness. So for me to be “less white” is to be less oppressive, racially. To be less arrogant, to be less certain, to be less defensive, to be less ignorant, quite frankly. To be more humble, to listen, to believe, to break with apathy, to break with white solidarity. It’s not easy, it’s a lifelong process. But nothing is more rewarding. I try to be a little less white.

But nothing is more rewarding. LinkedIn Learning is a service provided to LinkedIn members with a paid “Premium” subscription. Users do not purchase individual videos, but rather their premium membership gives them access to all the additional content contained in the LinkedIn Learning platform: videos; courses; and “learning paths.” This is an important feature of LinkedIn Learning, in the context of the controversy prompted by Borysenko’s tweets and YouTube videos about Coca-Cola.allIn a news release published on Feb. 20, Coca-Cola stated that “Confronting Racism” “was not part of the company’s curriculum,” meaning it was not something Coca-Cola obliged its employees to view. Rather, the company said, its training involved use of LinkedIn Learning, and the course was accessible there.news releaseaccessibleaccessibleSo a company employee could log into a Coca-Cola LinkedIn account in order to watch videos that are part of their mandatory diversity training, but then navigate, within LinkedIn Learning, to “Confronting Racism,” which need not be required viewing in order for them to access it.This would allow them to create screenshots that feature slides from the course, alongside a Coca-Cola logo in the top right-hand corner. So, contrary to Borysenko’s claim, the presence of the logo was not proof that “Confronting Racism” was required viewing for company employees, merely that someone at Coca-Cola had viewed it.We asked Coca-Cola to provide details of the company’s “diversity, equity and inclusion training.” A company spokesperson did not provide a comprehensive curriculum, but did provide Snopes several examples of topics included as required viewing. Each of the following items appears to match individual videos available through the LinkedIn Learning platform: Fundamentals of an inclusive mindsetSix steps to inclusive conversationsWhat is unconscious bias? The impact of biasPractices and applications for brave allyship.Fundamentals of an inclusive mindsetFundamentalsSix steps to inclusive conversationsSix stepsWhat is unconscious bias? unconscious biasThe impact of biasimpactPractices and applications for brave allyship.brave allyshipThe spokesperson also provided further clarification about Coca-Cola’s use of LinkedIn Learning in company trainings:“On learning channels not owned by The Coca-Cola Company, users had the ability to navigate outside of the intended curriculum which may have given the false impression that certain videos were part of the training.”The controversy appears to have been caused by a fundamental misunderstanding, on the part of Borysenko and others, as to how LinkedIn Learning works, and the fact that Coca-Cola employees could, while taking part in their mandatory training, access hundreds of videos and courses that bore no relation to that training, and were not required.However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, despite Coca-Cola’s clear denials, the existence of a coherent alternative explanation, and despite the complete absence of evidence so far, “Confronting Racism” was in fact listed on the curriculum.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-19.png,https://archive.is/MjA1q,https://archive.is/CBuVA,https://archive.is/Q2Rmq,https://archive.is/2ORyp,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/08/how-conspiracy-theories-spread-online-its-not-just-algorithms/,https://youtu.be/mglYtZSRa8g?t=220,https://archive.is/zEwtn,https://archive.is/gwwvP,https://archive.is/NjqbD,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.23.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.00.png,https://archive.is/yXl95,https://archive.is/9plTQ,https://archive.is/md06w,https://archive.is/z5ljT,https://archive.is/LRlvS,https://archive.is/cxkVV",Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?,,,,,,

This estimation matches up with a news release published by ICE on Feb. 18, 2021, which stated that ICE had made an international organizational decision to place some temporary restrictions on their activities as they awaited guidance from the Biden administration.news releaseTim Perry, the Chief of Staff at ICE, said on a press call about the new guidelines:These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days. They’ll be superseded by guidance that is department-wide. The interim guidance that we’re putting out today apply to all ICE enforcement action such as arrests, detainers and custody decisions and the guidelines apply to removals as well.The purpose of the guidance is to empower ICE to allocate its resources in a way that best addresses the most pressing national security, border security and public safety threats. And in so doing it should better enable ICE to perform its mission. Something important that these guidelines do not do, they do not exempt any individual who is unlawfully in the United States from being subject to an enforcement action and they do not exempt anyone from removal from the United States if they are unlawfully in the United States.These are interim guidelines which will be in place until they’re superseded which we anticipate will be in approximately 90 days.

The ICE website, for instance, still lists programs such as Operation SOAR (Sex Offender Alien Removal). Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, is also still capable of investigating and prosecuting sex crimes.Operation SOARDespite this, 18 state attorneys general penned a letter to the White House asking for this program to be reinstated. This letter cites a single source to support the claim that this program was “canceled” (the aforementioned article published in the Washington Post that quotes an official stating that program was likely “set aside”). Furthermore, this letter acknowledged that this decision was made by ICE and not the White House.penned a letterThe letter reads: “The undersigned Attorneys General of 18 States write to express our grave concern about the recent report that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has cancelled Operation Talon, a nationwide operation targeting illegally present convicted sex offenders for removal from the United States.”We still have some unanswered questions about Operation Talon. For instance, we were unable to find any news releases from the White House or ICE from the Trump era that touted this new program. While the Post reports that this program was planned in the final weeks of the Trump administration, it’s unclear if this program was ever actually implemented. It’s also unclear if this program was “canceled” or if it is just temporarily on hold for review.What is clear is that this was an internal operational decision made by ICE, not the  Biden administration, and that the suspension of this program does not stop ICE from investigating sex crimes.
