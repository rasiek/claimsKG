So there is a net benefit I think for Australia in taking that approach and acting.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Thistlethwaite’s statement that modelling showed adopting a net zero target will create 250,000 jobs in Australia over the next decade.His office said the statement was based on a Deloitte Access Economics report from November 2020. The report included modelling on the economic effects of “unchecked” climate change and an alternate scenario of the globe reaching net zero emissions by 2050.It said that a “new growth recovery” post-COVID-19 – including limiting global warming to 1.5C and moving to net zero emissions worldwide – would add over 250,000 jobs by 2070 (page 6) compared to a scenario in which climate change was unchecked.The job gains would not come within a decade, as Mr Thistlethwaite claimed, nor was the prediction based on the effects of Australia adopting the net zero target. Rather, it relied on global action to reach that goal.The report also predicted there would be net job losses under the same “new growth recovery” scenario until at least the year 2050, when there would still be 22,000 fewer jobs (table A.5 and chart A.4, pages 69-70).The jobs that were added would partially be created by investment in renewable energy and other efforts to mitigate climate change (page 46). It said the modelling was also based on there being a global increase in productivity in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Recovery Plan (page 66).The IEA plan, produced in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, sets out policies to boost economic growth by reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of government stimulus to recover from the COVID-19-induced recession (page 13). It said this would cost about US$3 trillion and create nine million jobs a year over three years (page 14).The Deloitte report predicted that if there was no global action on climate change and the earth warmed 3C by 2070 then 880,000 jobs would be lost in Australia (page 5) compared to a scenario in which there were no climate change effects.The figure was based on modelling the “physical damages” from climate change and their impact on productivity (page 59). These damages included climate change’s impact on capital, land, agriculture, tourism, health, energy demand and labour productivity.Deloitte Access Economics associate director Claire Atkinson said Mr Thistlethwaite’s interpretation would have been “broadly correct” if he had accurately quoted a 2070 date for the 250,000 jobs gained.However, University of Melbourne Richie chair of economics John Freebairn, one of Australia’s top economists, said the assumptions used in the modelling, including that the world would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, were “unlikely”.Prof Freebairn said reducing emissions and adapting to climate change would create and destroy jobs in various industries, and models based on alternate assumptions would reach different conclusions as there were many unknown parameters, such as the prevailing conditions in the global economy.He said efforts to reduce emissions were generally more costly than a business-as-usual scenario, “otherwise the less polluting options would have been adopted”. But this had to be weighed against the cost of climate change.“In aggregate, mitigation decisions that are more costly and less productive for the private sector decision-makers would reduce employment. These costs of mitigation have to be compared with the benefits of less climate change.”Prof Freebairn noted that Australia accounted for just over one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which meant the country achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in isolation would have a negligible impact on the effects of climate change and lead to a net loss of employment.But he agreed worldwide action to reduce emissions and alleviate the impact of climate change would reduce the cost of climate change adaptation and boost employment and productivity.University of Canberra economics professor and director of the Centre for Labour Market Research Phil Lewis also said different assumptions on the impacts of climate change could produce contrasting results for its effect on the jobs market.“For instance, a major driver of the (Deloitte) model is the extent to which rising temperature reduces productivity such as through land degradation and employees getting too hot and reducing their effort,” he said.“There is no allowance for changes in technology, such as those that have taken place throughout history, in improving productivity of the land base or through air conditioning and improving building standards.”University of Queensland economics professor John Quiggin, who specialises in environmental economics, said climate change would harm the economy and reduce employment, but in the long run the main impact would likely be lower wages rather than job losses.However, he said shifting to renewable energy would employ more people as renewables were more employment-intensive over a full life cycle than fossil fuel generation.Prof Quiggin referred to a report published in November 2020 by Climate Action Tracker, a research consortium partly funded by the German Ministry for the Environment, which said accelerating the transition to renewable energy would create 46,000 jobs in Australia between 2021 and 2030 (page 3).The figure took into account job losses in industries linked to fossil fuel power generation (Figure 14, page 26). With policies to incentivise local manufacturing of components like solar panels and batteries, the number of jobs created could increase to 75,000.Other analysis into the impact on employment of reaching net zero emissions has led to a range of conclusions.A January report from conservative think-tank the Institute of Public Affairs said Australia targeting net zero emissions by 2050 would put 653,000 jobs “at risk” (page 4). It said this was calculated by adding together all positions in industries where the emissions per job were above average.It did not go into any further detail about what proportion of jobs in industries emissions-intensive industries would be lost, or over what time-frame, however it claimed the jobs created by a net zero target would not outweigh the job losses it caused (page 8).As evidence for this, the report said between 2009-10 and 2018-19 the number of people employed in “renewable activities” increased by 14,700, while the number of people employed in manufacturing declined by 76,200 (page 9). However, the report did not specify how the job losses in manufacturing were linked to renewable energy or emissions reductions.A report by the Beyond Zero Emissions think tank, which has a stated purpose of showing “how Australia can prosper in a zero-emissions economy”, said that if the government focused on encouraging low-carbon technology as part of a COVID-19 recovery plan it could create over 200,000 ongoing jobs within five years in sectors including renewable energy, buildings, transport and manufacturing (page 9).A report on the modelling used in the plan said it was based on the unemployment rate not returning to seven per cent until 2023 (page i) due to the pandemic, however the latest unemployment figures show the unemployment rate had already declined to 6.4 per cent in January.The job creation also relied on a significant increase in spending, including $35 billion to make buildings more energy efficient and $1.7 billion in government funding to upgrade the electricity transmission network (page v). A Deloitte report says unchecked climate change would cost Australia 880,000 jobs.","https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6230271483001,https://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/kingsford-smith.htm,https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/economics/articles/new-choice-climate-growth.html,https://www.iea.org/about,https://www.iea.org/reports/sustainable-recovery,https://www.iea.org/reports/sustainable-recovery,https://www.imf.org/en/About,https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/profiles/claire-atkinson.html,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14508-john-w-freebairn,https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/professor-john-freebairn-awarded-ao-for-achievements-in-economics,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-share-of-co2-emissions?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&country=~AUS&region=World,https://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/faculties/busgovlaw/school-of-government-and-policy/prof-phil-lewis,https://economics.uq.edu.au/profile/2249/john-quiggin,https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/806/CAT_2020-11-10_ScalingUp_AUSTRALIA_FullReport.pdf,https://climateactiontracker.org/about/,https://www.bmu.de/en/,https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2021-02/apo-nid310893.pdf,https://ipa.org.au/about-us,https://bze.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BZE-The-Million-Jobs-Plan-Full-Report-2020.pdf,https://bze.org.au/about-us/,https://bze.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Million-Jobs-Plan-Economics-Summary.pdf,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release","Will cutting emissions create 250,000 jobs in a decade?",,,,,,

He is not getting the vaccine in this picture. The nurse is using a 25 gauge, 1 ml subcutaneous insulin syringe … For any intramuscular injections a 23-21 gauge needle – 3ml syringe combo is used. With a green or blue cap not orange … the joy of being a nurse! you don’t even have to SMELL the bullshit, you can SEE it from a distance!”At the time of publication, the post had been shared more than 440 times and attracted more than 25,000 views. It is one of many claims made about the prime minister’s vaccination in social media posts, including several that falsely suggested the cap was still on the syringe used for the jab (see examples here, here and here). A post claims PM Scott Morrison did not really receive the COVID-19 vaccination. The AnalysisDespite social media sceptics’ claims to the contrary, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was among a small group of people who received the nation’s first COVID-19 vaccinations on February 21, 2021.Mr Morrison was inoculated alongside Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, in an event covered on TV by ABC News, 7 News, 9 News and 10 News, as well as by various outlets online (examples here, here and here).The prime minister tweeted that he got the injection in order to “give further confidence to Australians these vaccines, which have been tested and approved by our medical experts, are safe and effective”.However, social media posts claimed the vaccination was faked, providing as supposed proof that the wrong syringe was used and that the safety cap was left on for the photo.A Department of Health spokesman confirmed in an email to AAP FactCheck that the prime minister was vaccinated on Sunday, February 21, along with several aged-care residents, nurses, doctors, disability care residents and hotel quarantine workers.Responding to claims that the wrong needle was used, he said: “The needles used were appropriate for the administration of the Pfizer vaccine and verified as appropriate against the clinical protocol.”The post’s picture and news footage of the vaccine administration shows Mr Morrison being injected with a needle featuring an orange tip. According to the International Standard, the colour code for a 25-gauge needle is orange.However, the text falsely states that this gauge of needle is not used for intramuscular vaccine injections. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine say needles with gauges from 22-25 should be used for the injection, which is performed in the deltoid muscle of the arm.The Australian Immunisation Handbook also recommends the same range of needle sizes for adults for the administration of vaccines in general. News footage of the first COVID-19 vaccinations, for example from 7 News, show numerous other vaccine recipients being treated with similar orange-tipped needles.The department told AAP FactCheck the prime minister’s vaccination “was real, delivered and supervised by trained clinicians and any suggestion that it was not is completely untrue”.Claims that the safety cap was left on the syringe seen in media coverage of the vaccinations are also false. An AFP photo taken during Mr Morrison’s vaccination shows the needle against his upper arm, while the needle can also be seen going into his arm before being withdrawn in ABC footage (1min 46sec mark). The same events can be seen in 7 News footage (21min 30sec mark) and 10 News footage (1min 5sec mark). PM Scott Morrison received his COVID-19 vaccination at Castle Hill in Sydney on February 21.","https://archive.vn/le9mp,http://archive.vn/YXBVS,http://archive.vn/eUt5d,http://archive.vn/fW85U,https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1363383198894288896/photo/1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YH1e5X4u_U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1232&v=RBFBqo74aug&feature=youtu.be,https://www.9news.com.au/videos/health/pm-receives-covid-19-vaccine/cklef48oh006t0gplvudws677,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8FESAA08yo&t=64s,https://www.smh.com.au/national/where-are-you-in-the-vaccine-queue-our-calculator-shows-when-you-re-likely-to-get-the-jab-20210221-p574eq.html,https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fcoronavirus%2Fprime-minister-scott-morrison-and-a-group-of-health-workers-will-get-a-covid19-vaccine-on-sunday%2Fnews-story%2F8a554be173f1f15d393ce146b9dd0a91&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55579770,https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1363383198894288896,http://archive.vn/YXBVS,https://perma.cc/HF63-CBYS?type=image,https://shop.standards.ie/preview/is/en/2016/i.s.eniso6009-2016.pdf?sku=1882513,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/downloads/standing-orders.pdf,https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/resources/handbook-tables/table-recommended-needle-size-length-and-angle-for-administering-vaccines,https://youtu.be/RBFBqo74aug,https://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/ViewMedia.aspx?mui=1&hid=E6EB94E27C387191C59195A88B29BC364A1083774B2CFB9AD120B09D8273279B,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YH1e5X4u_U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1232&v=RBFBqo74aug&feature=youtu.be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8FESAA08yo&t=64s",PM’s purported COVID jab ‘fraud’ is blunted by the evidence,,,,,,

The text reads, “Library found in Tibet with 84,000 secret manuscripts (books) which include the history of humanity of over 10,000 years!”The post goes on to claim the find at “Sakia (sic) Monastery” is “possibly the largest library in the world on the distant history of the planet. It was discovered behind a huge wall”.At the time of publication, the post had been viewed 7.5 million times and shared nearly 200 times, including by New Zealand users. A post claims that a library in Tibet contains “the history of humanity of over 10,000 years”. The AnalysisTibet’s Sakya monastery contains a library of international renown, but its works don’t date back 10,000 years – which would predate the earliest known writing and recorded history.The monastery was reportedly founded in 1073 by the Lama Khön Könchok Gyalpo. The initial temple, built to the north of a river, no longer remains, however a southern temple complex erected in 1268 still stands.Sakya is one of Tibet’s four major schools of Buddhism and the monastery’s library, as shown here in a video tour, is considered one of Tibet’s cultural treasures.It contains an enormous archive of texts including thousands of sacred Buddhist scriptures. Similar images to the one seen in the post can be found online (examples here, here and here).The post states that the library includes more than 84,000 scrolls that were discovered “behind a huge” wall.A 2010 Alamy photo caption contains matching details about the find, while a republished 2003 report from Chinese state media agency Xinhua includes many similar details, although it makes no mention of the manuscripts being “secret”.However, AAP FactCheck was unable to independently verify the size or nature of the find. Several articles, including from Chinese news service CGTN, and travel sites Lonely Planet and Rough Guides, list a different number of works or make no mention of the purported recent “discovery”.In addition, several experts said it was impossible that the most ancient works at the monastery could detail 10,000 years of human history as this would easily predate the oldest recorded writing.“The claim is false,” Joshua J. Mark, an editor and researcher for the Ancient History Encyclopedia website, said in an email.“The oldest known written literature of length is the Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 2150-1400 BCE) based on an earlier oral Sumerian tale or tales,” he said.While modern humans are thought to have existed for at least 300,000 years, the period of recorded history is much shorter and is tied to the development of text 5,000 years ago.Boyo Ockinga, an associate professor of ancient history at Macquarie University in Sydney, agreed that claims the library’s works dated back 10,000 years didn’t match with historical records.“The consensus of scholarly opinion is that writing was invented in Mesopotamia by the Sumerians in the late 4th to early 3rd millennium BC; there is some uncertainty about how much later the Egyptian hieroglyphic script was invented, but it will have been around the same time or a little later,” he said in an email.“These are the earliest scripts known, so the claim that these Tibetan texts are 10,000 years old is completely untenable.”The first forms of writing to develop were in cuneiform or hieroglyphics carved into hard surfaces like clay and stone. Cuneiform was used in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) between 3400 and 3300 BC, according to a British Library article on the history of writing.“Scholars generally agree that the earliest form of writing appeared almost 5500 years ago in Mesopotamia,” it says.Mr Mark told AAP FactCheck: “(Sumerian) cuneiform text is considered the oldest written work (along with a Sumerian temple hymn) extant. There is no evidence of earlier works anywhere in the world and certainly none dating back 10,000 years.”Regarding the reported library find, Mr Mark said it was possible the manuscripts predated the monastery being established in 1073.“Certainly, the 84,000 texts could have been composed elsewhere and brought to the monastery for safekeeping after that date .. but if they went back 10,000 years, by this time, we would have found some other evidence of writing going back that far,” he said.The scroll, made of papyrus, first emerged in Egypt around 5000 years ago, while early examples of paper from around 2000 years ago have been found in China. Buddhism was established approximately 2500 years ago.Similar posts shared on social media state that the library contains “the history of mankind over 1000 years”, while others include the 10,000-year-old claim. Tibet’s Buddhist monasteries form a key part of the country’s national identity.","https://archive.is/0pHzK,https://wondersoftibet.com/destinations/shigatse-and-gyantse/sakya-monastery/,http://www.sakyaheritage.org/DharmaLineage/sakyahistory.html,https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514e34416a4d78457a6333566d54/share_p.html,https://www.sakya.org/about/sakya-history/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JQVD3y44jkIt,https://www.cecc.gov/publications/commission-analysis/centuries-old-buddhist-texts-at-sakya-monastery-to-be-relocated,https://www.tibettravel.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/second-dunhuang.jpg,https://c8.alamy.com/comp/GE35NB/geography-travel-china-tibet-sakya-monastery-interior-view-library-GE35NB.jpg,https://www.chrisrochephotographer.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Tibet-1363-1024x684.jpg,https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-sakya-monastery-the-great-library-79524240.html,http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Nov/80109.htm,https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514e34416a4d78457a6333566d54/share_p.html,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/tibet/sakya/attractions/sakya-monastery/a/poi-sig/1239844/356125,https://www.roughguides.com/china/tibet/,https://marist.academia.edu/JoshuaMark,https://www.ancient.eu/Illuminated_Manuscripts/,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zB_cDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://www.britannica.com/science/human-evolution,https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/where-did-writing-begin#,https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/boyo-ockinga,https://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-to-write-cuneiform/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/hieroglyphic-writing,https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/where-did-writing-begin#,https://sites.dartmouth.edu/ancientbooks/2016/05/23/67/,https://www.ancient.eu/article/1120/paper-in-ancient-china/,https://www.ancient.eu/buddhism/,https://archive.is/ZmpkQ,https://www.facebook.com/newsandpersonality/posts/132541842055646","Claim of 10,000-year-old Tibet library find not worth paper it’s written on",,,,,,

The party recommitted to the policy in February 2020 under Mr Albanese.AAP FactCheck searched transcripts of Mr Morrison’s speeches and press conferences, as well as his press releases, media coverage and statements in parliament to establish his comments on the policy.One of the first examples of Mr Morrison referring to Labor’s net zero policy occurred in parliament in October 23, 2018, when the recently installed prime minister answered a question from Mr Shorten on energy policy.In his response, the prime minister cited comments from the Business Council of Australia about Labor’s interim target to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030: “The Business Council says: The (coalition’s) emissions target of 26 per cent is appropriate and achievable. 45 per cent – that’s Labor’s target – is an economy wrecking target.”He went on to quote the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, another business lobby group, as saying that Labor’s proposal for deeper cuts by 2030 “with a long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050 was not backed by a credible plan that protects economic growth”.“If you elect the Labor Party at the next election, you will pay more for everything – your electricity, your taxes and your private health insurance – because they are their policies,” Mr Morrison added.The first example AAP FactCheck found of Mr Morrison being quizzed by the media on the net zero policy came at a press conference in September 2019, when he said he wouldn’t commit to further targets beyond Australia’s existing agreement to reduce emissions 26 per cent by 2030.At a press conference in January 2020, Mr Morrison said the government was reviewing its policy on a net zero target, but he wouldn’t agree to the plan until he knew the cost. He then proceeded to attack Labor for not having a strategy to meet the target – a line he would later repeat multiple times in response to similar questions.“We’re going to meet and beat our emissions reduction targets … And I’m going to do it without increasing people’s taxes with a carbon tax,” he said.“I’m going to do it without pushing up their electricity prices. And I’m going to do it without wiping out important sectors of our economy upon which this nation depends, and particularly in regional communities, for their very living.”At another press conference on February 18, 2020, Mr Morrison repeated that the government wouldn’t adopt a policy until it knew the cost – and again suggested it could cost jobs, particularly in regional areas, after saying the coalition favoured “technology over taxation”.“Currently no one can tell me that going down that path won’t cost jobs, won’t put up your electricity prices, and won’t impact negatively on jobs in the economies of rural and regional Australia. And my government is absolutely committed to the jobs of rural and regional Australians,” he said.At a press conference on February 21, 2020, after Mr Albanese announced Labor was retaining the net zero policy, Mr Morrison said the opposition didn’t have a plan to meet the target or know its costs and again implied there could be job losses and increased electricity prices.Three days later, in response to questions from Labor’s then climate spokesman Mark Butler in parliament, Mr Morrison suggested the target would lead to higher consumer prices, as well as other costs.“(Labor has) zero positive news for the Australian people, who would be hit by a policy, if those opposite were ever elected, with a higher price on electricity, a higher price on farming, a higher price at the check-out, and a higher price on transport and petrol,” he said.On the same day, in response to a question from Mr Albanese, Mr Morrison implied that Labor’s policy would result in Australians losing their jobs after taking aim at the former Labor government’s introduction of an emissions trading scheme.“I’ll tell you what I won’t do: I’m not going to make a promise to Australians; I’m not going to put a tax on them to get emissions down; I’m not going to take away their jobs in the way that the leader of the opposition wants to do.”On February 25, Mr Morrison was quoted by The Guardian as criticising Labor’s commitment to net zero emissions in the context of the rapidly unfolding coronavirus pandemic.“Given the economic challenge, Labor’s reckless approach on the economy is particularly troubling, signing up to a target with no knowledge of what it would cost,” he said.During an interview with 2GB host Alan Jones on February 28, 2020, the prime minister again questioned whether the policy would harm the economy.“The reason we haven’t embraced this target, Alan, is because no one can tell me how you can do it and at the same time protect jobs, keep electricity prices down and support industries, particularly those in rural and regional Australia,” he said.However, Mr Morrison’s rhetoric surrounding a net zero target softened later in the year.During an interview on ABC in September, when asked why he wouldn’t commit to a net zero target, the prime minister said he was focused on “technology that delivers lower emissions, lower costs and more jobs” before adding it was the government’s policy to achieve the goal “in the second half of this century”.In November 2020, Mr Morrison again emphasised that emissions reductions needed to be achieved through technology rather than taxes but said Australia “would like to get zero emission as soon as possible” (here and here). Prime Minister Scott Morrison has questioned the costs of Labor’s net-zero emissions pledge.","https://www.pm.gov.au/media/address-national-press-club-barton-act,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/address-pacific-islands-forum,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-20/scott-morrison-refuses-to-commit-net-zero-carbon-emissions-2050/12682714,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-07/government-climate-policy-fight-press-club-wasnt-a-peep/13126136,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/pm-inches-closer-to-net-zero-by-2050-20210201-p56ybg,https://theconversation.com/scott-morrison-has-embraced-net-zero-emissions-now-its-time-to-walk-the-talk-154478,https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1078612,https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7108974/ministers-sharpen-climate-target-language/,https://billshorten.com.au/labor-commits-to-net-zero-pollution-by-2050,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-07/climate-change-federal-election-morrison-shorten-policies-votes/11084580?nw=0,https://anthonyalbanese.com.au/anthony-albanese-speech-leadership-in-a-new-climate-melbourne-friday-21-february-2020,https://www.pm.gov.au/media,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/694b7f60-e5cc-4e71-b474-84579ad4876a/&sid=0072,https://www.naa.gov.au/explore-collection/australias-prime-ministers/scott-morrison/timeline,https://twitter.com/BCAcomau/status/1011414577702031361,https://www.bca.com.au/,https://www.australianchamber.com.au/,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/doorstop-interview-chicago-usa,https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australias%20Intended%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20to%20a%20new%20Climate%20Change%20Agreement%20-%20August%202015.pdf,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-3,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/doorstop-melbourne-vic,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/doorstop-katherine-nt,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/f3ed3760-e998-492f-9f3e-11b9802d8a98/&sid=0162,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/f3ed3760-e998-492f-9f3e-11b9802d8a98/&sid=0151,http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/CPM/About-the-mechanism,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/scott-morrison-praises-gladys-berejiklians-plan-for-zero-net-emissions,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/interview-alan-jones-2gb-3,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/interview-david-speers-abc-200920,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/doorstop-interview-tokyo-japan,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/virtual-address-nsw-state-council",Did Scott Morrison say net zero emissions by 2050 would be ‘catastrophic’ for the economy?,,,,,,
4,,,,Somewhat True,,2021-02-22,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-growing-meat-consumption-doom-the-earth-to-severe-warming/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Will rising beef and sheep consumption mean the earth inevitably warms by more than two degrees?The Statement“If global consumption of beef and sheep continues to rise, eliminating emissions from fossil fuels will not be enough to prevent the earth warming beyond the 2C outer boundary set by the Paris agreement on climate change.”Peter Singer, bioethics professor, January 31, 2021.The AnalysisRenowned Australian philosopher Peter Singer has claimed that if meat consumption continues to grow, it won’t be possible to limit global warming to two degrees – even if emissions from burning fossil fuels are stopped.In a column in the Sydney Morning Herald on January 31, the bioethics professor at Princeton’s University Center for Human Values said that he stopped eating meat 50 years ago and this brought environmental benefits beyond the ethical reasons for his decision.“Some years ago, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reported that emissions from farmed animals contribute more to warming our planet than the entire transport sector,” Prof Singer, who is the author of multiple books on veganism and the ethics of food consumption, wrote in the article.“If global consumption of beef and sheep continues to rise, eliminating emissions from fossil fuels will not be enough to prevent the earth warming beyond the 2C outer boundary set by the Paris agreement on climate change.”AAP FactCheck examined Prof Singer’s statement that the earth will warm by more than 2C if beef and sheep consumption continues to rise, even if emissions from burning fossil fuels are eradicated.According to the most recent analysis by the FAO, from 2013, livestock account for 14.5 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions linked to humans. The production of cattle for beef and milk accounted for 65 per cent of these animal emissions, while sheep and goat milk and meat accounted for six per cent.The FAO said feed production and processing, and methane emissions from ruminant digestion were the main causes of emissions from livestock. The analysis included emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels in livestock supply chains.In Australia, direct livestock emissions account for around 10 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Department of Agriculture.According to the FAO, meat production has been static in the developed world but has doubled since 1980 in developing countries.A 2012 FAO report said total meat production was expected to increase by 76 per cent between 2005/7 and 2050, with beef increasing by 66 per cent and mutton by 92 per cent (Table 4.18, page 137). Beef and mutton were expected to make up 29 per cent of meat production in 2050. These predicted increases far outpaced the expected rate of population growth.When contacted by AAP FactCheck, Prof Singer said his statement on rising sheep and beef consumption leading to inevitable warming was based on a 2015 report published by the independent think-tank Chatham House.The report said developing nations were eating more animal protein as they became wealthier and “these consumption trends are incompatible with the objective of avoiding dangerous climate change” (page vii).Without changes, the report said, it would be almost impossible to limit global warming to two degrees above pre-industrial temperatures (page 6).It said global greenhouse gas emissions needed to more than halve from 49GtCO2e (gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent) to around 23GtCO2e by 2050, however if meat and dairy consumption continued to rise at current rates it would “soak up” all but a small share the world’s annual carbon budget.“Even under the most ambitious of decarbonisation scenarios, it will be near impossible for emissions from other sectors to drop to (the required) levels by the middle of the century,” the report said.The analysis was partially based on a 2014 article in the journal Nature Climate Change, which estimated agriculture emissions would increase by 77 per cent from 2009 to 2050 if the population reached 9.6 billion and “dietary preferences change with socio-economic transitions” (page 3 and table 2, page 4).That would take global agriculture emissions to 20.2GtCO2e, just below the 21GtCO2e the report used as its central estimate for limiting warming to 2C (page 5).It did not provide a breakdown of how much sheep and beef consumption contributed to emissions, however it noted that as “the demand for inefficient pathways of food supply (that is, livestock products) disproportionately increases, the whole system becomes not only larger, but also less efficient” (page 2).But the article also said agriculture emissions could rise just two per cent to 11.7GtCO2e by 2050 without any change in diets if there was a 50 per cent reduction in food waste and “sustainable intensification” – an increase in crop yields with more efficient use of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation.Other scenarios involving just an increase in crop yields or halving of food waste also brought agriculture emissions well under the 21GtCO2e level.However, the introduction of “healthy diets” in regions where there was a high consumption of sugars and saturated fats, including from livestock products, would cut emissions another 45 per cent, the article said.The main gains would come from a drop in emissions from enteric fermentation in ruminants, which include cattle, sheep and goats, and manure, and the return of crop and pasture lands to their natural states.Experts agreed that based on current trends of meat consumption it would be almost impossible to limit global warming to 2C. However, they also said it may be possible to significantly decrease agriculture emissions without cutting sheep and beef from the menu.Deakin University environmental science lecturer Michalis Hadjikakou, whose research is focused on the impact of diet, said if the production and consumption of sheep and beef continued to increase it would be very difficult to meet the 2C warming target, but eating meat would not necessarily lock in that outcome.“I would say that Peter Singer is not completely wrong but is not entirely accurate either,” he said.“Whether emissions from livestock alone would be enough to blow our whole carbon budget would depend on several factors: what other sectors in the economy are doing, whether there is land use change, and how much sequestration will be achieved.”Dr Hadjikakou cited a 2020 article in Science which said that even if fossil fuel emissions were rapidly reduced, food system emissions were “on a trajectory that would prevent achievement of the 1.5 and 2C targets before the end of the century”.But the article said it could be possible to limit warming by 2C by 2100 without moving to a plant-rich diet if yields increased and waste was reduced (Figure 2, page 3).Nevertheless, moving to a plant-rich diet would have the greatest impact on emissions, reducing them by 48 per cent compared to the business-as-usual scenario (figure 1, page 2).Dr Hadjikakou also co-authored a paper which found, based on current consumption trends and no future efficiency gains, livestock would account for 60 per cent of the 2C carbon budget by 2050 (page 131).But if efficiency increased, livestock would account for only 39 per cent of the carbon budget without a change in diets. The production of ruminant meat accounted for 48 per cent of livestock emissions in both scenarios.University of Melbourne sustainable agriculture professor and Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre director Richard Eckard is an expert on carbon neutral agriculture and developed the first greenhouse gas accounting tools for the sector.He said that it was true that based on current trends agriculture emissions would take up the bulk of the carbon budget for limiting warming to 2C.Prof Eckard added that not eating meat would address the majority of these emissions, but this was a simplistic analysis as only a small portion of the population had the choice of a purely plant-based diet.He added there was also promising research in reducing livestock emissions and, in combination with changes in diet, carbon-neutral agriculture would likely emerge in future.“If you look at just two recent products (3-NOP and Asparagopsis/ seaweed) there is now potential to reduce methane emissions by up to 80 per cent, which completely changes the argument,” he said. If current meat-eating trends continue, it will be difficult to limit the world to 2C warming.","https://www.smh.com.au/national/give-up-the-meat-i-ve-been-doing-it-for-50-years-20210131-p56y57.html,https://uchv.princeton.edu/people/peter-singer,https://petersinger.info/writings,http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/#:~:text=Total%20emissions%20from%20global%20livestock,of%20all%20anthropogenic%20GHG%20emissions.&text=Cutting%20across%20all%20activities%20and,of%20the%20livestock%20sector's%20emissions.,http://www.fao.org/about/en/,https://www.agriculture.gov.au/ag-farm-food/climatechange/australias-farming-future/livestock-emissions,http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/meat/home.html#:~:text=Meat%20%26%20Meat%20Products,-Meat%20is%20the&text=While%20meat%20consumption%20has%20been,since%201980%20in%20developing%20countries.&text=World%20meat%20production%20is%20projected,is%20expected%20in%20developing%20countries.,http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/esa/Global_persepctives/world_ag_2030_50_2012_rev.pdf,https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html,https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/CHHJ3820%20Diet%20and%20climate%20change%2018.11.15_WEB_NEW.pdf,https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275118744_Importance_of_food-demand_management_for_climate_mitigation,http://www.fao.org/in-action/enteric-methane/background/what-is-enteric-methane/en/#:~:text=In%20ruminants%2C%20methane%20is%20produced,by%20the%20animal%20through%20burping.,https://www.britannica.com/animal/ruminant,https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/michalis-hadjikakou,https://carbontracker.org/carbon-budgets-where-are-we-now/,https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-carbon-sequestration?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6517/705#BIBL,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800918310498,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/2680-richard-eckard,https://www.piccc.org.au/about-piccc/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218311111,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-18/csiro-super-seaweed-cattle-supplement-wins-$1m-prize/12992888#:~:text=Like%20taking%20'100%20million%20cars,from%20the%20animals'%20bodily%20emissions.",Does growing meat consumption doom the earth to severe warming?,,,,,,
5,,,,Partly False,,2021-02-22,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/viral-posts-should-dig-deeper-for-true-fossil-fuels-origin/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook meme posted by an Australian user makes several claims relating to oil – including about the origin of the term “fossil fuels”.“Did you know? Oil does not come from fossils, nor from decomposing matter,” the post states between pictures of oil derricks, an offshore oil platform, a car being filled from a petrol bowser and the Mr Monopoly character from the popular board game.“Rockefeller coined it (sic) the term ‘fossil fuels,’ inducing the idea of scarcity to increase profit margins,” it goes on to say. “The reality being, that oil is actually a mineral of the earth, constantly being regenerated.”At the time of publication, the February 10 post had been viewed more than 18,000 times and shared more than 200 times. A meme makes several claims relating to oil – including about the origin of the term “fossil fuels”. The AnalysisContrary to the meme’s claims, the phrase “fossil fuels” has been around since at least the 1700s – well before oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller’s time. And while there exist alternate theories about the formation of oil, the scientific consensus is that it is formulated from decomposed organic matter.Several different versions of the same meme have been shared widely on Facebook, including here, here, here and here.John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) founded Standard Oil, which became one of the world’s largest corporations until it was broken up by the US government.However, the term “fossil fuels” has been in use since before his lifetime, dating back to at least the 1700s. One of its first appearances is in the English translation of German chemist Caspar Neumann’s 1759 book, The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann and can be seen here in the book’s index.Neumann (1683-1737) was considered to be influential in the development of chemistry by distinguishing clearly between pure and applied chemistry. He was also named a Fellow of the Royal Society scientific academy in London.The term featured in numerous other works published before Rockefeller’s birth, including in the title of an 1835 book on the history of fossil fuels and the coal trade in Great Britain.Fossil fuels are defined by the US Energy Information Administration as an energy source such as petroleum, coal or natural gas formed in the earth’s crust from decayed organic material.Britannica defines them as “any of a class of hydrocarbon-containing materials of biological origin occurring within earth’s crust that can be used as a source of energy”.Experts contacted by AAP FactCheck rejected the post’s claim that oil does not come “from decomposing matter”.Andrew R. Gorman, head of the geology department at the University of Otago in Dunedin, said the Facebook post was not accurate.“The meme certainly is misleading, but more stretching the truth than outright lying,” Dr Gorman told AAP FactCheck in an email.“We usually think of a fossil as a ‘trace of organic life preserved in rock‘; so with that definition, there is little or no organic material in fossils.“Therefore you can say with hand on heart that oil does not come from fossils. This is of course misleading. The ancient organic particles that break down into oil could not be preserved as fossils because they have turned into oil!“Most oil and gas produced on the planet comes from well-established processes whereby complex molecules of organic material are broken down into much simpler hydrocarbon molecules.”Simon Lang, professor of petroleum geoscience and director of the Centre for Energy Geoscience at the University of Western Australia, also took issue with the meme’s claims.“This is nonsense,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.“Most oil and gas fields are the result of breakdown of organic ‘kerogens’ or particles made of organic molecules into a great arc of differentiated-molecular-weight hydrocarbon chain molecules. All of this is well understood for over 70-80 years and more.”Prof Lang said isotope analysis on these hydrocarbons meant scientists could even tell the organic molecules they had been formed from, such as lipids from ancient fish.Some researchers have argued for an “abiotic” theory of oil, which asserts that oil and gas come from non-biological chemical processes taking place at high temperatures deep in the earth. However, the theory is considered controversial and is generally rejected by experts.“Abiotic methods of petroleum production are possible as the by-product of chemical processes deep in the earth’s crust,” Dr Gorman said.However, he added that “the volumes of hydrocarbon produced this way have not yet been found to be economically significant”.The meme’s claim that oil is constantly being regenerated is technically true – but on a time scale far longer than any human will live to see.“Oil can indeed be considered a mineral,” Dr Gorman said. “And it is constantly being regenerated. You just have to wait a few million years for that to happen – so again this is a misleading statement.”Similar claims have been previously debunked here, here and here. Most oil and gas fields result from the breakdown of organic kerogens, an expert told AAP FactCheck.","https://archive.vn/9pFj1,https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Monopoly,https://archive.is/ewf2X,https://archive.vn/P34rV,https://archive.vn/pXLHu,https://archive.vn/otTOO,https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-D-Rockefeller,https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-standard-oil-monopoly,https://sites.psu.edu/eartharchives/2020/04/13/fossil-fuels/,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OBUAAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA492&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=fossil&f=false,https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/neumann-caspar,https://catalogues.royalsociety.org/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Persons&id=NA6151&pos=1,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fossil+fuel%22&tbas=0&biw=1680&bih=907&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1700%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1839&tbm=bks,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/The_History_and_Description_of_Fossil_Fu/x2UP07XPs5oC?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=F,https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel,https://www.otago.ac.nz/geology/staff/andrew-gorman.html,https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/simon-lang,https://www.ceg.uwa.edu.au/,https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-77587-4_5,http://www.fao.org/3/x5738e/x5738e05.htm,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:338107/FULLTEXT01.pdf,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/abiotic-petroleum-debate-rocks-on/article736733/,https://factcheck.afp.com/facebook-posts-falsely-claim-us-oil-magnate-coined-term-fossil-fuels-introduce-idea-scarcity,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/02/fact-check-no-proof-found-that-john-d-rockefeller-paid-to-have-petroleum-designated-a-fossil-fuel-to-drive-price-up.html,https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2160978659591/fact-check-no-proof-found-that-john-d-rockefeller-paid-to-have-petroleum-designated-a-fossil-fuel-to-drive-price-up",Viral posts should dig deeper for true ‘fossil fuels’ origin,,,,,,
6,,,,False,,2021-02-19,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/pms-claim-australian-coal-produces-much-lower-emissions-is-nonsense/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Does foreign coal produce 50 per cent more emissions than Australia’s?The Statement“Because Australian coal compared to the coal that is sourced from other countries, the other countries have 50 per cent higher emissions than Australian coal.”Scott Morrison, Liberal Party leader and Australian prime minister, December 15, 2020.The AnalysisPrime Minister Scott Morrison has claimed that coal from rival exporters produces 50 per cent more emissions than the local product, leading to a “lose-lose” scenario for the environment and the economy if Australia’s supply was displaced.The prime minister made the statement during a press conference on December 15 when he was asked about reports China was introducing a ban on some Australian coal imports.“If this were to be the practice, the four billion-odd that goes into coal-fired power generation in China, it really is a lose-lose here,” Mr Morrison said.“Because Australian coal compared to the coal that is sourced from other countries, the other countries have 50 per cent higher emissions than Australian coal. As a result, that would be a bad outcome for the environment. It would be a bad outcome for the trading relationship between Australia and China, that both countries benefit from.”The comments were reported in The Australian, the Australian Financial Review and the ABC.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Morrison’s statement that coal from other countries produces 50 per cent higher emissions than Australian coal.When asked about the basis of the statement, the prime minister’s office did not provide a source but claimed it had already been fact-checked by the ABC and found to be accurate.The ABC fact check investigated a 2015 statement from then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull that global emissions could rise if Australia stopped exporting coal as “our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries”.The fact check said: “Australia’s coal is on average high quality as a result of its low moisture and ash content, and high carbon content, compared with other countries, particularly Indonesia, the largest coal exporter in the world.”However, it largely focused on ash content and levels of polluting trace elements. It did not include analysis of the relative greenhouse gas emissions of coal from various exporters, and none of its sources showed that other countries’ coal produced 50 per cent higher emissions than Australian coal.Mr Morrison’s office did not respond to further questions from AAP FactCheck about the basis for the statement.Australia exports both metallurgical coal, used to make steel, and thermal coal, used in coal-fired power stations. As the prime minister referred to coal used in Chinese power stations, AAP FactCheck focused on carbon emissions from thermal coal.According to estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA), Australia was the second-largest exporter of thermal coal in 2020, accounting for 20 per cent of exports, behind Indonesia with 40 per cent. Australia was the sixth-largest overall producer of thermal coal.AAP FactCheck contacted Geoscience Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Coal Association Research Programme, however none were able to provide information comparing coal emissions or research on the emissions produced by Australian coal.However, experts said emissions from coal were generally tied to the product’s grade and its energy content – although this relationship was far from linear.A report provided by the Minerals Council for the ABC fact check noted that Australia was “a significant exporter of high energy-content thermal coals” which “produce fewer emissions per unit of electricity produced”.The IEA provided AAP FactCheck with provisional 2019 figures comparing the energy content of coal exports from several of the world’s top coal exporters and producers.These showed that the energy content of the two main types of thermal coal for export – “other bituminous” and the lower-grade “sub-bituminous” – was broadly similar across all countries, with the exception of India, which generally produced lower-quality coal.The figures did show, however, that Australia only exported higher-energy bituminous coal, while its main competitor, Indonesia, mainly exported lower-grade sub-bituminous coal.When AAP FactCheck weighted the IEA’s data for export volumes, the energy content of Australian thermal coal was third-lowest – but still 13.2 per cent higher than Indonesian coal and 64.7 per cent higher than Indian coal.However, it should be noted that India exported a negligible amount of thermal coal – around 0.3 per cent of Australia’s volume – therefore it is unlikely a trade dispute would result in China burning significantly more Indian coal.Dale Hazelton, head of Asia Pacific thermal coal at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told AAP FactCheck it was important to note there wasn’t a linear relationship between emissions and energy content, which meant that emissions from similar power plants burning different grades of coal may be little different.“Generally speaking, all bituminous (high-quality) coals are the same in terms of carbon emissions,” he said.“If you compare Australian bituminous coals to every other country’s bituminous coals, they’re roughly equivalent in energy content. So Russia and Australia are going to have roughly the same combustion emissions.“Australian coal tends towards bituminous in rank, which is lower-emitting, while the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, Indonesia, tends towards the lignite (higher-emission) side.”Mr Hazelton cited 2006 guidelines from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which estimated the emissions from different coal grades when used in “energy industries” (page 2.16).The guidelines said emissions from coal ranged from 94,600kg of greenhouse gas per terajoule of energy from other bituminous coal to 96,100kg for sub-bituminous coal – a difference of just 1.6 per cent. The figure for lignite was 101,000kg – 6.8 per cent higher than the bituminous grade.One of the authors of the IPCC guidelines, Gregg Marland, an adjunct research professor at North Carolina’s Appalachian State University, told AAP FactCheck via email that the heat produced by coal increased with its carbon content, which in turn increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.This meant that while higher-grade coals produced more energy, they also produced more emissions relative to their weight due to their higher carbon content.“If we measure CO2 emissions (against) units of (energy), then all coals are indeed pretty closely the same,” he said.Dr Marland referred to a 2006 report he co-authored for the then-US Climate Change Science Program which said the carbon content of coal was directly linked to its heat output (figure 2, page II-14).A 2016 US Environmental Protection Agency guidance document gave similar figures to the IPCC guidelines, with bituminous coal producing 93.28kg of carbon dioxide per energy unit, compared to 97.17kg for sub-bituminous coal – a difference of 4.2 per cent (table A-3, page 19).AAP FactCheck found few sources directly comparing the emissions from various grades of coal, however one 1994 article from the US Energy Information Administration compared the CO2 emission factors – the amount of the gas produced for the same energy output – for different coal samples from across the country.It found the difference in carbon emissions between the lowest-emission bituminous coal and the highest-emission lignite nationwide was only 9.6 per cent (table FE4).Meanwhile, a 2015 report on the quality and environmental impact of Australian coal by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) showed Australia’s export thermal coal had the same or lower energy content than Russian and South African coal but higher energy than Indonesian and Indian coal, based on 2014 figures from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie (page 2).Report author Tim Buckley, the director of Australia/South Asia energy finance studies at IEEFA, said the prime minister’s claim that other countries’ thermal coal produced 50 per cent more emissions was “nonsense”.Mr Buckley said the development of modern, efficient coal power plants also meant the quality of the coal had less of an impact on emissions than in older plants, adding that a ban on Australian coal exports to China would make no difference to global emissions.“If our coal isn’t burned in China, then someone else will burn our coal. The idea that (a ban) will increase emissions is nonsense.”A 2013 Congressional Research Service report noted CO2 emissions from coal-fired plants could be reduced by burning higher grades of coal, however it also noted a strong link between the type and efficiency of coal plants and emissions.University of Adelaide associate professor Liam Wagner, who researches energy markets, agreed that in general, emissions produced from burning other countries’ thermal coal would not be 50 per cent higher than emissions from Australian coal.“Australian black steaming coal is just as dirty as high-quality black steaming coal from anywhere else, and by quality I mean energy per tonne of coal,” Dr Wagner said.“But to say in general Australia’s coal is better or worse than coal in China is, again, a nonsense.” Then treasurer Scott Morrison wielding a lump of coal in parliament in 2017.","https://www.pm.gov.au/media/doorstop-riverside-tas,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/china-ban-on-coal-an-fta-breach/news-story/090fccbbaac229a3f8c4dfb9a4038fa0,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/china-coal-ban-obviously-a-breach-of-trade-rules-morrison-20201215-p56nk1,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-15/scott-morrison-china-trade-tension-coal-bans/12984322,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/fact-check-is-australias-export-coal-cleaner/6952190,https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/joint-press-conference-announcement-of-appointment-of-dr-alan-finkel-ao-as,https://publications.industry.gov.au/publications/resourcesandenergyquarterlyseptember2020/documents/Resources-and-Energy-Quarterly-Sept-2020-Met-Coal.pdf,https://publications.industry.gov.au/publications/resourcesandenergyquarterlyseptember2020/documents/Resources-and-Energy-Quarterly-Sept-2020-Thermal-Coal.pdf,https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2020/annex#abstract,https://www.iea.org/about,https://www.ga.gov.au/about,https://minerals.org.au/about-mca,https://www.acarp.com.au/#:~:text=The%20Australian%20Coal%20Industry's%20Research,levy%20paid%20on%20saleable%20coal.,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/fact-check-is-australias-export-coal-cleaner/6952190,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RJUzLW9MQCuPZHP6kbautpW-sqrS029k/view,https://www.woodmac.com/about-us/our-people/dale-hazelton/,https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_2_Ch2_Stationary_Combustion.pdf,https://earth.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/dr-gregg-h-marland,https://www.carboncyclescience.us/sites/default/files/documents/2015/SOCCR_Entire_Report_Draft2.pdf,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ccsp_vision.pdf,https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-03/documents/stationaryemissions_3_2016.pdf,https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/co2_article/co2.html,https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IEEFA-Australian-coal-briefing-note.pdf,https://ieefa.org/about/,https://www.woodmac.com/about-us/,https://ieefa.org/author/tim/,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43343.pdf,https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/liam.wagner",PM’s claim Australian coal produces much lower emissions is ‘nonsense’,,,,,,
7,,,,False,,2021-02-17,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-of-gates-vaccine-paralysing-girls-in-india-resurrected/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post falsely links the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to claims of girls in India being paralysed by vaccines.The January 31 post, shared by a New Zealand user, features a meme that reads: “Between 2000 and 2017 490,000 girls in India became paralyzed by Gate’s (sic) vaccines.”The meme includes a photo of billionaire philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.At the time of publication, the post had generated more than 530 shares and 30,000 views, while another example, also posted by a New Zealand user, had more than 370 shares and 19,000 views. A post links Bill and Melinda Gates to claims of girls being paralysed by vaccines. The AnalysisThe false suggestion that polio vaccines funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation paralysed Indian children can be traced to April 2020 claims by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of former US president John F Kennedy.However, then as now, the meme is not correct. The inclusion of a photo of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appears to be an attempt to tie her to the Gates duo and the accusations.The April 8 Instagram post by Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed: “Indian doctors blamed the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialled back Gates’ vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB (India’s National Advisory Board.”Mr Kennedy’s claims were further fuelled by conspiracy website The BL.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been funding research and child-immunisation programs against diseases such as polio in India.In 2017, the Indian government issued a statement to dismiss “inaccurate and misleading” press reports that suggested its collaboration with the foundation had stopped. The Gates foundation continues to work in India.Regarding Mr Kennedy and the post’s paralysation claims, World Health Organization (WHO) data lists only 17 cases of vaccine-derived polio viruses (cVDPV cases) in India between 2000 to 2017. These consisted of 15 cases in 2009 and two in 2010.The WHO said the South-East Asia region, including India, was certified polio-free in 2014, with the last case of wild poliovirus reported in West Bengal, India, on January 13, 2011. A 2013 article in the Indian Journal of Medical Research noted that India was “hyperendemic for polio” until the early 1990s, with up to 1000 children paralysed daily.According to the Polio Global Eradication Initiative, vaccine-derived polioviruses are possible but rare. They have been increasing in recent years not because of vaccination programs, such as those backed by the foundation, but “due to low immunisation rates within communities”.“The best way to prevent them and stop them when there is an outbreak is to vaccinate children. The polio vaccine protects children whether the kind of polio is wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus,” its website says.https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame_objective2/oral_polio_vaccine/VAPPandcVDPVFactSheet-Feb2015.pdf“>The WHO says cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio occurred roughly once for every 2.7 million doses of the oral polio vaccine administered.Mr Kennedy’s claim of widespread “vaccine-strain polio” cases in his Instagram post differs to an article published under his name on April 15, 2020 in which he blamed the Gates’ campaign for “a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017”.Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a broad definition for the sudden onset of paralysis or weakness in any part of the body of a child. Causes can include environmental toxins, genetic conditions and infection by viruses, according to a Harvard Medical School post. NPAFP relates to any cases not linked to polio.Mr Kennedy’s article links to a 2018 study in India, which highlighted a correlation between NPAFP rates and polio vaccination rounds.The study found that the frequency of polio vaccinations was “directly or indirectly related to the incidence of the paralysis”, with the authors calculating there had been more than 490,000 “excess” cases of NPAFP between 2000 and 2017 in one state.However, the findings have been criticised as “questionable” and “spurious” due to claimed flaws in the methodology, such as reporting cases in children aged between five and 15 years when the oral polio vaccine campaign targeted children under five.The correlation observed in some Indian states did not hold in others, even when polio vaccinations were delivered with the same frequency, one critic said.The study’s authors replied by saying none of the objections were valid and the inclusion of children aged 5-15 years was appropriate.They also stressed: “We did not say that the NPAFP reported in our paper were cases of vaccine-induced paralysis. Non-polio AFP, by its very definition, excludes polio vaccine-induced paralysis”.The BBC previously reported that Indian public health officials pointed out the improved monitoring for paralysation cases compared to previous decades, potentially accounting for changes in NPAFP prevalence.The photo of Ms Ardern with Bill and Melinda Gates included in the meme was taken at their foundation’s Goalkeepers Summit during September 2019 in New York, where the NZ prime minister met with Mr Gates and addressed the event.While the post does not explicitly link Ms Ardern to the vaccine claims, the photo echoes conspiracy theories that Mr Gates visited New Zealand to trial a COVID-19 vaccine that would microchip recipients. AAP FactCheck debunked that conspiracy here and a similar claim here.Commenting on the post, a spokesman for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told AAP FactCheck in an email that the claims were false and provided a link to another fact check debunking the same suggestions.Similar claims about Indian children being disabled by the polio vaccine – with figures ranging from 47,000 to 496,000 – have been debunked here, here, here and here. Bill Gates and wife Melinda on a 2011 trip to Jamsot Village near Patna, India","https://archive.vn/G29Xx,https://archive.vn/FQfF7,https://archive.fo/AUx82,https://www.ft.com/content/182b7b9a-235b-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b,https://web.archive.org/web/20200423152046/https://thebl.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-answers-bill-gates-on-the-dangers-of-a-mandatory-ccp-virus-vaccine.html,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/01/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Pledge-%2410-Billion-in-Call-for-Decade-of-Vaccines,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio?_ga=2.125934605.1275064394.1613439274-1612056701.1613439274,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Where-We-Work/India-Office/Health,https://web.archive.org/web/20200502090716/https://pib.gov.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=158277,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Where-We-Work/India-Office,https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx,https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/27-03-2019-marking-five-years-of-polio-free-certification-who-south-east-asia-region-uses-polio-legacy-to-enhance-overall-immunization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3734678/,https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/, <a href=,https://truthtopowernews.com/490000-children-paralyzed-gates-vaccines-kill-more-disease-they-prevent-we-are-guinea-pigs-drug,http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/the-replacement-polio/,https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/3399,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339181/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339160/,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-21207601,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/covid-19-bill-gates-wife-melinda-made-plea-to-ardern-over-coronavirus-vaccine-documents/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1604437201804/NEWSHUB-bill-gates-jacinda-ardern-new-york-1120.jpg,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/jacinda-ardern-meets-bill-melinda-gates-during-new-york-trip.html,https://www.aap.com.au/bill-gates-wasnt-in-new-zealand-this-year-and-those-microchip-claims-have-already-been-debunked/,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-about-covid-tests-and-famous-new-zealand-visitors/,https://factcheck.afp.com/gates-foundation-targeted-misleading-claims-about-india-polio-vaccine-campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/23/facebook-posts/anti-vaxxers-spread-conspiracy-about-bill-gates-an/,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/conspiracy-theory-bill-gates-backed-polio-vaccine-disabled-kids-1707666-2020-08-04,https://fullfact.org/online/gates-polio-vaccine/,https://factcheck.afp.com/gates-foundation-targeted-misleading-claims-about-india-polio-vaccine-campaign",False claims of Gates vaccine paralysing girls in India resurrected,,,,,,
8,,,,Somewhat True,,2021-02-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/has-the-australian-government-axed-key-climate-adaptation-projects/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Has the Australian government cut funding for two key climate change adaptation projects and ignored the issue in major reports?The Statement“The government completely excluded climate adaptation from their 2017 review of climate change policies. They cut funding for significant adaptation work at CSIRO, completely defunded the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility and produced a new National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework that fails to take climate change seriously.”Mark Butler, Labor MP and former opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, January 25, 2021.The AnalysisLabor’s former climate change spokesman has claimed the Australian government was failing to prepare for a warming climate, arguing it had cut significant funding from adaptation research.Opposition MP Mark Butler, who was shifted out of the climate change and energy role in a January 28 reshuffle, made the comments in response to a government commitment to develop a new “climate resilience and adaptation strategy”.Environment Minister Sussan Ley used a January 25 speech to the international Climate Adaptation Summit to make the pledge, joining more than 100 other countries that responded to the United Nations-led call.Reacting to the announcement, Mr Butler said the government had a history of failing to prepare for climate adaptation – an umbrella term that refers to the management of the various consequences of a changing climate.“The government completely excluded climate adaptation from their 2017 review of climate change policies,” he said.“They cut funding for significant adaptation work at CSIRO, completely defunded the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility and produced a new National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework that fails to take climate change seriously.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Butler’s multiple claims.2017 Climate Change ReviewWhen contacted about the suggestion the government “completely excluded” adaptation from its 2017 review of climate policies, Mr Butler’s office pointed AAP FactCheck to the fact the related report did not include any mentions of the terms “climate adaptation”.The Department of the Environment undertook the review in 2017 to ensure the country’s climate change policies were consistent with its 2030 emissions targets under the Paris Agreement.While the final report does not feature the exact words “climate adaptation”, it deals primarily with policies that will influence Australia’s emissions in the context of the targets, covering areas such as electricity generation and transport.Dr Peter Tangney, a senior lecturer in environmental politics and policy from Flinders University in Adelaide, noted in an email to AAP FactCheck that the report does highlight government funding for climate modelling among other research work.“This research can be used for informing climate adaptation, so Mr Butler’s statement is not entirely correct,” he said.The report highlights CSIRO’s $37 million in investment over 10 years for “decadal climate forecasting capability”, while it also mentions government research funding towards projects such as international efforts to protect coral reefs and coastal ecosystems (pages 14-15).CSIRO Adaptation Research Funding CutsFor the claim that the government “cut funding for significant adaptation work at CSIRO”, Mr Butler’s office referred AAP FactCheck to a 2016 RenewEconomy article about job cuts at the national science organisation.The article drew on reports from the Sydney Morning Herald and Australian Financial Review (AFR) about the staffing changes.However, the newspaper articles did not state that funding was being cut for CSIRO’s climate adaptation work. In fact, the articles suggested CSIRO was shifting its priorities away from climate science towards measures like mitigation.CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall told the AFR: “We have spent probably a decade trying to answer the question ‘is the climate changing?’ The next question now is what do we do about it? The people that were so brilliant at measuring and modelling (climate change), they might not be the right people to figure out how to adapt to it.”However, a history of climate adaptation research at CSIRO posted on the organisation’s website noted that adaptation research had “started to fragment” since 2016 following the closure of its Climate Adaptation Flagship two years earlier.This flagship was launched in 2008 with the aim of equipping Australia with “practical and effective adaptation options to climate change and variability”.It received an initial $44 million over four years as part of the then coalition government’s commitment of $103 million towards it and a CSIRO Energy Flagship in the 2007-8 Budget (page 129).The funding gradually grew to $43 million per year in 2010-11, when Labour was in power, CSIRO said. However, the CSIRO underwent an internal reorganisation in 2014 (page 10-11), when a coalition government was in place, during which the Climate Adaptation Flagship was absorbed into several of nine new business units.CSIRO said by 2016, when Malcolm Turnbull had taken over as prime minister from Liberal counterpart Tony Abbott, the adaptation efforts had begun to be “re-oriented into other activities”.Professor Rod Keenan, the chair of the University of Melbourne’s department of forest and ecosystem science, told AAP FactCheck in an email that although the Climate Adaptation Flagship was “terminated” there continued to be fragmented research undertaken in the field in various CSIRO divisions.CSIRO declined to comment on Mr Butler’s claim when contacted by AAP FactCheck. Its most recent annual report, from 2019-20, makes little specific mention of climate adaptation research, aside from the organisation’s work on a Great Barrier collaboration (page 50), although it highlights CSIRO’s work for the government on climate and disaster resilience following the catastrophic 2019-20 bushfire season (page 19).National Climate Change Adaptation Research FacilityAs the source of the claim that the government defunded the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF), Mr Butler’s staff cited a Guardian Australia article from January 2020.The article said the decision to discontinue the NCCARF’s funding in 2017, when Scott Morrison was treasurer, meant Australia was “not well positioned” to tackle the effects of climate change, according to director Jean Palutikof.The facility was established in 2008 in a partnership with Griffith University to provide decision-makers with information to help them manage the risks from climate change. The government said more than $56 million was spent on the project.However, the bulk of the money came under Labour governments between 2008 and 2013. Funding was reduced to $9 million over three years under the Abbott government in 2014 (page 106).Funding was further cut to $600,000, to be shared with CSIRO, in the 2017-18 budget, which was delivered by Mr Morrison (page 94). It did not receive any further program-wide funding. Labor pledged to restore the NCCARF’s funding to $3 million per year during its unsuccessful 2019 election campaign.Professor Palutikof, the facility’s former director, told AAP FactCheck the NCCARF continued to receive funding in the form of grants for specific projects.“You can be funded for a five-year program and you can be funded for a single $100,000, three-month project. We no longer have the program-scale money from the federal government, but we have had some small project money,” she said.National Disaster Risk Reduction FrameworkAccording to Mr Butler, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework (NDRRF), which was established in 2018, does not take climate change seriously.As a source for the claim, his office pointed AAP FactCheck to a line on page six of the report which states, “This forecast does not account for the effects of a changing climate, which are expected to magnify these costs; nor does it account for losses that cannot be quantified but are no less important to people.”However, this was a direct reference to a Deloitte Access Economics analysis, which predicted natural disasters would cost the Australian economy $39 billion per year by 2050 based on current population growth.Elsewhere, the framework includes numerous mentions of climate change and adaptation, including in the first of four listed “drivers for action” (page 5), which begins: “Many natural hazards are becoming more frequent and more intense, driven by Australia’s changing climate.”Prof Keenan said while the NDRRF was a well-thought-out statement on disaster reduction within the context of climate change, it included no clear processes for implementing recommendations or allocating responsibilities across the different levels of governments.However, Dr Tangney said the framework was not designed to prescribe specific actions.“As a guideline for developing policies and for co-ordinating action between federal, state and local levels, it is well tailored to address climate change hazards assuming that it is used by the federal government to direct and distribute funding and other resources in practice,” he said.“However, its effectiveness in practice will depend on the extent to which the federal government uses it to direct funding and other resources to advance climate adaptation activities in preparation for, response to, and recovery from extreme climate events and climate change.”When asked about Mr Butler’s statement and his claims of funding cuts, a spokeswoman for the environment department pointed AAP FactCheck to several other government-backed initiatives, including $30 million for the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes and $37 million for the CSIRO Climate Science Centre.Prof Palutikof said you could probably make cases that the current government had both increased and cut overall funding for climate change adaptation due to the fragmented nature of the work.“The bottom line is that the federal government has no coherent framework for climate adaptation activities, and funding is incremental and sporadic,” she said. Natural disasters will cost the Australian economy $39 billion per year by 2050, an analysis by Deloitte Access Economics predicts.","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-28/labor-mark-butler-albanese-joel-fitzgibbon-climate-change/13097682,https://minister.awe.gov.au/ley/media-releases/australia-commits-climate-resilience,https://www.adaptation-undp.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-images/call_for_action_on_adaptation_and_resilience_v_3_feb_2021.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-25/climate-adaptation-resilience-net-zero-australia-sussan-ley/13088500,https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/18690271-59ac-43c8-aee1-92d930141f54/files/2017-review-of-climate-change-policies.pdf,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/2017-review-of-climate-change-policies,https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/peter.tangney,https://reneweconomy.com.au/jaw-dropping-csiro-job-cuts-to-gut-climate-science-unit-38881/,https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-will-be-all-gone-as-csiro-swings-jobs-axe-scientists-say-20160204-gml7jy.html,https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/csiro-puts-350-staff-on-notice-in-netflixstyle-culture-revamp-20160204-gml8k3.html,https://people.csiro.au/m/l/larry-marshall,https://research.csiro.au/climate/introduction/history-of-climate-adaptation-research-in-csiro/,https://csiropedia.csiro.au/three-new-national-research-flagships-join-the-fleet/,https://archive.budget.gov.au/2007-08/bp2/bp2.pdf,https://csiropedia.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CSIROAnnualReport2014-15.pdf,https://research.csiro.au/climate/introduction/history-of-climate-adaptation-research-in-csiro/,https://www.naa.gov.au/explore-collection/australias-prime-ministers,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/116805-rodney-keenan,https://www.csiro.au/en/About/Our-impact/Reporting-our-impact/Annual-reports/19-20-annual-report,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/16/coalitions-axing-of-of-funding-to-climate-change-adaptation-body-condemned,https://nccarf.edu.au/,https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation,https://archive.budget.gov.au/2014-15/bp2/BP2_consolidated.pdf,https://archive.budget.gov.au/2017-18/bp2/bp2.pdf,https://www.billshorten.com.au/labor_s_1_billion_plan_to_protect_our_environment_saturday_4_may_2019,https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18740-jean-palutikof,https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/emergency/files/national-disaster-risk-reduction-framework.pdf,https://climateextremes.org.au/,https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/Climate-Science-Centre",Has the Australian government axed key climate adaptation projects?,,,,,,

Underneath and underlined in red is the text: “The World Health Organization admits there is no scientific medical reason for any healthy person to wear a mask outside of a hospital.”The text continues, “Sadly our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news. If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask. When used alone, masks can give you a false feeling of protection and can even be a source of infection when not used correctly.”Circled in red at the top of the screenshot is the publication date of January 25, 2021. At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 270 times and viewed more than 15,000 times. A post claims the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested healthy people stop wearing a mask. The AnalysisThe Facebook post falsely suggests the World Health Organization recently advised healthy people to stop wearing face masks. While the post features a photo of WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, it does not attribute any quotes to him.The post features the same text and image as a January 25 article titled, “WHO: You Do NOT Need To Wear A Mask“, published on the Principia Scientific International (PSI) website.The original article, since updated, began with the words, “In a telling admission made on January 22, 2021”, and finished with “watch the video of the press announcement” before linking to an archived version of the WHO’s COVID-19 information page.However, the WHO press conference from that date does not include the advice. Rather, in response to a question about the efficacy of masks against new variants of the virus, WHO technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove told journalists: “Masks are one aspect of control, one aspect of reducing the spread of this virus and they can’t be used alone. We need to emphasise that, because no one solution is enough – not masks alone is enough, not physical distancing, not hand hygiene.” (Video mark 46min)Dr Kerkhove added that the WHO was not changing its guidance on protection measures due to the new virus strains. She said its guidance included a recommendation that people wear three-layered fabric masks made to certain specifications.The updated article from PSI, which has previously shared a series of debunked climate change-related claims, carried a “correction” that stated: “Last month (December, 2020) WHO issued the following advice that masks are only of some benefit if used in conjunction with a range of other measures and of limited value.”It included a link to a WHO interim guidance document on “mask use in the context of COVID-19” from December 1, 2020, and a quote: “…the use of a mask alone, even when correctly used (see below), is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection for an uninfected individual or prevent onward transmission from an infected individual (source control).”While the article correctly quotes the document, it omits the preceding paragraph which gives added context to the word “alone”: “The use of masks is part of a comprehensive package of prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19.“Masks can be used for protection of healthy persons (worn to protect oneself when in contact with an infected individual) or for source control (worn by an infected individual to prevent onward transmission) or both.”The document as a whole provides a range of advice on the correct use of masks, including advice that the general public wear non-medical masks indoors as well as in outdoor settings where physical distancing couldn’t be maintained.The PSI article includes a further update, dated January 30, which cites comments from WHO executive director Michael Ryan from March 31, 2020, when he said: “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly.”Dr Ryan went on to say that there was “a massive global shortage” of masks and those most at risk were frontline health workers, adding: “The thought of them not having masks is horrific.”However, in June the WHO changed its advice, with Dr Tedros telling governments the general public should be encouraged to wear masks where there was widespread transmission and where physical distancing was difficult “in light of evolving evidence”.Since then, including in recent months, the organisation has consistently advocated for the use of masks among other measures to slow the spread of the virus.In his New Year message on December 30, for example, Dr Tedros said vaccines offered “great hope to turn the tide of the pandemic” but while rollouts were taking place people needed to follow “tried and tested measures that keep each and all of us safe”.“This means maintaining physical distance, wearing face masks, practicing hand and respiratory hygiene, avoiding crowded indoor places and meeting people outside,” he said.The WHO’s mask advice is backed up by Australian state authorities, with the New South Wales government advising: “NSW Health strongly encourages everyone to wear a mask when unable to physically distance, particularly in indoor settings.”A Victorian government COVID-19 advisory states: “Face masks are one of the most important ways we can help slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the community.“Wearing a fitted face mask protects both you and the people around you by reducing the movement of coronavirus (COVID-19), especially when indoors where ventilation is reduced. This two-way protection significantly reduces community transmission when more people wear face masks.”Several experts previously told AAP FactCheck that the purpose of mass masking was not to protect the wearer from infection but rather to slow or stop the spread of the virus.A January 2021 evidence review of mask-wearing to protect against COVID-19, published by the National Academy of Sciences and co-authored by 19 academics, found evidence “in favour of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission”.“When used in conjunction with widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining of anyone that may be infected, hand washing, and physical distancing, face masks are a valuable tool to reduce community transmission,” the review concluded.Similar posts claiming WHO said healthy people don’t need to wear a mask outside of a hospital have been debunked here, here and here. Masks should be part of protection measures used to suppress COVID-19, the WHO says.","https://archive.vn/olwAC,https://www.who.int/director-general,https://principia-scientific.com/who-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-mask/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210126095455/https://principia-scientific.com/who-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-mask/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210126072410/https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337199/WHO-2019-nCov-IPC_Masks-2020.5-eng.pdf,https://climatefeedback.org/outlet/principia-scientific/,https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337199/WHO-2019-nCov-IPC_Masks-2020.5-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/30/world/coronavirus-who-masks-recommendation-trnd/index.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52945210,https://www.who.int/news/item/30-12-2020-covid-19-anniversary-and-looking-forward-to-2021,https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/face-masks#:~:text=NSW%20Health%20strongly%20encourages%20everyone,or%20have%20chronic%20medical%20condition,https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/face-masks-importance-face-masks,https://www.aap.com.au/does-a-new-study-show-masks-are-ineffective-at-stopping-covid-19-infection/,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/01/fact-check-world-health-organization-who-did-not-say-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-mask.html?fbclid=IwAR3Ag_7sslnjqBaErAzNcC4I1ZDIvA9-Kwes82uNvtirG1I5wPdGAnZImMo,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/30/who-advises-people-continue-wearing-masks/4314055001/?fbclid=IwAR21OStEkeDn5n1zQMgaWtQ9AVrfJGRLl693pNgrkwo_Xw4S8JP4OoQZd5Q,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-masks-idUSKBN29X2S5",The WHO hasn’t ‘admitted’ healthy people should stop wearing masks,,,,,,
10,,,,True,,2021-02-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/are-renewables-the-cheapest-new-source-of-power/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is renewable energy the cheapest source of new power generation?The Statement“I think the lowest cost of new energy generation sources is renewable energy and that’s even when you add in the costs of firming, either with gas or batteries or pumped hydro, and that cost curve is only coming down.”Dave Sharma, Liberal Party MP, January 27, 2021.The AnalysisAs Australia debates the future of its energy network, a government MP has backed renewables as the cheapest source for new power capacity.Politicians have been debating the best source for additional electricity as AGL’s Liddell coal-fired power station in the Hunter Valley nears its scheduled closure date.Liberal Party leaders have said the government will build a new gas-fired power station if the private sector doesn’t step in, the Nationals have called for a new coal-fired power station, while the New South Wales government has said renewables would help make up the shortfall.However, when asked about the Nationals’ coal plan in an interview on Sky News on January 27, federal Liberal MP Dave Sharma backed renewable sources as the cheapest option.“I don’t think the jury is out on this. I think the lowest cost of new energy generation sources is renewable energy and that’s even when you add in the costs of firming either with gas or batteries or pumped hydro, and that cost curve is only coming down,” Mr Sharma said. “Coal, in fact, is going up because it is becoming less investible as an asset.” (video mark 1min15)AAP FactCheck examined Mr Sharma’s statement that renewables are the cheapest form of new power generation, even when accounting for the cost of firming.Firming is the term for the additional electricity generation or storage that is required to ensure a consistent supply of electricity when relying on intermittent sources like wind and solar. This is commonly achieved with backup battery storage, pumped hydro storage or gas-fuelled power, with firming costs typically increasing with the share of variable renewable generation in a network.When asked for a source for his statement, Mr Sharma’s office said it was based on the draft GenCost 2020-21 report, which was released for consultation in December.The annual report is produced by CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to estimate the costs of different forms of electricity generation and storage. A press release accompanying the draft said renewables remained the cheapest new-build sources of electricity.“Even taking into account (transmission and storage) costs, solar photovoltaics and wind continue to be the cheapest new sources of electricity for any expected share of renewables in the grid — anywhere from 50 per cent to 100 per cent,” CSIRO chief energy economist Paul Graham said in the statement.“This is projected to continue to be the case throughout the projection period to 2050.”The report modelled the “levelised” cost of renewables against gas, coal, nuclear, solar thermal or biomass alternatives.This accounted for additional costs associated with new renewable energy generation, including updating transmission infrastructure, and battery and pumped hydro storage for firming (page viii).It noted the modelling had been updated and was more accurate than the estimates in previous GenCost reports, which it said had overestimated the amount of storage needed for renewable generation (page 55).Under the report’s central scenario, new gas-fuelled power involved the lowest up-front cost in 2020 at $961 per kilowatt for a large open-cycle power station. Large-scale solar was priced at $1408 per kilowatt, while wind cost $1951. Black coal cost $4450 per kilowatt, brown coal was $6868 and power from a small modular nuclear reactor was $16,487. Solar with battery backup was $2139 per kilowatt (table B.1, page 63).However, when operating costs were factored in, renewables were cheaper than gas and coal with or without a carbon price (figure 5-3, page 56). Gas was estimated to cost between $68 and $115 per megawatt hour (MWh), while wind was estimated to cost $48 to $61/MWh and solar $46 to $68/MW (table B.9, page 72).Firming and transmission costs were not included in the 2020 figures but were added to cost projections for 2030 onwards. The report’s calculations assume no subsidies are applied to any of the technologies.The report explained there would be little or no requirement for additional storage capacity if variable renewable sources made up less than 50 per cent of total generation, so these costs were not included in the 2020 figures (page 53). In 2019, 21 per cent of the country’s electricity came from renewable sources.When firming and transmission costs were added to the 2030 projections, renewables were still the cheapest option. Figures provided to AAP FactCheck by CSIRO show renewables cost between $36 to $60/MWh when contributing 50 per cent of generation, and between $46 and $87/MWh when making up 90 per cent of generation.The cheapest form of fossil fuel generation was gas, which cost between $67 and $118/MWh. The cost of renewables with firming was predicted to be cheaper in 2030 than the same sources without firming in 2020 due to the expected decline in the prices for new solar and wind installations.The report explained that fossil fuel generation could also face higher costs in the future due to greenhouse gas emissions targets. These costs were accounted for by adding either a five per cent risk premium on borrowing costs, a carbon price or adding the cost of carbon capture and storage (pages 55-56), all of which would make fossil fuel-powered sources more expensive again.The modelling did not include all costs associated with variable renewable electricity as it said the costs for 2030 were on a “business as usual” basis, which estimated renewable generation would reach 34 per cent by 2030 (page 53). It also did not include the cost of reaching 50 per cent of renewable generation in Victoria by 2030 as the state already had a policy to achieve this, and those costs were considered business as usual (page 54).The findings of the report contrast with the previous GenCost 2019-20 report. Its modelling showed high-emission black coal- or gas-fuelled power was likely cheaper in 2020 than wind or solar power using either pumped hydro or two-hour battery storage for firming if there was no risk premium or carbon price added for fossil fuel generation (table B.8, page 45).Both wind and solar power with battery backup were predicted to be cheaper than all fossil fuel sources in 2030, however pumped hydro pushed the costs higher than black coal or gas. Gas remained cost-competitive even with a carbon price or risk premium factored in, however the addition of carbon capture and storage technology made renewables the cheapest option under all scenarios and timeframes.Australia National University Energy Change Institute director Kenneth Baldwin agreed wind and solar were the cheapest new-build sources for electricity generation.“Even when the need for additional battery/pumped hydro storage and for transmission infrastructure is taken into account to address variability, and the need for geographic diversity of renewable resources to ensure firm supply, wind and solar are still cheaper,” he told AAP FactCheck.“The cost of coal generation is also increasing due to the higher risk premium associated with greenhouse gas emissions. This can be reflected in a carbon price, or in the cost of carbon capture and storage, or in a risk premium reflecting the fact that the need to implement either or both of these measures through policy changes increases the cost of finance.”He cited a paper recently published in the journal Energy, which modelled how Australia could reach 100 per cent renewable energy in its electricity networks. It found the cost of renewable energy was lower than new-build coal or gas power even when accounting for the firming required to achieve the target (pages 8-9).Queensland University of Technology researcher Jeremy Webb recently published a paper titled The Future of Coal and Renewable Power Generation in Australia which found the levelised cost of solar and wind electricity was substantially lower than coal power.“Equally, battery storage is now certainly competitive with gas peaker plants up to four hours and, depending on the cost comparisons available, up to eight hours,” he told AAP FactCheck.“As noted, gas peaker plants are still needed for emergencies and exceptional climatic events, although only for brief periods.” Costs associated with renewable energy sources are falling.","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-02/agl-delays-defers-power-plant-closures-to-avoid-summer-blackouts/11377876,https://theconversation.com/morrison-government-threatens-to-use-snowy-hydro-to-build-gas-generator-as-it-outlines-gas-fired-recovery-plan-146154,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/03/nationals-coal-push-disrupts-scott-morrisons-climate-policy-pivot,https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/nsw-unveils-energy-superpower-vision-backed-by-batteries-20201107-p56cgm,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6226396775001,https://assets.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/documents/events/event-docs-2019/WIF19/Matt-Bruers-UPDATE.pdf,https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.csiro.au/~/media/News-releases/2020/renewables-cheapest/GenCost2020-21.pdf?la=en&hash=B2BC98D5AC4BED8BA6135BDF7E205CF49304870E,https://www.csiro.au/en/About,https://aemo.com.au/en/about/who-we-are,https://www.csiro.au/en/News/News-releases/2020/Renewables-still-the-cheapest-new-build-power-in-Australia,https://www.energy.gov.au/government-priorities/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-15/carbon-capture-process/2796006?nw=0#:~:text=Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage%20(CCS,does%20not%20enter%20the%20atmosphere.,https://publications.csiro.au/publications/publication/PIcsiro:EP201952,https://energy.anu.edu.au/about/people/academics/professor-kenneth-baldwin,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347959019_A_zero-carbon_reliable_and_affordable_energy_future_in_Australia,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Webb3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0313592620304318?dgcid=rss_sd_all",Are renewables the cheapest new source of power?,,,,,,
11,,,,Partly False,,2021-02-11,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/lithium-mining-meme-digs-itself-a-hole-with-deceptive-photo/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook meme, posted by a New Zealand user, shows an image of a large open-pit mine that the text suggests is used to produce lithium for electric car batteries.The text over the image reads, “Lithium mine. Because nothing says ‘I care for the planet’ like a battery powered car.”At the time of writing, the January 31 post had been viewed more than 160,000 times and shared more than 500 times. The meme was also shared by another NZ user, generating 15,000 views. A Facebook meme shows an image of a large open-pit mine. The AnalysisLithium is an essential element in the production of most electric car batteries – but the Facebook meme wrongly links its extraction to the pictured mine.A reverse image search reveals the mine photo has been used in articles from as early as 2011 to show one of the world’s largest copper mines, Escondida, located in northern Chile. The location in the photo matches geographic features visible in satellite imagery of the mine site.The giant copper mine has been misleadingly presented as a lithium mine here, here, here and here, while similar social media posts have been debunked here, here, here and here.Lithium is a soft metal that naturally occurs in igneous rocks and mineral springs. Among its main uses is the production of the high energy-density rechargeable lithium-ion batteries found in computers, smartphones and electric vehicles (EVs).Some lithium is extracted from open-cut mines like the image in the meme, while the remainder primarily comes from subsurface brines.No lithium mines are currently on the same scale as Escondida. Western Australia’s Greenbushes mine, the largest operating lithium mine in the world, spans around one-fifth the area of Escondida’s two main pits (page 12).The majority of global production comes from five mineral operations in Australia, two brine operations in Argentina and Chile, and two brine and a mineral operation in China, according to a US Geological Survey report from January.It said around 58 per cent of the world’s resources of the metal were located in Bolivia, Argentina and Chile – the so-called “Lithium Triangle” – however Australia accounted for about half of total global production in both 2019 and 2020.As the meme implies, there are concerns about the environmental cost of the large-scale lithium production required to make batteries for EVs.Jake Whitehead, an electric vehicle researcher at the University of Queensland, said while it was true that manufacturing EVs required more energy and produced more carbon dioxide emissions than making a fossil fuel-powered car, the long-term benefits swung the other way.“(It) depends on what energy is used to power the manufacturing facilities, and we are already seeing a significant uptake of low-carbon/renewable energy to support these operations around the world,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.Dr Whitehead added that “there is clear published evidence that in almost all cases electric vehicles have lower LCA (life cycle assessment) emissions” than traditional cars.A 2018 study by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that EVs were generally much cleaner than cars with internal combustion engines over their lifetimes, but manufacturing emissions – primarily from batteries – varied widely depending on production methods.A 2020 study, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, found EVs were less emissions-intensive in 53 world regions – representing 95 per cent of global transport.Alan Brent, a professor of sustainable energy systems at the University Victoria University of Wellington, told AAP FactCheck that he believed electric vehicles offered the more environmentally friendly transport option, although it was important to take a “total life cycle perspective” that factored in resource extraction and recycling.“As we move to more transparent supply chains – to ensure ethical and sustainability best practices – and improve the environmental impacts of the end-of-life phase, then I do think the benefits of EVs outweigh the negative aspects,” he said in an email.AAP FactCheck previously examined the comparative emissions from manufacturing an EV against a fossil-fuel powered car. Based on available research, most EVs required more greenhouse emissions to manufacture, but they emitted significantly less emissions over their lifetimes. The Escondida mine, in Chile’s Atacama Desert, is among the world’s biggest copper producers.","https://archive.is/ZAwZT,https://archive.is/wZItA,https://en.mercopress.com/2011/07/22/confirmed-copper-for-another-century-at-chile-s-main-escondida-mine,https://www.bhp.com/media-and-insights/image-gallery/locations-and-operations/escondida-chile/,https://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-the-10-biggest-copper-mines-in-the-world/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/BHP+Minera+Escondida/@-24.3441413,-69.0873015,9978a,35y,37.74t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x96a5f98787b698d9:0x6f12b4f3fe321ffa!8m2!3d-24.270757!4d-69.0718966,https://www.facebook.com/OilfieldAmerica/photos/a.105935236284416/553279191550016,https://www.facebook.com/joestreich2/posts/10158409735703962,https://www.facebook.com/AOT.Armstrong.Outfitters.Tackle/posts/3199742213459675,https://www.facebook.com/2atees1/photos/a.867280693463135/1201883156669552/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/19/fact-check-lithium-electric-cars-environment-oil-fossil-fuels/,https://factcheck.afp.com/meme-features-image-copper-mine-not-lithium-mine,https://factcheck.afp.com/misleading-photo-used-denounce-environmentalists-opposition-fracking,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lithium-mine-oil-sands/,https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/3/lithium,https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1371/pdf/circ1371_508.pdf,https://mineralseducationcoalition.org/minerals-database/lithium/,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/greenbushes-lithium-mine/#:~:text=Greenbushes%20lithium%20mine%20expansion&text=Conventional%20open%2Dcut%20method%20of,and%20up%20to%20450m%20depth.,https://www.bhp.com/-/media/bhp/documents/investors/reports/2012/121001_escondida-site-visit-presentation.pdf?la=en,https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-lithium.pdf,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/polp.12365,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16964,https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf,https://theicct.org,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0488-7,https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/alan.brent,https://www.aap.com.au/does-making-an-electric-car-use-twice-the-emissions-of-a-standard-model/",Lithium mining meme digs itself a hole with deceptive photo,,,,,,
12,,,,Somewhat True,,2021-02-10,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/is-australia-a-world-leader-in-renewable-energy-investment/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is Australia deploying renewable energy 10 times faster than the rest of the world?The Statement“We are a world leader in renewable energy investment, deploying wind and solar at 10 times the global per capita average.”Angus Taylor, Liberal MP and Energy Minister, September 22, 2020.The AnalysisEnergy Minister Angus Taylor has heralded Australia’s deployment of renewable energy as a success story in the country’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.In a National Press Club speech calling for a “technology-led approach” to reducing the nation’s carbon footprint, the Liberal MP said Australia had “done remarkably well in emissions reductions in recent years”.“We are a world leader in renewable energy investment, deploying wind and solar at 10 times the global per capita average,” he said in the September 2020 address.Similar claims have been repeated in multiple media statements from the minister, including in November 2020, December 2020 and February 2021, which have also favourably compared Australia’s rollout of renewable energy sources to those in Europe, the US and China.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Taylor’s statement that Australia is deploying wind and solar energy 10 times faster than the rest of the world on a per capita basis.When contacted for the source of the claim, the minister’s office referred to a Australian National University review of Australia’s renewable energy take-up from early September 2020.The review included the statement: “Australia is leading the world in per capita deployment of solar and wind,” it said“In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable energy 10 times faster per capita than the global average and four times faster per capita than in Europe, China, Japan or the USA.”The tenfold figure was based on total renewable energy capacity, including sources such as hydro power, while Mr Taylor’s Press Club statement singled out wind and solar capacity.Andrew Blakers, a professor of engineering at ANU and one of the review’s authors, told AAP FactCheck the figures were based on data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).Prof Blakers said the researchers used IRENA data on the total renewable energy deployed per country and divided this by Worldometer population data to calculate new renewable energy per capita.Australia added 6096 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy between 2018 and 2019, or around 242 watts (W) per person based on the IRENA figures and the country’s estimated population in 2019.That compared to an increase of 175,792MW in renewable energy capacity worldwide, or less than 23W per person – more than 10 times lower than Australia’s per capita figure.When just solar and wind energy capacity was used, Australia’s per capita renewable energy deployment was nearly 12 times the rate worldwide.The ANU review also showed Australia’s per-person deployment rate for solar and wind energy outpaced that in the US, Germany, Japan and Europe-wide in both 2018 and 2019 (figure 2).However, John Quiggin, a professor of economics at the University of Queensland who has written extensively about climate policy, said comparing Australia’s renewable energy deployment to the rest of the world was a “cherry-picked statistic”.“Global per-capita average is not very relevant since people in poor countries have less of everything, including all kinds of energy,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.According to figures from the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity consumption per capita worldwide was 3.3 megawatt-hours (MWh) in 2018, while in Australia it was 9.9 MWh – three times higher.Murdoch University academic chair of environmental engineering  Martin Anda and associate professor of engineering and energy discipline Tania Urmee told AAP FactCheck in a joint email that other developed countries, like Germany, were also “much further along in the move to renewable energy”.“Australia started from a very low base when it comes to renewable energy, so it is easy to obtain a high growth rate,” they said.An analysis of IEA figures for 2019 shows less than 19 per cent of Australia’s electricity generation came from hydro, wind and solar sources, against more than 32 per cent in Germany, which also produces a large share of its power from nuclear plants.Associate professor Mark Diesendorf, an expert in renewable energy technology from UNSW Sydney, called Mr Taylor’s claim “misleading in the context”.Dr Diesendorf said while Australia may be deploying new renewable energy at a high rate, it still lagged many other countries in overall renewable energy generation.“Denmark is generating about two-thirds of its electricity from renewables – non-hydro renewables – and it has a population a fifth of Australia, so their per capita annual generation is many times that of Australia, and similarly for Scotland,” he said.Australia ranked among the top 10 countries for total installed capacity from solar and wind in 2019, according to an IRENA comparison, however that only came after large increases in capacity in recent years.Between 2017 and 2019, Australia’s capacity from solar and wind generation jumped more than 90 per cent, compared to a 34 per cent increase worldwide, an analysis of the IRENA figures shows.But between 2013 and 2017, global capacity rose more than 105 per cent, compared to a 56 per cent increase in Australia.Nevertheless, Prof Blakers said it was wrong to argue that Australia was coming off a low base for renewable energy capacity as it now had the highest per capita amount of solar power and would soon be “among the global leaders” for installed wind capacity.“Government quarterly emissions data shows that this solar and wind is reducing Australian emissions, and has the potential to dramatically reduce emissions at low cost in the future if we installed solar and wind even faster than at present,” he said. Australia is among the world’s top 10 nations for installed wind and solar capacity.","https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/speeches/national-press-club-address-energising-economy-case-technology-led,https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/australia-beats-2020-target-459-million-tonnes,https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/projections-confirm-australia-track-meet-and-beat-2030-target,https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/australia-sets-new-renewables-records-2020,https://energy.anu.edu.au/files/2020%2009%2003%20-%20Austalia%20the%20global%20renewable%20energy%20pathfinder%20-%20Andrew%20Blakers%2C%20Ken%20Baldwin%2C%20Matthew%20Stocks.pdf,https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/blakers-aw,https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Mar/IRENA_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2020.pdf,https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/australia-population/,https://economics.uq.edu.au/profile/2249/john-quiggin,https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=WORLD&fuel=Energy%20consumption&indicator=ElecConsPerCapita,http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/martin-anda/,http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/tania-urmee/,https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=AUSTRALI&fuel=Energy%20supply&indicator=ElecGenByFuel,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-mark-diesendorf,https://public.tableau.com/shared/TQSXHNN4C?:toolbar=n&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y,https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Mar/IRENA_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2020.pdf",Is

13,,,,False,,2021-02-05,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/misreading-of-who-guidance-on-pcr-tests-produces-false-results/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post claims the World Health Organization (WHO) released guidance that included an admission PCR tests for COVID-19 were producing inaccurate results due to earlier testing approaches.The Facebook post by a New Zealand user, who described herself as a “TV medium and healer”, includes a screenshot of a January 21 tweet which reads: “The World Health Organization has now released guidance to laboratories around the world to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases. The current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.”At the time of writing, the January 23 post had generated more than 140 shares, 160 reactions and 15,000 views. A post claims WHO released guidance admitting PCR tests were producing inaccurate results. The AnalysisThe tweet in the Facebook post wrongly claims that the WHO told laboratories to “reduce the cycle count” of PCR tests because current methods were leading to false positive results. In fact, the WHO notice called for “careful interpretation” of weak positive results but included no advice about reducing cycles.The original tweet, from urologist and Newsmax pundit David Samadi, no longer appears on Twitter, however multiple screenshots of the post have been shared elsewhere on social media (see example here).The term “cycle counts” refers to the cycle threshold (Ct) used in PCR tests. This represents the number of times a sample has been amplified before a positive case is detected in a laboratory.A low Ct value indicates the sample being tested contains a high concentration of viral material, typically linked to a high risk that a person is infectious, according to a Public Health England guide. High values point to low viral concentrations and infectivity – although this may not be true in cases that were detected early.A high Ct value does not indicate that a false positive has been generated – only that a low viral load is present in the patient.The WHO guidance from January 20 addressed instances of diagnostic testing where weak positive results occurred and “where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation”.It included a note that the “cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load” but contained no other references to test cycles other than advice that testers provide Ct values in their reports to health providers.Joshua Freeman, who is clinical director of microbiology at Canterbury District Health Board, told AAP FactCheck via email: “The notice from the WHO was a reminder to laboratories using commercial PCR tests to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.“In particular the WHO highlights in this notice that weak positive results (high Ct values) in low prevalence settings need to be interpreted cautiously.”The WHO guidance includes a warning to PCR test users that “as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positives increases”. Disease prevalence is the share of the overall population infected with the virus.Dr Freeman said the WHO “did not make a blanket recommendation to ‘reduce the cycle count'” as claimed in the tweet.“Rather, the WHO advised reporting of Ct values to the requesting health care provider as an aid to interpretation and most importantly adherence to the manufacturer’s instructions for use,” he said.Dr Freeman added there was “no evidence” to support the second claim suggesting tests that used high Ct cycles were returning large numbers of false positives.“If anything, the bigger issue described in the scientific literature has been false negative results, primarily in patients presenting to hospital with severe respiratory illness,” he said.AAP FactCheck previously debunked claims that PCR tests were delivering high numbers of false positives and that this was rendering reported case numbers meaningless. A Public Health Ontario analysis of test results, published in September, found a false positive rate of less than 0.01 per cent, although it noted the risk of false positives increased where prevalence was low.Alexander Khromykh, an associate professor of virology at the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck one of the factors that could contribute to interpretation of the PCR test was its timing.“As virus infection is a dynamic process, low PCR positivity (high Ct values) early in infection can become high PCR positivity (low CT values) later in infection,” Dr Khromykh said.“Clinical presentation therefore would be another measure that needs to be considered for the timing when to perform the test.”He pointed to another line in the WHO guidance that touched on this point. It advised: “Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology.”Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago, said the tweet was “misinformation” that did not accurately represent the content of the WHO communication.“The WHO notification is reminding people that you have to interpret the testing results in the context in which the specimen is collected,” he said during a phone interview with AAP FactCheck.“The high Ct value may correspond to someone who’s had historic infection and is no longer infectious, for instance. So I think it would be good practice to start recording that information so that we’ll get a better understanding as to whether it corresponds, in any way, to someone’s level of infectivity.” A healthcare worker collect a swab sample for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.","https://archive.is/GXMCU,https://web.archive.org/web/20210121094323/https://twitter.com/drdavidsamadi/status/1352189984867016705,https://www.roboticoncology.com/urologist/,https://www.davidsamadi.com/video/newsmax/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%40drdavidsamadi%20The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20has%20now%20released%20guidance%20to%20laboratories%20around%20the%20world%20to%20reduce%20the%20cycle%20count%20in%20PCR%20tests%20to%20get%20a%20more%20accurate%20representation%20of%20COVID%20cases.%20%20The%20current%20cycle%20was%20much%20too%20high%20and%20resulting%20in%20any%20particle%20being%20declared%20a%20positive%20case.&src=typed_query&f=live,http://archive.vn/2gKFF,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf,https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05,https://www.chl.co.nz/home/leadership-team,https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html#:~:text=Prevalence%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to%20as,a%20specified%20period%20of%20time.,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-false-positives-dont-make-case-figures-meaningless/,https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/alexander-khromykh,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024831.html",Misreading of WHO guidance on PCR tests produces false results,,,,,,
14,,,,Satire,,2021-02-04,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/dihydrogen-monoxide-hoax-returns-in-social-media-meme/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims high levels of “dihydrogen monoxide” have been found in bottled water left lingering on supermarket shelves.The January 30 post, from a user in New Zealand, features an image of rows of water in plastic bottles in a store.A caption written over the image reads: “WATER BOTTLES STORED ON GROCERY STORE SHELVES FOR MORE THAN ONE MONTH … HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTAIN VERY HIGH LEVELS OF DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE.”At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 55 times and attracted more than 95 comments and 25,000 views. A Facebook post claims “very high levels of dihydrogen monoxide” have been found in bottled water. The AnalysisBottled water is a big global industry, worth hundreds of billions of dollars in sales each year. But the drinks industry isn’t covering up a sinister secret about its products containing dangerous levels of a possibly toxic chemical.The term “dihydrogen monoxide” literally means “two hydrogen, one oxygen” and it is one of several little-known descriptors for water, which has the chemical formula H2O. Other chemical names for water include oxidane and dihydrogen oxide.The Facebook post is a variation on the decades-old dihydrogen monoxide parody, which is so persistent that DHMO now has its own website and Wikipedia page. Related hoaxes often involve calls for the ominous-sounding chemical to be banned or regulated, linking it to dire events like drowning deaths and acid rain.In 1999, fact-checking website Snopes debunked a claim that ‘”dihydrogen monoxide is a dangerous chemical that should be banned”. It noted the hoax showed “even the most innocuous of substances can be made to sound like a dangerous threat to human life”.The parody reportedly dates back to as early as 1983, when an April Fool’s Day edition of Michigan’s Durand Express newspaper is said to have warned residents that dihydrogen monoxide had been found in the city’s water pipes. The hoax was reportedly repeated in 1990 at the University of California, where two students publicised the dangers of DHMO.In 1997, a 14-year-old student in Idaho gave 50 of his fellow students a report titled “Dihydrogen Monoxide: The Unrecognised Killer” for his school science fair project, according to the Washington Post.The report accurately laid out the dangers of DHMO, including that it had been linked to the deaths of thousands of Americans through accidental ingestion, while in gas form it could cause serious burns.On the back of the report, 43 of the group – or 86 per cent of respondents – voted to ban the compound due to its deadly nature. The student was reported to have won the grand prize at the regional science fair for his project, titled: “How Gullible Are We?”In 2004, city officials in Aliso Viejo were left red-faced after a staff report to the local council highlighted the dangers posed by the chemical, which was said to “threaten human health and safety”.New Zealand National Party MP Jacqui Dean was caught out by the hoax in 2007 after an online blogger asked for her help in banning dihydrogen monoxide, the Oamaru Herald reported.A letter, signed by Mrs Dean, was sent to associate health minister Jim Anderton, asking if the government’s Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs had a view on banning the “drug”.Mr Anderton responded to Mrs Dean’s letter, saying: “Thank you for your letter of 23 August, 2007 about your constituent call for the ban on dihydrogen monoxide, (but) dihydrogen monoxide is water.“It may have been described to you as colourless, odourless, tasteless and causing the death of uncounted thousands of people every year … (but) I had to respond that the experts had no intention of (banning water).”Mrs Dean was not the only Kiwi to call for a ban on DHMO. In 2001, a staff member in Green MP Sue Kedgley’s office responded to a request to back the campaign against DHMO by saying Ms Kedgley would “be absolutely supportive of the campaign to back this toxic substance”, the New Zealand Press Association reported.In 2016, Waikato Regional Council was forced to reassure locals that a chemical spill warning circulating on social media about dihydrogen monoxide was a hoax. The warning said hundreds of thousands of litres of DHMO had drained into the Waikato River and it could be fatal if breathed into the lungs, a Radio New Zealand (RNZ) article said.The warning was reportedly shared hundreds of times by locals, with some commenters becoming angry and calling for a quick clean-up and huge fines. The decades-old dihydrogen monoxide parody is so notorious it has its own Wikipedia page.","https://archive.vn/2UFsU,https://www.statista.com/outlook/20010000/100/bottled-water/worldwide,https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax.html,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Water#section=Depositor-Supplied-Synonyms&fullscreen=true,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody,http://dhmo.org/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dangers-dihydrogen-monoxide/,https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96076834/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/75591065/water-hoax-hits-waikato,http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2006/05/17/1631494.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1997/10/21/dihydrogen-monoxide-unrecognized-killer/ee85631a-c426-42c4-bda7-ed63db993106/,https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-mar-13-me-water13-story.html,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/mp-tries-to-ban-water/XM4GJ7XG3WC4ANBIFP2IVFNANE/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/38005/National-MP-falls-victim-to-water-hoax,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/293410/water-hoax-comes-back-around,https://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/75591065/water-hoax-hits-waikato",‘Dihydrogen monoxide’ hoax returns in social media meme,,,,,,
15,,,,False,,2021-02-01,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/experts-pour-cold-water-on-warm-water-health-benefits/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims drinking cold water can cause cancer and heart attacks.The January 15 post, shared by Fijian users, makes several claims regarding the health effects of drinking cold water, including that it “closes 4 veins of the heart and causes heart attack; cold drinks are the main reason for heart attacks” and “affects the stomach and big intestine and results in cancer”.It goes on to claim that, conversely, drinking warm water is “100 per cent effective in resolving some health problems, including high blood pressure, low blood pressure, sudden increasing and decreasing of heartbeat, epilepsy, whooping cough, also all related diseases to the eyes, ear & throat”, amongst other benefits.Variations of the post’s claims have been shared widely around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. A Facebook post claims that drinking cold water can cause cancer and heart attacks. The AnalysisDrinking cold water will not cause heart attacks or lead to cancer in the stomach and intestines, according to experts.Variations of the claim that drinking cold water leads to similar potentially deadly outcomes have circulated on the internet since at least 2006.Water is an essential part of sustaining human life, assisting the body with hydration, digestion, absorption of nutrients, movement and regulation of temperature, the Australian government’s healthdirect website says.Dr Yutang Wang, a lecturer in life sciences and a specialist in cardiovascular diseases from Federation University, told AAP FactCheck there are no scientific studies to support  claims that drinking cold water will close the heart’s veins, causing heart attacks.“The main underlying reason for heart attack is plaque (atherosclerosis) build-up in the arteries. When the dislodged plaque gets stuck in an artery and blocks the supply of blood to the heart, a heart attack occurs,” he said in an email.The Heart Foundation says the most common cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease, which stems from the build-up of plaque. Risk factors include unhealthy eating, being overweight or physically inactive, and smoking, as well as age, gender and family history.Other causes of heart attacks include severe spasms in the coronary artery or tearing of the artery wall.“Heart attacks can be triggered by many sudden stress situations including anger, heatwave, intense physical activity, infection, and others. However, drinking cold water has not been reported to be a trigger for heart attack,” Dr Wang said.A spokesperson for the Heart Foundation told AAP FactCheck in an email that the organisation was not aware of a substantive body of evidence that showed drinking cold water could cause heart attacks.One case report published in the US National Institute of Health’s National Library of Medicine details the death of a 12-year-old boy from cardiac arrhythmia – as distinct from a heart attack – after quickly ingesting a frozen slurry.Dr Wang said that while rapid ingestion of a frozen drink could potentially be a trigger for heart problems, the incident rate was very low.For the claim that drinking cold water leads to cancer, Clare Hughes, the chair of Cancer Council Australia’s physical activity and nutrition committee told AAP FactCheck there is no evidence that drinking cold water increases your risk of cancer, including stomach and intestinal (bowel) cancer.“While there has been no evidence linking cancer to water consumption generally, there is some evidence that consuming hot liquids (e.g. beverages, soups and broths) above 65C probably increases the risk of oesophageal cancer because it can irritate the oesophageal lining,” Ms Hughes said in an email.“The contribution that drinking very hot liquids makes to Australia’s oesophageal cancer rates is not clear. This advice is not specific to water but all hot liquids above 65C.”Luigi Fontana, a professor of medicine and nutrition from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck that he was not aware of any studies that showed drinking hot water was effective in preventing or treating any condition – although there were clear benefits in drinking water in general.“(In relative terms), drinking water is much better than drinking soda or juice fruits for the prevention of obesity and related chronic diseases,” Prof Fontana said in a phone interview.Variations of the cold and warm water claims have been debunked here and here. Drinking water is good for your health – but there are no clear benefits to making it hot.","https://www.facebook.com/feyinspire/posts/680761729262680,https://archive.is/3E7Yi,https://archive.is/hSIcd,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/drinking-cold-water-meals-cause-cancer/,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/drinking-water-and-your-health,https://federation.edu.au/schools/school-of-science-psychology-and-sport/staff-profiles/biomedical-science/wang,-yutang-dr,https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/conditions/heart-attack,https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/Conditions/Coronary-heart-disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10208334/,https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different,https://www.cancer.org.au/about-us/news-and-media/spokespeople,https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/luigi-fontana.html,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-much-water-should-you-drink,https://factcheck.afp.com/cancer-experts-around-world-say-claim-has-no-scientific-basis,https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/health/fact-check-post-claiming-that-drinking-cold-water-after-meals-can-cause-cancer-is-fake/",Experts pour cold water on warm water ‘health benefits’,,,,,,
16,,,,False,,2021-02-01,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-nature-alone-control-global-carbon-dioxide-levels/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAustralian senator Malcolm Roberts has claimed that nature – not mankind – is solely responsible for the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.In a lengthy Facebook post on January 18 to his more than 64,000 followers, the One Nation representative made a range of unsourced claims disputing that CO2 was a pollutant.“Nature alone controls the level of CO2 in earth’s air,” Mr Roberts’ post said. “Empirical scientific data proves this.”Mr Roberts has long denied humans are causing climate change and has advanced various conspiracy theories relating to global warming. One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts claims in a lengthy post that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. The AnalysisDecades of scientific study into the level and make-up of atmospheric CO2 has shown that man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels have been rapidly accumulating and causing the planet to warm, in contradiction of Mr Roberts’ claims.The One Nation senator’s office did not respond to emails from AAP FactCheck asking for the basis of his statement.The latest figures from NASA showed atmospheric CO2 levels had reached 415 parts per million (ppm) in December 2020, the highest level in at least 800,000 years.Direct measurements of CO2 levels are collected from sites such as the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which has the longest record with measurements dating back to 1958. Dozens of sites around the world, including in Australia and New Zealand, collate regular readings.Earlier records of CO2 levels have been developed from ice cores, which contain bubbles of air trapped in ice providing a record dating back 800,000 years.Together, these records show a marked increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere since industrialisation, with the current concentration of the gas around 38 per cent higher than its previous pre-industrial peak.University of New South Wales climate scientist and professor Matthew England said Mr Roberts’ statement was “totally false”.“It’s as false as saying the Earth is flat or that pigs fly backwards,” Prof England said.“We can precisely measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to human activity, it is irrefutable. The natural pre-industrial level was 280ppm. Today it is over 400ppm due to human activity.“That’s the highest it’s been for at least the last 800,000 years. It’s basic physics and chemistry.”An article on the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website said that over the past 60 years CO2 levels had increased about 100 times faster than during previous natural increases, and this was “mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy”.It described CO2, which warms the Earth by absorbing and radiating heat, as the most important, long-lived greenhouse gas as it was more abundant and stayed in the atmosphere longer than other gases such as methane or nitrous oxide.Because of this, CO2 was responsible for “about two-thirds of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth’s temperature to rise”.On its website, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says natural planetary cycles could not explain the large increases in atmospheric CO2.“Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, with contributions from cement manufacture, are responsible for more than 75 per cent of the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration since pre-industrial times,” it says.“The remainder of the increase comes from land use changes dominated by deforestation (and associated biomass burning) with contributions from changing agricultural practices. All these increases are caused by human activity.”Victoria University of Wellington professor Martin Manning, who has contributed to IPCC reports, said claims such as those from Mr Roberts had been rebutted multiple times.“This is ignoring the multiple lines of evidence from ice cores and tree rings that the atmospheric level of CO2 was quite stable for thousands of years after the last ice age ended,” he said.“But then (it) increased rapidly over the last 200 years at the same time as the industrial revolution led to increasing use of fossil fuels. Natural processes continue, but we add to them and have pushed the global carbon cycle out of equilibrium.”An article on NASA’s Earth Observatory website explained how the clearing of forests and burning of fossil fuels has put the carbon cycle out of balance.“So far, land plants and the ocean have taken up about 55 per cent of the extra carbon people have put into the atmosphere while about 45 per cent has stayed in the atmosphere,” it said.“Eventually, the land and oceans will take up most of the extra carbon dioxide, but as much as 20 per cent may remain in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.”Prof Manning said research applying radiocarbon dating to CO2 was developed in the 1950s and this showed increased CO2 largely came from burning fossil fuels as the carbon in the atmosphere was getting “older” each year.“This was because the added carbon was coming from fossil sources, so the added carbon was about 600 million years older than what is in the atmosphere naturally,” he said.The NOAA explains that CO2 from fossil fuels, which are millions of years old, does not contain the isotope carbon-14 as it decays over time.However, carbon emitted naturally from “young sources” – such as forests and oceans – does contain carbon-14, making it possible to use the isotope to gauge the extent to which humans are contributing to the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.A decline in the proportion of the isotope carbon-13 in the atmosphere has also been linked to the increase in CO2 from burning fossil fuels.CSIRO Climate Science Centre chief research scientist and Global Carbon Project executive director Pep Canadell said nature has a large impact on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but natural carbon sinks, such as oceans and forests, can’t keep up with the amount of CO2 humans are producing by burning fossil fuels.“If one day we were to decide to stop emitting CO2, nature would take care and move all that excess CO2 in the atmosphere into various compartments of the Earth,” Dr Canadell said.“The sting in the tail is that it would take tens of thousands of years for nature to do so – 1,000 years to remove 80 per cent, and then tens of thousands to remove the rest – not too helpful for the next unprecedented bushfire season or round of heatwaves.” Emissions from burning fossil fuels have caused a major increase in global CO2 levels, experts say.","https://archive.vn/wullt,https://theconversation.com/one-nation-climate-denial-and-those-jewish-bankers-62176,https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/,https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/mlo.html#mlo,https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/iadv/?map_program=ccgg,https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/our-data/publication/ice-cores-and-climate-change/,https://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/BAMS_SOTC_2019_co2_paleo_1000px.jpg,https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/matthew-england,https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide#:~:text=Global%20atmospheric%20carbon%20dioxide%20was,2019%2C%20a%20new%20record%20high.&text=The%20annual%20rate%20of%20increase,age%2011%2C000%2D17%2C000%20years%20ago.,https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-7-1.html,https://www.scimex.org/experts?name=martin-manning&a=11729,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle,https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/isotopes/c14tracer.html,https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/isotopes/c13tellsus.html,https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/Climate-Science-Centre,https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/about/,https://people.csiro.au/C/P/Pep-Canadell",Does ‘nature alone’ control global carbon dioxide levels?,,,,,,
17,,,,False,,2021-01-29,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-covid-19-vaccines-dont-cause-sterility/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook meme shared by an Australian user claims that “becoming sterile is almost a certainty” for those who receive a COVID-19 vaccination.“Get the COVID Vaccine but remember the following,” reads the January 23 post. It goes on to list 11 points, which includes a claim that vaccines “(have a) 10-15% chance of adverse effects and increase risk of HIV”.The post finishes by saying, “Congratulations! You’re immunised…against a virus you had 99.9% chance of surviving.”At the bottom of the post is an attribution to the Twitter handle for Rashid. A Buttar, a former army surgeon and promoter of conspiracy theories. He also posted the meme on Facebook, attracting more than 250 shares at the time of writing. A meme claims “becoming sterile is almost a certainty” for those who receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The AnalysisThere is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in countries such as Australia or the United States will result in sterility, with a number of women involved in clinical trials conceiving after receiving the treatments.In the United States, the first COVID-19 vaccine granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate on December 11, 2020 with an EUA granted to the Moderna vaccine candidate on December 18.Australia’s health regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), gave provisional approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in January. It is due to be rolled out in February, while the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate continues to undergo review.The claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility in women has been advanced by German physician Wolfgang Wodarg and Michael Yeadon, a former Pfizer employee, who asked Europe’s health regulator, the European Medicines Agency, to delay clinical trials and approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.The pair claimed the vaccine would induce the formation of antibodies against proteins such as syncytin-1, which is involved in the development of the placenta in humans.However, Dr Alex Polyakov, a fertility specialist from Melbourne IVF and a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck there is “absolutely zero evidence” that COVID-19 vaccines have any impact on fertility.“I don’t see a physiological way for the vaccines to have any impact. All the vaccines do is create immunity to the virus so it interacts with the immune system, but it doesn’t really interact with the reproductive system,” he said in a phone interview.Dr Polyakov said there is evidence to suggest that a severe COVID-19 infection could affect sperm count in men, but it is unclear at this stage whether this is a permanent issue.“You could argue that vaccinating against COVID and preventing infection with the virus would save the male fertility,” he said.“The vaccine development was very quick and to assess someone’s fertility takes at least six months to a year and that simply hasn’t been done. So there is no evidence at this point that vaccines have any effect (on fertility) at all, and I think it’s extremely unlikely.”In a television interview, Dr Mark Trolice, the director of Florida-based Fertility CARE and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, described the claim as baseless.“There was a scientist in Germany that suggested there was a similarity in the genes of the COVID virus and the cells that make the placenta. There is minimal, if (any) similarity, and the vaccine is not directed at that gene protein anyway,” he said.In Pfizer’s vaccine trial, four pregnancies were reported in women who received the immunisation before their last period (page 41), while two pregnancies were reported in women who received the immunisation before their last period during Moderna’s trial (page 45). Both results were in line with results in the placebo groups.In a fact sheet, Pfizer said there was no data to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine caused infertility.“It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is partly shared with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1,” it said.“From a scientific perspective, the differences between the two sequences are quite significant, making it very unlikely our vaccine could generate a response that would harm the placenta.”AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and infertility. Similar posts have been debunked by fact checkers here, here, here, here and here.The claim of a 10 to 15 per cent chance of adverse effects stemming from the vaccines has been previously examined. Experts told AAP FactCheck that regulators focus on the incidence of serious adverse events, particularly those that could potentially be life-threatening, rather than the total number of adverse events – which are mainly mild and transient, commonly involving symptoms such as pain at the injection site.Moderna reported five serious adverse events related to the vaccine out of more than 15,000 recipients (page 32). Pfizer reported three serious adverse events related to the vaccine out of more than 18,000 recipients (page 40). There were three severe adverse events reported as being possibly related to the AstraZeneca vaccine from more than 12,000 recipients.The Facebook post also lists a previously debunked claim overestimating the survival rate for those who become infected with COVID-19. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility, experts say.","https://archive.vn/lZ9uG,https://twitter.com/DrButtar,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-about-covid-tests-and-famous-new-zealand-visitors/,https://archive.vn/9u82D,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#abouteuas,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-vaccine#:~:text=On%20December%2018%2C%202020%2C%20the,SARS%2DCoV%2D2,https://www.tga.gov.au/media-release/tga-provisionally-approves-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/about-covid-19-vaccines/about-the-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.tga.gov.au/tga-grants-provisional-determination-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.wodarg.com/,https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6KRy4L1ujfYJ:https://s56fbd84d0e131e9b.jimcontent.com/download/version/1606870652/module/9033912514/name/Wodarg_Yeadon_EMA_Petition_Pfizer_Trial_FINAL_01DEC2020_signed_with_Exhibits_geschw%25C3%25A4rzt.pdf+&cd=9&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au,https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210112/why-covid-vaccines-are-falsely-linked-to-infertility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333240/,https://www.mivf.com.au/specialists/melbourne-ivf-doctors/dr-alex-polyakov,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/772397-alex-polyakov,https://watch.thewest.com.au/show/419736,https://myfertilitycare.com/mark-trolice-md/,https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download,https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-vaccine-whistleblower-information-sounds-a-lot-like-an-unrelated-study-from-1989/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/14/fact-check-no-evidence-covid-19-vaccine-causes-infertility-women/3884328001/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/10/blog-posting/no-pfizers-head-research-didnt-say-covid-19-vaccin/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9856420671,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://factcheck.afp.com/covid-19-vaccine-not-shown-cause-female-sterilization,https://www.aap.com.au/misleading-post-sows-doubt-on-safety-of-moderna-vaccine-trial/,https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download,https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-facts101-marked-d-for-deceptive/","No, COVID-19 vaccines don’t cause sterility",,,,,,
18,,,,False,,2021-01-29,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/has-there-really-been-no-warming-of-the-planet-in-22-years/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Has there been no warming of the planet in the past 22 years?The Statement“According to this graph, there has been no net warming in the last 22 years.”Rowan Dean, Sky News host, January 19, 2021.The AnalysisSky News host Rowan Dean has questioned the evidence for climate change, citing temperatures drawn from satellite data to claim there has been no global warming.However, experts say Mr Dean’s apparent “cherry-picking” approach misrepresents the climate data and relies on figures that don’t properly gauge worldwide temperature changes.In a segment on January 19, Mr Dean – who has previously called climate change “the biggest hoax of them all” – claimed climate activists had “disappeared under the doona” during a cool Australian summer, going on to question whether global temperatures were increasing.” … according to this graph, there has been no net warming in the last 22 years,” he told viewers.Mr Dean then pointed to another graph which he said showed the planet had cooled by half a degree in the last 12 months. AAP FactCheck previously fact-checked that claim from Liberal MP Craig Kelly as false.AAP FactCheck analysed Mr Dean’s statement that data showed there had been no net warming of the Earth in the past 22 years.Mr Dean did not respond to emails asking for the basis of his statement. However, in the Sky News segment he said the claim was based on figures from US agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The graph Mr Dean referred to shows satellite temperature data for the lower atmosphere developed by researchers at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).The NOAA publishes a record of this temperature data, which it describes as taken in the lower troposphere – or the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere.These figures showed temperatures in 1998 and 2020 were close to the same. There was a spike in global temperatures in 1998, which was 0.48C warmer than the 1981-2010 average, used as a baseline. In 2020, the temperature was 0.49C warmer than the baseline.However, this comparison does not show that there has been no net global warming since 1998.The same data reveals temperatures have steadily increased since 1979 when longer-term trends are compared. Comparing five-year averages, from 1994 to 1998 and 2016 to 2020, shows a significant rise, from an anomaly of 0.094C above baseline in 1994-98 to 0.418C in 2016-20.The 10-year average shows temperatures from 1989-1998 were -0.019C below baseline, while 2011-2020 temperatures were 0.275C above baseline.Pep Canadell, chief research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre and executive director of the Global Carbon Project, said the climate varied significantly year to year and Mr Dean had seemingly cherry-picked two dates.“This type of comparison has been used by sceptics forever,” Dr Canadell said via email.“Picking the highest single year maximum temperature and then the lowest single year for a period of time, and making any type of statement is a nonsense when we know the climate varies a lot year to year. That is why we take multi-decadal trends to make any statements as to whether the climate is changing.”He said the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle had a very strong effect on a single year of temperatures, and 1998 was considered a “super El Niño”, producing exceptionally hot weather.“The underlying trend is what defines climate. I think any person looking at the graph would reach the conclusion that the climate is warming.”The World Meteorological Organization said 2020 was one of the three warmest years on record, based on the Earth’s average surface temperature, and the last decade was the warmest on record.Victoria University of Wellington physical geography professor James Renwick, who has been involved with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for several years, agreed the UAH data showed a clear warming trend.However, Prof Renwick said the UAH satellite series was an estimate of temperatures in the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere based on atmospheric radiation measurements and it was “fraught with errors“.“The reason the UAH dataset crops up so much in the denialist community is because it is the temperature data set that shows the least warming. But it is one of the least reliable. The curators of the data, Roy Spencer and John Christy, are well-known climate change sceptics.”Dr Spencer has written a number of books that include claims greenhouse gas emissions are not the main cause of global warming and argue against action to curb emissions, while Dr Christy has also questioned man-made climate change.Prof Renwick pointed to satellite data compiled by a different group of researchers, called RSS, which showed atmospheric warming was even greater than surface warming, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.A comparison of the UAH and RSS satellite data shows the latter identified a greater warming trend after 1998. Based on the RSS figures, 2020 was 0.638C above the baseline temperature, while in 1998 the anomaly was 0.421C.Prof Renwick said surface temperature records taken with land- and ship-based thermometers were generally more reliable than satellite data, and they showed more marked warming.NASA also said surface temperatures were more accurate than satellite data as satellites measured the brightness of Earth’s atmosphere to establish temperature and required complex modelling.Australian National University Climate Change Institute director and IPCC vice chair Mark Howden said there were four main sources of global temperature data: NOAA, University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit, NASA and Berkley Earth and all showed sustained and rapid warming since the 1970s.“These reliable records show that the statement that there has been no warming over the past 22 years is simply wrong,” Prof Howden said.He said a strong El Niño in 1998 contributed to a new record global temperature of about 0.6C above the 1951-1980 baseline at the time. Averages from the four sources put the temperature for 2020 at around 0.92C above the baseline.“Even relatively cool recent years such as 2018 are significantly warmer than 1998. More importantly, there is a clear and highly significant statistical trend upwards in temperature around which year-by-year temperatures vary. It is this trend which is important, not cherry-picking two years for comparison.“The warming trend is exactly what science has predicted since the first measurements were made in the 1850s of the effects of greenhouse gases on radiative transfer.”Prof Howden said the UAH satellite data “is not a robust measurement of global surface temperatures”.“The problems with relying on satellite measures of temperature alone are well-known – at least since the late 1990s. For such an important topic, it is critical that discussions use the latest and most robust information and appropriate ways of interpreting this.”He said arbitrarily choosing two dates to demonstrate a trend while ignoring all other information has been referred to as the “going down the up escalator“.“Statements such as ‘there has been no warming since 1998’ is a commonly occurring myth in some social media and other groups which keeps on getting trotted out against the evidence, and no amount of expert debunking or common sense seems to stop it.” Data shows global temperatures have increased significantly in the past two decades.","https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6224016727001,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=483100048889085,https://www.aap.com.au/craig-kelly-year-of-global-cooling-claim-a-load-of-hot-air/,https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency,https://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/APJAS-2016-UAH-Version-6-Global-Satellite-Temperature-Products-for-blog-post.pdf,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/time-series/global/lt/dec/ytd,https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview,https://people.csiro.au/C/P/Pep-Canadell,https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/Climate-Science-Centre,https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/about/,https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-el-ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93southern-oscillation-enso-nutshell,https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/6942683c7ed54e51b433bbc0c50fbdea,https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/james.renwick,https://www.ipcc.ch/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/11/more-errors-identified-in-contrarian-climate-scientists-temperature-estimates,https://www.amazon.com/Roy-W.-Spencer/e/B001JPAG4K%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientist-who-rejects-warming-is-named-to-epa-advisory-board/,https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/30/19/jcli-d-16-0768.1.xml,http://www.remss.com/,https://www.carbonbrief.org/major-correction-to-satellite-data-shows-140-faster-warming-since-1998,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/msu/time-series/global/lt/dec/ann,https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/49/which-measurement-is-more-accurate-taking-earths-surface-temperature-from-the-ground-or-from-space/#:~:text=Since%20satellites%20technically%20measure%20neither,more%20accurate%20than%20satellite%20measurements.,https://climate.anu.edu.au/about/people/academics/professor-mark-howden,https://www.ipcc.ch/people/mark-howden/,https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/temp-2020_comparison-plot.jpg,https://skepticalscience.com/going-down-the-up-escalator-part-1.html",Has there really been no warming of the planet in 22 years?,,,,,,

The video has also been shared in New Zealand among other countries. A video claims Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine causes people to experience “irreversible” side effects. The AnalysisThe post’s claim that 3,150 recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the US experienced “irreversible” side effects to the CDC is false, according to health experts and documents from the US public health agency.Rather, almost all of the reported side effects were transient, short-term events which only impeded everyday activities for a short period of time. These are expected as part of an immunisation program, experts said.CDC vaccination advice states that people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine “may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection”.“Side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days,” it says.As part of its vaccine safety monitoring efforts, the CDC is using a smartphone app called V-Safe, which records health impacts or side effects patients experience after immunisation.A CDC presentation on anaphylaxis following the receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines shows that 112,807 people registered with V-Safe had received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (page 6). The app recorded 3,150 “health impact events”, which equates to 2.8 per cent of cases.Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide, told AAP FactCheck that “health impact events” encompass any event where the vaccine recipient is unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or requires care from a doctor or health care professional.“Typically this will be short term vaccine-related symptoms like fever, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, nausea etc., which can last for up to a week after immunisation,” Prof Petrovsky said in an email.“This percentage of health impact events is entirely in keeping with the reported clinical trial data.”Prof Petrovsky said there were no criteria for the duration or severity of health impact events in order for them to be included in the count. A case could be included even if the symptoms lasted for only a day, just as it would be counted if a recipient “saw a doctor to get a prescription for paracetamol or missed a day of work”, he said.A spokeswoman for the CDC told Reuters the figure of 112,807 was not the total number of vaccine recipients in the US, as suggested in the Facebook video.The CDC presentation said 272,001 vaccine doses had been administered by December 19, with six cases of anaphylaxis – a severe allergic shock – reported after administration of the Pfizer treatment (page 4).According to the Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine briefing document, there were 103 serious adverse events recorded in recipients during the Phase 2/3 clinical trials. However, the company said only three of these cases were linked to the vaccine, which was given to more than 18,000 trial participants (page 43, table 6).Associate professor Hassan Vally, an epidemiologist from La Trobe University with expertise in infectious diseases, described the video and post’s claims as “completely false”.Dr Vally said the post had “conflated anaphylactic reactions, which are very rare, with self-limiting and transient milder adverse health events”.“All vaccines that work induce an inflammatory response in individuals with a small proportion of people expected to experience mild to moderate short-term side effects,” he told AAP FactCheck during a phone interview.“These can be as mild as having a sore arm in some people, but others may feel generally unwell for a day and some may feel unwell enough to see a doctor. These reactions are expected but are generally very mild.”Dr Vally said there are some people who have “a moderate reaction to the COVID vaccination, but this is not cause for alarm based on the evidence we currently have”.On the claims that the Pfizer vaccine had left thousands with “irreversible damage”, Prof Petrovsky said there was no suggestion from the CDC report that any of these health events were irreversible.“The vast majority, if not all, of these events are almost certainly reversible and short-term, as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) would investigate and report any significant/severe events that continued much longer than expected from the trial experience,” he said. A doctor in New York extracts the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from a vial.","https://archive.vn/GMTEo,https://archive.vn/YKikM,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1Xdg2grSGk0FBAF3yTqk3jiAk8omQYxQwAYGvGXuO9Xfc6zrEVl4w0buc,https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/nikolai.petrovsky,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-side-effects/fact-check-video-misinterprets-report-into-health-impact-events-after-vaccination-idUSKBN29Q2B6?fbclid=IwAR0VcEoXbytB24FhvRepylPY7_LSAj5NCchQ6z5dU8Coz0SNUmuIt3Fsa6w,https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/about-allergy/anaphylaxis,https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download,https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/hvally",Video falsely claims Pfizer vaccine causes widespread ‘irreversible’ effects,,,,,,

Germany’s year on year death toll has not risen. There are simply more people being cremated as they DO NOT want autopsies on these bodies to find the true cause of death. FACTS!”At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 80 times and had more than 15,000 views. A Facebook post claims Germany’s year-on-year death toll has not risen despite COVID-19. The AnalysisGermany has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with more than two million confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 53,000 deaths, according to figures published by the World Health Organization on January 26.The Facebook post displays an apparent screenshot linked to a 9 News Australia article. That January 13 story, by The Associated Press, details how caskets had been stacked three high in the memorial hall of the Meissen crematorium in Saxony, eastern Germany, following a surge of coronavirus deaths.The article said the crematorium would typically have 70 to 100 caskets on site at that time of year, when the winter flu season usually takes a toll on the elderly. But this year there were 300 bodies waiting to be cremated and dozens more being delivered each day, it said.While the post claims that “Germany’s year on year death toll has not risen”, provisional results from the country’s federal statistical office, Destatis, showed mortality figures in 2020 were higher than in any of the preceding four years.Data included in the Destatis update shows a total of 972,155 people were reported dead across the 52 weeks of 2020. That was 40,973 higher than the 2016-2019 average deaths for the same time period, an increase of four per cent.The overall rise came despite the number of deaths in the first 10 weeks of 2020, before the pandemic began causing mass fatalities in Germany, being significantly lower than the 2016-19 average.The 2020 death toll was four per cent higher than in 2019, two per cent higher than 2018, five per cent higher than 2017 and seven per cent higher than 2016. The 52-week tally for 2020 included 35,415 COVID-19-related deaths.Destatis said that since October the number of people who died and who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had been rising steadily from week to week.In week 52, 5040 COVID-19 deaths were reported to German government agency for disease control and prevention, the Robert Koch Institute. That was an increase of 352 compared with the preceding week.The provisional results showed at least 24,470 people died in Germany in Week 52 (December 21-27, 2020), 5832 higher than the 2016-2019 average – or an increase of around 31 per cent.Destatis noted: “Up-to-date information on the number of deaths can be provided with a delay of about four weeks. The results available for 2020 will increase slightly on account of late reporting.”The statistics agency has been conducting a special evaluation of provisional death figures in Germany to monitor whether COVID-19 will lead to excess mortality in the country.In an update on January 22, Destatis said: “By calendar week in 2020, there have continuously been significantly increased mortality figures compared with the average across 2016 to 2019 from Week 13 to Week 18 (23 March to 3 May).“The deviation was largest in Week 15 (6 to 12 April) with 15% more deaths compared with the four-year average. Also, the number of COVID-19 deaths reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) was then highest in that week.”Over the month of April, the number of deaths was 10 per cent above the average across the previous years. In August, during which there was a heat wave, the figure was seven per cent higher. In October, it was five per cent higher, and in November, 12 per cent higher.German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) published a fact check in November 2020 that explored the question, “Are more people dying than usual?”“Yes. As in many other countries, more people will die in Germany in 2020 than in previous years,” DW wrote, referencing data from Destatis.“The spread of the coronavirus has led to a clearly discernible excess mortality rate, or the number of all deaths exceeding the annual historical average at a given time.”AAP FactCheck has previously addressed similar false claims about excess deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19 in the United States. A German crematorium worker among coffins for people who died during the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://archive.is/EVOIV,https://www.facebook.com/9News/posts/4048041448576995,https://archive.vn/yHwep,https://www.9news.com.au/world/bodies-pile-up-at-crematorium-in-germanys-virus-hot-spot/4310d5ca-bc70-4df2-8b17-6dfe09349f02,https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2021/01/PE21_032_12621.html,https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html,https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Cross-Section/Corona/Society/population_death.html,https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Population/Deaths-Life-Expectancy/mortality.html,https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-how-deadly-is-the-coronavirus-in-germany/a-55733525,https://www.aap.com.au/the-us-isnt-headed-for-fewer-deaths-in-2020-with-covid-19/",Germany’s annual death toll rise is all too real,,,,,,

The hypocrisy astounds me…”At the time of writing, the post by a user from Australia had been shared more than 225 times and generated more than 70 comments and 490 reactions. A Facebook post claims 23 people in Norway died from the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19. The AnalysisNews reports on January 15 drew global attention to 23 deaths in Norway among elderly people who had received the COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.However, many social media reactions to the news linked the deaths to the Pfizer vaccine without providing key context, as detailed by Norwegian fact checkers, Faktisk.The Norwegian Medical Agency (NMA) reported that by January 14 there had been 23 suspected deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccines reported to the Norwegian ADR (adverse drug reactions) registry.An NMA background report said in many of the fatalities “no link with vaccination is suspected” and “the event was due to an underlying illness suffered by the patient”. It noted that only the elderly in nursing home or long-term care facilities had received vaccinations to date.“Every day, an average of 45 people die in Norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions,” the report added.“When vaccinating such a group, deaths will inevitably occur shortly after the vaccine is administered. The vast majority of those who have been vaccinated appear not to have suffered any adverse reaction to the vaccine.”But the report also said that for some of the frailest patients the possibility that relatively mild side effects from the vaccine may have caused serious health consequences could not be ruled out.NMA medical director Steinar Madsen told Bloomberg in an interview on January 18 that a connection between the vaccine and the deaths was difficult to prove.“Clearly, COVID-19 is far more dangerous to most patients than vaccination. We are not alarmed.”In an update to the story on January 19, Dr Madsen said: “We can’t say that people die from the vaccine. We can say that it may be coincidental. It is difficult to prove that it’s the vaccine which is the direct cause.”A senior physician at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Dr Sara Viksmoen Watle, said the fatal incidents among severely frail patients do not imply a causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and death.“In order to be able to interpret this information, it is important to see the full picture,” Dr Watle told the NIPH.“Nursing home residents are at very high risk of a severe disease course or dying from COVID-19, and have therefore been prioritised for vaccination. A large proportion of those who live in nursing homes have severe underlying conditions or are in the last stages of life.”Dr Watle said that 48,680 people had been vaccinated against COVID-19 in Norway as of January 18 and the majority had mild or no side effects.“So far, there are no statistical analyses that indicate that coronavirus vaccination has had an increased risk of death among those vaccinated.”A spokesman for Pfizer told AAP FactCheck in an email: “The Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA) has reported while a possible connection in the most vulnerable patients cannot be ruled out, they have confirmed there is no evidence of a direct link between the deaths and vaccination.“NIPH has clarified its vaccination guidance for severely frail patients (for example equivalent to Clinical Frailty Scale 8 or higher) and terminally ill patients including a careful assessment of the benefit versus risk of the vaccination. Our immediate thoughts are with the bereaved families.”AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims which linked deaths among Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trial participants to adverse effects.

22,,,,Somewhat True,,2021-01-25,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-australia-have-the-least-efficient-cars-in-the-developed-world/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Does Australia have the least efficient light vehicle fleet in the developed world?The Statement“We are driving the least efficient fleet of cars and light trucks in the developed world.”Mark Butler, Labor MP and opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, December 15, 2020.The AnalysisA Labor frontbencher has claimed Australia has the least efficient cars and light trucks in the developed world while calling out the government for inaction on cleaning up the nation’s fleet.Mark Butler, the opposition’s climate change and energy spokesman, made the comments in response to the government’s draft electric vehicles strategy, which was leaked to the ABC.“We are driving the least efficient fleet of cars and light trucks in the developed world and there’s nothing in this strategy to help clean up the fleet,” he said.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Butler’s claim that Australia has the least efficient light vehicle fleet in the developed world.When contacted about the statement, Mr Butler’s office said it was based on a 2016 government report, Improving the Efficiency of New Light Vehicles, and referred to a paragraph in the executive summary on vehicle emissions.The report said: “Australia’s light vehicle fleet is less efficient than many other countries.” (page 5)It said the average new light vehicle sold in Australia in 2015 emitted 184 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (g/km), while passenger vehicles emitted 175g/km and light commercial vehicles emitted 229g/km.This was around 46 per cent higher than the average passenger vehicle emissions and 36 per cent higher than light commercial vehicle emissions in the European Union (EU).Australia’s average new vehicle emissions were also marginally higher than those in the United States, based on 2014 figures, despite light vehicles in the US being “larger on average (with) fewer diesel options”, the report said.The analysis was based on figures from the European Environment Agency (EEA), published in 2016, and International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT), published in 2015.However, the report Mr Butler cited did not include figures for all developed countries and did not have figures on fuel efficiency.For the purpose of this article, AAP FactCheck looked at both efficiency and emissions data where possible.A 2019 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) compared average vehicle emissions in 50 countries. The findings have also been collated into an interactive graph.The report showed that Australia’s light vehicle emissions per kilometre and average fuel consumption were third-highest behind the US and Canada among United Nations-designated developed countries (page 87).Several developing countries, such as the Philippines, Russia and Peru, also had less-efficient vehicles than Australia, although others, including China, Mexico and South Africa, had more efficient cars and light trucks.The report noted that countries used different testing regimes, but the figures had been converted with equations developed by the ICCT for the purpose of comparison (Footnote 1, page 74).A report on vehicle emissions released by Australia’s National Transport Commission (NTC) in June 2020 also showed the country’s light vehicle emissions were among the highest in the developed world.A comparison between 12 countries and the EU showed average new car emissions in Australia were higher than in any other developed country. This was based on figures from the ICCT for 2017 or the most recent available years (page 26).For light commercial vehicles (page 27), Australia’s average emissions were again higher than those in Canada or the US, although they were below those in South Korea, which is classified as developing by the UN but ranks above many European countries on the Human Development Index.Passenger vehicles were defined as “passenger motor vehicles and SUVs”, while light commercial vehicles were defined as “light trucks” (page 7). The report notes that emissions intensity, used for the comparisons, was a measure of vehicle efficiency rather than actual emissions (page 6).A report by independent consultancy Transport Energy/Emission Research (TER), released in 2019, also compared new passenger vehicle average emissions based on official data from Australia, the EU, the US and Japan from 2005 to 2017.It found Australian vehicles had the highest emissions in all of the years (figure 1, page 4), noting that “the differences between Australia and the other jurisdictions have been increasing over time” in both emissions intensity and fuel consumption.TER founder Robin Smit told AAP FactCheck that every region in the world had its own emissions testing regime, and official figures often underestimated vehicles’ true, on-road emissions making it difficult to accurately compare countries.“I personally find it hard to believe Canada or US are higher (for vehicle emissions) than Australia in real-world conditions, considering our fleet characteristics, fuel quality and lack of maintenance programs.”Griffith University taxation lecturer Anna Mortimore, an expert on vehicle emissions policy, said Australia’s vehicle emissions would likely be higher than those in Canada or the US – at least in the future – as these countries had policies and targets to reduce emissions, whereas Australia did not.Dr Mortimore pointed to the website Climate Action Tracker, which compares climate change policies between countries and was partly funded by the German Ministry for the Environment. It said that Australia was “one of the few G20 countries without mandatory emissions or fuel efficiency standards for cars”.Canada has a target that 10 per cent of new vehicles will be electric by 2025, rising to 100 per cent by 2040. The US has a target of improving the average fuel efficiency of new light duty vehicles by 1.5 per cent for each year to 2026.“Without regulations, Australia’s vehicle emissions improvements have basically stalled,” Dr Mortimore said. “Last year, vehicle efficiency improved by just 0.2 per cent in 2019 (Table 10, page 29). This is an example of what happens without regulations or targets.” Australia has among the developed world’s least efficient vehicle fleets.","https://www.alp.org.au/our-people/our-people/mark-butler/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-15/federal-government-draft-paper-into-electric-vehicle-use-slammed/12983416,https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/vehicles/environment/forum/files/Vehicle_Fuel_Efficiency_RIS.pdf,https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/reported-co2-emissions-from-new,https://theicct.org/mission-history,https://webstore.iea.org/download/direct/2458?fileName=Fuel_Economy_in_Major_Car_Markets.pdf,https://www.iea.org/about,https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/market-snapshots/2019/market-snapshot-how-does-canada-rank-in-terms-vehicle-fuel-economy.html#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20Canada's%20average,kilometres%20(L%2F100km).&text=In%20comparison%2C%20fuel%20consumption%20averaged,4.9%20L%2F100km%20in%20Portugal.,https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2020_Annex.pdf,https://www.ntc.gov.au/sites/default/files/assets/files/Carbon-dioxide-emissions-intensity-for-new-Australian-light-vehicles-2019.pdf,http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI,https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d0bd25_9527cdcb01a84440a53308b3b5624320.pdf,https://www.transport-e-research.com/about-us,https://experts.griffith.edu.au/7514-anna-mortimore,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fy3t_NsAAAAJ&hl=en,https://climateactiontracker.org/about/,https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/,https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/organisations/g20/Pages/g20#:~:text=The%20members%20of%20the%20G20,States%2C%20and%20the%20European%20Union.,https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-transportation/zero-emission-vehicle-infrastructure-program/21876,https://www.nhtsa.gov/corporate-average-fuel-economy/safe#:~:text=The%20Safer%20Affordable%20Fuel%2DEfficient%20(SAFE)%20Vehicles%20Rule%2C,model%20years%202021%20through%202026.,https://www.nhtsa.gov/corporate-average-fuel-economy/safe-fact-sheet,https://www.ntc.gov.au/sites/default/files/assets/files/Carbon-dioxide-emissions-intensity-for-new-Australian-light-vehicles-2019.pdf",Does Australia have the least efficient cars in the developed world?,,,,,,

Many of these were in regional areas.The government’s PING program, worth $50 million, provided funding to support “the continued production of high quality news in regional and remote areas of Australia”.Many major news organisations were granted funding under the program, including Southern Cross Austereo ($10.2 million) and WIN Corporation ($4.4 million), while Australian Associated Press (AAP) received a grant worth $5 million, increasing the fund’s total pool to $55 million.Neither News Corp nor its regional subsidiaries appear in the list of grant recipients.News Corp Australia corporate affairs executive Campbell Reid told AAP FactCheck via email that the company did not lobby the government for regional news grants in 2020, and it had not received any related government funding for its local and regional news operations.A spokesperson for the Department of Communications confirmed that News Corp did not apply for any funding under the PING program, nor was it among the 107 regional publishers and broadcasters awarded grants.An earlier government scheme, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund (RSPIF) started in 2018 as part of the Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package.

Repeat after 3 days.”At the time of publication, the post has been shared more than 200 times and more than 15,000 views. A post lists ingredients such as toothpaste, onions and Vaseline as cure for varicose veins. The AnalysisThe post’s makeshift remedy for treating varicose veins has no scientific basis, medical experts told AAP FactCheck. Anyone wanting to treat the condition is advised to speak to a doctor.The claimed treatment has been shared by multiple Facebook pages, including in Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia.Varicose veins are enlarged and swollen veins most commonly found in people’s legs and feet. They occur when surface veins have trouble sending blood up to the heart from the feet and legs, leading to enlarged purple clusters visible under the skin.For many people, varicose veins are only a cosmetic issue, but for some they can cause pain or discomfort and occasionally lead to more serious health problems.University of Otago professor Andre van Rij, a vascular surgeon who heads the university’s Vascular Research Group, told AAP FactCheck via email the post’s mixture of ingredients are not recognised as a treatment.He said the ingredients may cause a skin irritation for some people, especially if applied frequently.Dr Giri Mahadevan, an Auckland-based vascular surgeon based who specialises in the treatment of varicose veins, told AAP FactCheck: “There are no creams/lotions that have been scientifically proven to work from proper trials that have been published in reputable journals.”When asked whether the purported remedy could be dangerous, Dr Mahadevan said via email: “I  can’t see how it would be harmful as it is only applied to the skin and not taken. It could be harmful if you apply to an ulcer from varicose veins.”Treatments recommended for varicose veins range from lifestyle changes and compression therapy to medication and surgery, according to the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.Prof van Rij said treatment depends on the “type, extent, and severity of the varicose veins and the effects on the skin”.“Best to consult a physician with expertise in care of venous disease.”Dr Mahadevan agreed, telling AAP FactCheck: “They should see their general practitioner/family doctor first. After assessment and discussion they may be referred (to) a specialist.”The same purported treatment for varicose veins has been debunked in Africa.The post’s ingredients, which include toothpaste, aren’t a treatment for varicose veins, experts say.","https://archive.is/ScSqo,https://archive.is/WqeGn,https://archive.is/nP92L,https://archive.is/h1oQA,https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/health-a-z/v/varicose-veins/,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/heart_vascular_institute/conditions_treatments/conditions/varicose_veins.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/varicose-veins/symptoms-causes/syc-20350643,https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm-surgery/staff/expertise/profile/index.html?id=686,https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm-surgery/research/vascular/index.html,http://www.vasculardr.com/surgeon/mahadevan.html,https://auckland-veins.co.nz/specialists.html,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/varicose-veins,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/no-mixture-toothpaste-and-onions-not-remedy-varicose-veins",Toothpaste and onions?

25,,,,False,,2021-01-20,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/university-of-queensland-covid-19-vaccine-claims-fail-truth-test/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA video shared on social media claims the Australian government allocated around $700 million for the University of Queensland’s potential coronavirus vaccine despite the university failing to meet a “peer review” benchmark for the funding.The video on the Facebook page of Riccardo Bosi, a former army lieutenant-colonel and political aspirant, features an excerpt from an episode of his YouTube talk show with Joel Jammal in which they both discuss Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine plan.Mr Bosi claims that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison “put 700-odd million dollars into a vaccine that scored three out of seven out of Queensland” (video mark 55sec).He goes on say that research candidates “need to score four out of seven out of peer reviews and have produced a vaccine before you get that level of funding”.Mr Bosi goes on to claim: “We know that the (PCR) test doesn’t test for COVID. The designer of the test – the CPR, CRP (sic) – we know the test is bogus and yet this imbecile and his mates in the States are rolling it out. The test is meaningless.” (video mark 1min 37 sec).At the time of writing, the January 11 post had been viewed more than 170,000 times and shared over 4000 times, attracting more than 5,600 reactions and 1,200 comments. A video claims the government gave UQ aound 0m for COVID-19 vaccine development. The AnalysisThe Australian government invested only a tiny fraction of the claimed $700 million in the University of Queensland’s unsuccessful COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which it says met all requirements for the allocated funding.Australia is due to roll out COVID-19 immunisations in mid-late February with priority given to health, border control and aged-care workers.Before announcing the plan, the government entered into four vaccine supply agreements, with Pfizer/BioNTech, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and Gavi’s COVAX Facility.It also granted $5 million in financial support for a vaccine candidate developed by UQ, however clinical trials did not proceed to phase three after several phase one trial participants returned false positive HIV test results.The Queensland government also allocated $10 million to the UQ vaccine program on top of the federal government funding.A federal Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email that UQ vaccine applications were awarded research grants of $5 million.“In 2019-20, $5 million was allocated through the Medical Research Future Fund for research supporting the development of the University of Queensland vaccine,” the department spokeswoman said.According to the government’s grants portal, the UQ vaccine program received a $3 million grant in April 2020 and a near-$2 million grant in June 2020.The UQ candidate was developed in partnership with Australian biotech company CSL, which would manufacture the product if it was successful. CSL announced the agreement in a press release – and confirmed the federal government’s $5 million funding.Regarding to the claim of “peer study” benchmarks for funding, a spokeswoman for the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the Australian body which funds medical research, told AAP FactCheck in an email that it a seven-point scale was used to assess grant opportunities, and applications are considered for funding in rank order based on those scores.“Whether the grant opportunity sets a minimum score that must be achieved depends on the objectives of the program. If a minimum score must be met, it is specified in the published grant guidelines for each grant opportunity,” she said.“UQ was awarded funding of $5 million for COVID-19 vaccine development through two Medical Research Future Fund grant opportunities, with one using the seven-point rating scale and the other using a three-point rating scale.”A UQ spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck in an email the university “had not been advised of any scoring or ranking information” as part of its vaccine grants.The Department of Health spokeswoman said the outcomes of evaluations made by grant assessment committees were confidential.“However, the University of Queensland’s applications for funding met the requirements of the Grant Opportunity Guidelines. Any applications that failed to meet these requirements of the (guidelines) would be ineligible for funding under that grant opportunity,” the spokeswoman said.Before UQ clinical trials were halted in December, the government had announced an investment of $1.7 billion to pre-order 84.8 million doses of UQ and AstraZeneca vaccines.A Department of Health spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck that details on the UQ deal was “commercial in confidence”, however media reports said the agreement was worth $1 billion for 51 million doses. The UQ purchase did not proceed as the planned vaccine trials were aborted.AAP FactCheck sent a number of questions to Mr Bosi regarding his claims but received no response.The suggestion the inventor of PCR tests said they were ineffective at detecting COVID-19 has previously been debunked, as has misinformation about false positives rendering testing results meaningless and tests not being able to distinguish between COVID-19 and the flu or common cold.Dr Ian MacKay, a virologist from the University of Queensland previously told AAP FactCheck PCR tests used to detect COVID-19 infections in people were “extremely effective at very sensitively and specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2”.“The leading tests have also been tested on SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected patients, isolated and grown in cells in the lab – so we know it is this virus that we’re detecting,” he said.AAP FactCheck previously debunked claims in another video on Mr Bosi’s Facebook page that the Prime Minister helped president-elect Joe Biden “violate the Logan Act”. PM Scott Morrison visited the University of Queensland’s Vaccine Lab on October 12, 2020.","https://archive.vn/kBf7x,https://www.lionheartaustralasia.com/about-riccardo-bosi,https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/SenateStateFirstPrefs-24310-NSW.htm,https://www.youtube.com/user/joeljammal/about,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-12,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/01/australia-s-covid-19-vaccine-national-roll-out-strategy.pdf,https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/about-covid-19-vaccines/australias-vaccine-agreements#covax-facility,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/australia-secures-20-million-extra-astra-zeneca-vaccines,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-covid-vaccine-terminated-due-to-hiv-false-positives-20201210-p56mju.html,https://advance.qld.gov.au/vaccine,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/66-million-for-coronavirus-related-research,https://www.grants.gov.au/Ga/Show/b0d175ad-dd8b-03ee-6fc3-6dad1e488c3f,https://www.grants.gov.au/Ga/Show/44e31147-bed7-e8e3-fd53-e67c48f2f824,https://www.csl.com/our-company/our-story,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-university-of-queensland-cepi-and-csl-partner-to-advance-development-and-manufacture-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-301071175.html,https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/who-we-are,https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/funding/medical-research-future-fund,https://www.finance.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-11/commonwealth-grants-rules-and-guidelines.pdf,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/australian-government-finalises-university-of-queensland-csl-covid-19-vaccine-agreement,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-covid-vaccine-terminated-due-to-hiv-false-positives-20201210-p56mju.html,https://www.aap.com.au/pcr-inventor-who-died-in-2019-did-not-say-his-test-wont-work-for-covid-19-infections/,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-false-positives-dont-make-case-figures-meaningless/,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-resurface-about-tests-for-covid-19-and-its-survival-rate/,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/4428,https://www.aap.com.au/pcr-inventor-who-died-in-2019-did-not-say-his-test-wont-work-for-covid-19-infections/,https://www.aap.com.au/did-scott-morrison-help-joe-biden-violate-the-logan-act-with-a-phone-call/",University of Queensland COVID-19 vaccine claims fail truth test,,,,,,
26,,,,Partly False,,2021-01-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/did-charlie-chaplin-say-the-worlds-best-doctors-include-sun-rest-and-exercise/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post lists four supposed statements by comedic British actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.The post, by an Australian Facebook user, begins: “Charlie Chaplin lived 88 years. He left us four statements:“(1). Nothing is forever in this world, not even our problems.“(2). I love walking in the rain because no one can see my tears.“(3). The most lost day in life is the day we don’t laugh.“(4). Six best doctors in the world…: 1. The sun; 2. Rest; 3. Exercise; 4. Diet; 5. Self-respect; 6. Friends. Stick to them at all stages of your life and enjoy a healthy life…”At the time of publication, the November 17, 2020 post had more than 150 shares and 18,000 views.Another Facebook post, which has been shared more than 60,000 times, features the same quotes and image – a colourised photo of Chaplin alongside American actor Jackie Coogan on the set of The Kid in 1921. A post purports to quote four statements by comedic British actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin. The AnalysisCharlie Chaplin made 81 films in a career spanning 53 years (1914-1967) from silent pictures to the colour era – but it’s far from black and white that every pithy phrase attributed to the legendary filmmaker is legitimate.The Chaplin meme dates back at least five years, with a post from April 2015 featuring three of the actor-director’s purported sayings before listing several other statements including the “six best doctors” quote. That post claimed to mark Chaplin’s 125th birthday, which was incorrect as he was born on April 16, 1889, not 1890.The post’s first quote is taken from Chaplin’s 1947 feature film Monsieur Verdoux: “Nothing is permanent in this wicked world, not even our troubles.” (57min 50sec mark)Chaplin expert Dan Kamin, who helped prepare Robert Downey Jr for his lead role in the 1992 movie Chaplin and authored the book The Comedy of Charlie Chaplin – Artistry in Motion, confirmed the quote.“By the way, the line is spoken by Chaplin as the title character, a serial killer who has picked up a prostitute on the street to test a poison on her. There’s sentiment for you,” Mr Kamin told AAP FactCheck.“This was Chaplin’s second-to-last film in America, and a resounding flop with the postwar audience.”The saying “I love walking in the rain because no one can see my tears” is credited here to Chaplin’s 1964 book My Autobiography. However, a search for the phrase and key words in the digital version returned no matching results.Kate Guyonvarch, managing director of The Chaplin Office in Paris, which represents the Chaplin family and manages his archives, told AAP FactCheck the quote was “absolutely, definitely not” in My Autobiography.Mr Kamin agreed, saying it sounded “much too simplistic” and “corny” for Chaplin.The third quote, “The most lost day in life is the day we don’t laugh”, is “attributed to Chaplin everywhere”, according to Ms Guyonvarch.“To be honest, we have even licensed the use of the Chaplin image in conjunction with it occasionally, as people are so adamant he said it – but we have never found a source for it,” she said via email.The phrase is much older than Chaplin and dates back to 1795, when the literary magazine Mercure de France reprinted a collection of maxims by French writer Nicolas Chamfort. One of them (on page 351) reads: “La plus perdue de toutes les journées est celle où l’on n’a pas ri.” (The most lost of all days is the day we haven’t laughed)Ms Guyonvarch told AAP FactCheck the post’s fourth saying about six doctors could not be attributed to Chaplin.“No, Chaplin did not say or write any of that,” she said.The six doctors saying has been previously attributed to both a fictional billionaire and Apple founder Steve Jobs, but those claims have been debunked.A 1996 book by English professor Wayne Fields, titled What the River Knows: An Angler in Midstream, includes a nursery rhyme closely matching the “six doctors” saying (page 66) without attributing it to Chaplin. The same nursery-song version, under titles such as “Doctors Six” or “the Six Good Doctors”, was published in journals as far back as in 1909 (see examples here, here and here), predating Chaplin’s career.Mr Kamin told AAP FactCheck the six doctors saying, like the “walking in the rain” statement, was too simplistic for Chaplin, “who had a particular love for throwing highbrow words like ‘neologism’ and ‘atavistic’ into his speech and writings”. Legendary silent film actor-director Charlie Chaplin in a scene from the 1925 film The Gold Rush.","https://archive.is/VSp3i,https://www.facebook.com/1718650065041649/posts/3718872688352700,https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/news-photo/american-actor-jackie-coogan-with-british-actor-director-news-photo/607410520,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jackie-Coogan,http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/filmog/,https://archive.is/d7uuu,https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/21-Overview-of-His-Life,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8lXHCXr_HA,http://dankamin.com/about-nr.html,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103939/,http://dankamin.com/books-by-dan-nr.html,https://quotepark.com/quotes/1072242-charlie-chaplin-i-always-like-walking-in-the-rain-so-no-one-can-s/,https://www.penguin.com.au/books/my-autobiography-9780141011479,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/My_Autobiography/ncaOcdTocAMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=charlie%20chaplin%20autobiography&pg=PT213&printsec=frontcover&bsq=rain,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1260694/,https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/130-The-Chaplin-Office,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Le-Mercure-de-France,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sebastien-Roch-Nicolas-Chamfort,https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=N3tBAAAAcAAJ&q=%22pas+ri%22&redir_esc=y&hl=en#v=snippet&q=%22pas%20ri%22&f=false,https://ausdoctorsfederation.org.au/2018/09/16/the-worlds-six-best-doctors/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/billionaire-steve-guoves-last-words/,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/What_the_River_Knows/GAkhLiBV0ZUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22best+six+doctors+anywhere%22&pg=PA66&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Bulletin/shFDAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&dq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/S_C_A_A_News/1eM5AQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&dq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/The_Neighbor/sQEdAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&dq=best+six+doctors+anywhere&printsec=frontcover","Did Charlie Chaplin say the ‘world’s best doctors’ include sun, rest and exercise?",,,,,,
27,,,,False,,2021-01-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-joe-biden-hasnt-been-tied-to-huge-corruption-in-ukraine/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA post by a New Zealand Facebook user makes several false or misleading claims about United States president-elect Joe Biden and corruption linked to Ukraine.The post says “Joe Biden never won the election” and goes on to state that “in Ukrainian corruption investigation Biden’s name came up 400 times”.“Obama Administration’s secret internal investigation found Joe Biden’s huge corruption link to Ukraine,” it continues. “Nancy Pelosi tried to hide the Biden family scandal by attempted impeaching (of) Donald Trump.”At the time of writing, the post had generated more than 800 comments and reactions and been viewed more than 30,000 times. A Facebook post falsely claims Joe Biden has been linked to corruption in Ukraine. The AnalysisThe post makes several false statements relating to Joe Biden, many of which confuse the US president-elect with his son Hunter and unproven allegations of impropriety relating to the younger Biden’s business dealings. The president-elect has not been credibly implicated in any corruption claims.On January 7, the US Congress certified Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election after pro-Trump rioters dramatically stormed the building.Mr Biden won the electoral college vote 306-232, while he also received over seven million more votes than the incumbent president, Donald Trump, in the popular tally. He is due to be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20.Following the election, Mr Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, however the president and his allies failed to substantively prove these allegations in more than 60 lawsuits lodged in various US courts.The post claims that in a “Ukrainian corruption investigation (Joe) Biden’s name came up 400 times”. It is unclear what this claim relates to, however it may be a reference to language used during Mr Trump’s 2019 impeachment.Mr Trump was accused of putting pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr Biden and his son in order to increase the US incumbent’s own chances of winning again at the 2020 election. The Senate acquitted him of the two charges, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Nevertheless, the “400 times” reference from the impeachment trial relates to Hunter Biden, not his father. Hunter Biden was hired to serve on the board of directors of the Ukrainian oil and natural gas company Burisma Holdings in 2014.Burisma and its founder Mykola Zlochevsky have repeatedly been accused of wrongdoing. State Department official George Kent told a House impeachment inquiry that Mr Zlochevsky had awarded gas exploration licenses to his own company while serving as Ukraine’s energy minister between 2010 and 2012 (page 89).In her presentation at the subsequent Senate impeachment trial on behalf of Mr Trump, former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi said that during the Democratic House managers’ presentations for the inquiry they referenced Hunter Biden or Burisma more than 400 times (page S596).“When (they) gave you their presentation, when they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma,” she said.“They spoke to you for over 21 hours, and they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times. And when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing – nothing – to see.”Senate Republicans later released a report from their investigation into potential conflicts of interest arising from Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine while his father was vice president and involved with Ukraine policy.That report criticised Hunter Biden’s “awkward” relationship with Burisma and money he received from various sources, including from China, saying: “Hunter Biden and his family were involved in a vast financial network that connected them to foreign nationals and foreign governments across the globe” (page 84).However, the report did not implicate Joe Biden in any wrongdoing. Senate Democrats released a competing document attacking the Republican report, claiming the earlier document amplified discredited allegations that were part of a known Russian interference campaign.There is no proof of a “secret internal investigation” by the Obama administration that found “Joe Biden’s huge corruption link to Ukraine”, as claimed in the post.The Republican Senate report noted that members of the Obama administration did express concerns about the propriety of Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma and how it could be “very awkward for all US officials pushing an anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine” (page 4).Again, these concerns related directly to Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma, not any corruption allegations linked to his father.Hunter Biden is currently under federal investigation over his business dealings in China, which he acknowledged in a statement released to the media on December 9. The president-elect has also not been implicated in that investigation.Various claims relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine have previously been debunked, including that he was “wanted” in the country and that he withheld aid funding in order to help his son. Joe Biden is due to be inaugurated as US president on January 20.","https://archive.is/ng2JR,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/after-a-day-of-violence-us-congress-finally-certifies-joe-biden-s-presidential-election-win,https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2020,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/11/bidens-victory-another-example-of-how-electoral-college-wins-are-bigger-than-popular-vote-ones/,https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/press_release/jccic-statement-on-59th-inaugural-ceremonies/,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-media-social-media-elections-71d5469ac0bbccbfe601528a2517b239,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/,https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres755/BILLS-116hres755enr.pdf,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/05/trump-impeachment-vote-110805,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunter-biden-ukraine/what-hunter-biden-did-on-the-board-of-ukrainian-energy-company-burisma-idUSKBN1WX1P7,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/04/ukraine-to-review-legal-cases-amid-trump-claims-over-bidens ,https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2019-11-13_transcript_of_kent_taylor_hearing.pdf,https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2020/01/27/CREC-2020-01-27.pdf,https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/majority-media/johnson-grassley-release-report-on-conflicts-of-interest-investigation,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/us/politics/biden-inquiry-republicans-johnson.html,https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/200923_FullReport_PetersHSGACWydenFinance.pdf,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/09/politics/hunter-biden-tax-investigtation/index.html ,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/25/fact-check-joe-biden-never-wanted-ukraine/6420087002/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/21/fact-check-joe-biden-leveraged-ukraine-aid-oust-corrupt-prosecutor/5991434002/","No, Joe Biden hasn’t been tied to ‘huge corruption’ in Ukraine",,,,,,

In 1999, the magazine changed the title from Man of the Year to “Person of the Year”.Many of TIME’s past picks have been deemed controversial by other media outlets. Former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin was named Man of the Year twice, in 1939 and 1942, former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was awarded the title in 1957 and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatullah Khomeini was recognised in 1979, among many others since 1927.In a 2019 article for TIME on Hitler’s legacy, editor-at-large Jeffrey Kluger discussed the magazine’s naming of Hitler as Man of the Year for 1938, writing: “That choice abided by the dictum of TIME founder Henry Luce, who decreed that the Man of the Year – now Person of the Year – was not an honour but instead should be a distinction applied to the newsmaker who most influenced world events for better or worse.”Even when the relevant magazine issue was published in January 1939, TIME’s selection of Hitler as the Man of the Year was far from laudatory.“Hitler became in 1938 the greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today,” TIME wrote.“What Adolf Hitler did … left civilised men and women aghast. Civil rights and liberties have disappeared.”Similar memes and posts objecting to the choice of Hitler as Man of the Year (examples here, here and here) have been circulating on social media since at least 2016.TIME founder Henry Luce said the Man of the Year – now Person of the Year – was not an honour.","https://archive.is/nqxO5,https://time.com,https://time.com/3626016/person-of-the-year-faq/,https://time.com/5047813/person-of-the-year-history/,https://time.com/5047813/person-of-the-year-history/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Lindbergh,https://time.com/3617976/person-of-the-year-poll-history/,https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/time-magazine-10-controversial-people-year-article-1.2040428,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/time-person-of-the-year-most-controversial-picks-2018-12?r=US&IR=T,http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019694_2019592,00.html,http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019694_2019593,00.html,http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019694_2019594,00.html,https://www.thoughtco.com/times-man-of-the-year-list-1779824,https://time.com/5573720/hitler-world-influence/,https://time.com/author/jeffrey-kluger/,https://time.com/vault/issue/1939-01-02/page/1/,https://time.com/vault/issue/1939-01-02/page/14/,https://www.facebook.com/BradleeDeanSOL/photos/a.292070200923771/821820804615372,https://www.facebook.com/krisanne.hall/photos/a.115319045185787/1224551217595892,https://www.facebook.com/keith.schindler.9/posts/10218409110440039",Hitler was once named TIME ‘Man of the Year’ – but that’s no honour,,,,,,
29,,,,Partly False,,2021-01-14,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/misleading-post-sows-doubt-on-safety-of-moderna-vaccine-trial/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post claims more than half of participants across various age ranges in Moderna’s first COVID-19 vaccine trial had adverse reactions – despite the recipients purportedly representing an “extraordinarily” healthy subset of the population.The Facebook post from December 31, 2020, shared by New Zealand users, claims in its image text that Moderna only accepted 85 participants after imposing strict conditions, including that they “cannot have ANY medical conditions, must have perfect BMI, perfect blood pressure, cannot be on any type of medication and MUST adhere to lifestyle conditions”.The text then divides the participants into age ranges before quoting a series of percentages of the groups who were supposed to have experienced adverse reactions, before adding: “And who knows what types of long-term issues this may cause these people, too.”“They took a tiny sample of EXTRAORDINARILY, PERFECTLY HEALTHY adults to represent the population ~ And 50-70% of this tiny, perfectly group STILL reported adverse reactions.”At the time of writing, the post has been viewed more than 17,000 times and has attracted more than 230 shares and 130 reactions. The post highlights adverse reactions during Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine trial without key context. The AnalysisWhile many of the participants in Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine phase one trial experienced adverse reactions, most were minor – and no serious side effects were linked to the treatment.Moderna’s later phase three trial, used to assess the safety of the vaccine before it was approved for emergency use, involved more than 30,000 participants.In that trial, fewer than 0.1 per cent of vaccine recipients experienced serious adverse events deemed related to the treatment, a similar rate to that recorded in the placebo group (page 34, table 20).The post also misrepresents the health status of the people who were selected for the phase one trial, which required participants to be in “good health” but could otherwise be overweight with some existing medical conditions.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020, making it the second COVID vaccine to be approved in the country after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Moderna began working on a potential COVID-19 cure in January 2020, co-operating with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the phase one vaccine trials which began in March 2020.According to Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council, phase one clinical trials are done to “test a new biomedical intervention for the first time in a small group of people (e.g. 20-80) to evaluate safety (e.g. to determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects)” before moving onto large trial groups in the later phases.As the source of its information, the Facebook post included links to the phase one clinical trial listing from February 25 and a purported “safety summary report” prepared by the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) Emmes and dated June 2.The report was published by the US-based anti-vaccine group Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). AAP FactCheck was unable to verify the authenticity of the report, however an ICAN spokeswoman said it was produced in response to a lawsuit against the National Institutes of Health (NIH).A NIH spokeswoman said: “Due to the length and complexity of the report posted on the ICAN website, NIAID is unable to verify its legitimacy.” Moderna did not respond to a request for comment, while Emmes referred inquiries to the NIH.However, preliminary reports on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine have been released for 85 trial participants across two groups, those aged from 18 to 55 and those aged 56 and older.Neither trial resulted in any serious adverse events linked to the vaccinations, according to the preliminary reports, although mild symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain and localised pain at the injection site were common.The post claims that participants in the phase one trial represented “extraordinarily, perfectly healthy adults” with “perfect” body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure readings.However, eligibility criteria for the trial showed applicants only needed to be in good health with a BMI of up to 35 in the younger group, or 30 in the older cohort. Both are classified as obese.The average BMI of participants in both groups was around 25, classed at the bottom end of the “overweight” range (see table 1 in the reports for 18 to 55 and 56 and older).To be eligible for the trial, candidates also needed to have systolic blood pressure of no more than 150 mm Hg. Anyone with a systolic reading above 130 is considered to be in the stages of hypertension.The American Heart Foundation says people with hypertension are likely to be prescribed lifestyle changes and possible blood-pressure medication.Those with “significant” medical or psychiatric conditions – such as heart disease or immunodeficiency – were barred from the trial, but participants could have other acute or chronic conditions as long as they were deemed unlikely to risk the person’s safety during the treatment period.Dr Phillip Reece, a senior fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck entry criteria for phase one trials were intended to be restrictive.“As the initial Phase I trial is the first trial in humans, only healthy subjects are recruited to avoid the risk of harm to those with other medical conditions. Volunteers can vary significantly in their medical status at screening, so it is not surprising if a large number do not meet the entry criteria,” Dr Reece said in an email.The Facebook post highlights the number of adverse reactions experienced by the “perfectly healthy group” in the trial to cast doubt on the safety of the vaccine.However, additional information in the unverified safety summary report, which lists every purported reaction experienced during the phase one trial, states the majority of reactions were mild and not caused by the vaccine itself.Among the 18-55 age bracket, for example, it stated 32 of the 45 participants (71 per cent) experienced 82 unsolicited adverse reactions. Of these, 50 were deemed unrelated to the vaccine, while 64 were classed as mild.Examples of adverse events included in that tally, according to the report cited in the post, but not necessarily linked to the treatment include everything from “mild sunburn” and “mild arthropod bite” to flatulence, decreased appetite, hypertension, increased energy and nasal congestion.Supplementary data included with the published preliminary report notes 90 unsolicited adverse events among the 18-55 group, none of which were serious. The majority were mild and unrelated to the vaccine.Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide, told AAP FactCheck in an email that minor adverse reactions are extremely common in vaccine trials.“In total, having more than half of the participants in the vaccine trial report mild and transient adverse events is completely normal and to be expected,” Prof Petrovsky said.“When a regulator looks at such data, they are not interested in the total number of adverse events which are mainly mild and transient but instead will focus on the incidence of serious adverse events, particularly those that could potentially be life threatening.”Associate Professor Paul Griffin, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck that a large number of adverse events – particularly if they were severe and related to the vaccine – would lead to the phase one trial being discontinued, and the vaccine wouldn’t have proceeded to the phase three stage.The FDA’s EUA review of the Moderna vaccine’s phase three trial said that adverse events were reported in a higher proportion of vaccine recipients than placebo recipients due to “reactogenicity” – or the expected inflammatory response soon after vaccination (page 33).The review said there was no difference in serious adverse events between the vaccine and placebo groups. Four people died during the trial period in both groups, however none of the deaths were deemed related to the treatments.“If the related events are similar to what is seen in the placebo group, then that means there’s not a significant issue with the actual vaccine itself,” Prof Griffin added. A safety report shows Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine caused no serious reactions in early trials.","https://archive.vn/4gbFL,https://www.fda.gov/media/144673/download,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-vaccine#:~:text=On%20December%2018%2C%202020%2C%20the,SARS%2DCoV%2D2,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19,https://www.australianclinicaltrials.gov.au/what-clinical-trial/phases-clinical-trials,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04283461,https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Moderna-Combined-Production.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2ZKQ0cwvUYA66qIc_X9cC9-6wQrP5PlaswFkdn5pxptBIqkuJfMiC2rlI%20%20https://secure.emmes.com/emmesweb/about-emmes,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/secure.emmes.com/emmesweb/projects/103,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/contrary-to-viral-facebook-claim-numerous-studies-show-vaccines-dont-cause-autism/,https://www.icandecide.org/,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483,https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2028436,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04283461#eligibility,https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html,https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings,https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/27905-phillip-reece,https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483/suppl_file/nejmoa2022483_appendix.pdf,https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/nikolai.petrovsky,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/5596,https://www.fda.gov/media/144673/download,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583123/",Misleading post sows doubt on safety of Moderna vaccine trial,,,,,,

It helps prevent 14 types of Cancer and has powerful healing benefits.At the time of publication, the December 16 post from a user in Australia had gathered more than 200 shares, 530 reactions and 18,000 views. The Instagram account credited in the meme had been liked more than 28,400 times. A meme extolling the benefits of black garlic claims that it helps to prevent 14 types of cancer. The AnalysisBlack garlic is garlic that has been fermented with heat – and while it may not give you bad breath like the raw product, the post’s claim that it can prevent cancer carries only a faint whiff of truth.Black garlic has been consumed for centuries in countries such as South Korea, Japan and Thailand. It is produced when a raw garlic bulb is heated at a moderate temperature (60-90C) in a high-humidity environment for an extended period, fermenting the product and turning its cloves black.According to a WebMD article, the “garlic’s texture and flavour change as well. It’s softer, chewier, and sweeter than regular raw garlic”.Regarding health benefits, a South Korean laboratory study in 2016 noted that aged black garlic had been shown to have “strong anti-oxidant activity” in numerous pieces of research.It found that a black garlic extract cut “reactive oxygen species“, or so-called free radicals that can cause cellular damage, to less than half the levels found when a raw garlic extract was used (figure 1). However, the study identified that raw garlic demonstrated higher anti-inflammatory properties (figure 2).Studies in mice and rats also demonstrated black garlic’s potential anti-allergic and anti-cholesterol effects.A 2014 laboratory study found aged black garlic extract (ABGE) may reduce colon cancer cell growth, while an earlier study using mice showed black garlic helped prevent the growth of gastric cancer cells. However, both concluded that further assessment in clinical trials was needed.Another 2014 laboratory study using cell samples reported that black garlic had potential therapeutic value in the treatment of leukemia.On the benefits of garlic more broadly, the American Institute for Cancer Research said that while laboratory research showed allium compounds in garlic offer anti-cancer activity, “support for garlic lowering cancer risk is lacking in human studies”.“Questions remain on how well humans absorb the allium compounds formed from garlic, and the amount people need to experience the benefits that lab studies suggest may occur,” it noted.Experts contacted by AAP FactCheck said there is no robust evidence to support the claim that black garlic helps prevent 14 cancers.Tom Gonda, adjunct research professor at UniSA Cancer Research Institute, said he was sceptical of such claims as those contained in the meme.“I’m generally sceptical about claims around one ‘super’ or ‘miracle’ food or another preventing or curing cancer,” Prof Gonda told AAP FactCheck in an email.“Usually they’re based on limited or unreliable data, and rarely have any plausible mechanism of action behind them. The best evidence for reducing cancer risk – not eliminating it – is around the things most people already know: healthy and balanced diet, exercise, avoiding obesity, and so on.”Kathryn Bradbury, a senior research fellow at the University of Auckland and expert in nutritional epidemiology, said evidence about garlic’s influence on tumour development was lacking in human studies.“There is some evidence from laboratory-based studies that garlic may influence tumour development, and studies in rodents have shown that some garlic extracts may inhibit cancer,” Dr Bradbury said via email.“However, the evidence from human studies is not convincing. Several studies have followed thousands of people over time to see if those who eat more garlic are less likely to develop cancer.“The results are mixed: there is no consistent evidence from these long-term studies that people who eat more garlic are less likely to get cancer.”A 2015 article by US academics published in Cancer Prevention Research noted that epidemiological studies showed “some protective associations” associated with alliums – which include onions and garlic – however problems in assessing people’s consumption made research difficult.“If garlic consumption does reduce the risk of cancer, the amount needed to lower risk remains unknown,” the article said.Dr Bradbury agreed that black garlic has a different composition to white garlic, however “most human studies have not examined them separately”.“The World Cancer Research Fund systematically reviews all the evidence on food and cancer and concludes that non-starchy vegetables (which include garlic but also green, leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli) probably decrease the risk of aerodigestive cancers and some other cancers.“The specific claim that black garlic can reduce 14 types of cancer is not currently backed up by robust evidence.”Memes containing similar claims to those in the post have been addressed here and here.A woman walks past a cart filled with bags of garlic at a wholesale market.","http://archive.today/5AsXC,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIkMzAMHhDg/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1021949816301727#bib2,https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-black-garlic#1,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/4/430/htm,https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/reactive-oxygen-species,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901385/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317477/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917757/,https://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/5/1/66,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988500/,https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/food-facts/garlic/,https://people.unisa.edu.au/Thomas.Gonda,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/k-bradbury,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366009/,https://www.vishvasnews.com/english/health/fact-check-misleading-post-suggests-black-garlic-cures-cancer-health-experts-say-there-is-insufficient-scientific-evidence/,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-evidence-black-garlic-can-prevent-cancer-experts-say",Black garlic cancer-prevention claim has only a whiff of truth,,,,,,
31,,,,False,,2021-01-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/inspirational-quote-on-starting-over-isnt-from-c-s-lewis/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA meme, shared to Facebook by a user in Australia, includes a purported motivational quote from the late British author and theologian C S Lewis.The meme text, which appears over a cartoon of a top hat-wearing figure and a rabbit staring into the distance, says: “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”At the time of writing, the December 24 post had attracted more than 12,000 shares and more than 1.1 million views. A November 25 post featuring the same meme has been shared more than 24,000 times. A purported C S Lewis quote about starting over is similar to one from a book by James Sherman. The AnalysisWhile C S Lewis is well-known for his books and theological writings, the quote shared on Facebook is one of many misleadingly attributed to the writer that have gone viral, according to experts.Lewis (1898-1963), was a British author and academic best known for the classic children’s books, The Chronicles of Narnia series.Regarding the Facebook post, Steven Elmore, president of the C.S. Lewis Foundation, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the quote “is not one I’ve ever encountered by Lewis”.William O’Flaherty is the author of a book The Misquotable C.S. Lewis, which explores the phenomenon of inaccurate Lewis quotes. Much of the research for his book is featured on his website, including a look at the quote shared in the post.“(I did) search various word combinations from the version falsely attributed to Lewis to confirm the words are not in any of the published works by him,” he wrote.The website Quote Investigator also featured a post on the quote’s possible origins – and found no link to C S Lewis. Its analysis found the quote appeared to be based on similar wording in a 1982 book by author James Sherman called Rejection.“You can’t go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand new ending,” a quote from the book reads.Sherman published a series of motivational and self-help works in the 1980s and early 1990s with titles such as Stop Procrastinating: Get to Work, Farewell to Fear and How to Overcome a Bad Back.Jedidiah Evans, an associate lecturer in writing studies at the University of Sydney, agreed the quote was not by Lewis, adding that it didn’t match up with the author’s thinking as captured in other writings.“This doesn’t sound like Lewis to me,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email.Dr Evans compared the quote to a passage by Lewis in his 1952 book, Mere Christianity: “We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.”Dr Evans said the passage showed Lewis “in gentle opposition” to the quote in the meme, suggesting that “going back is perhaps precisely what we ought to be doing, if we’re on the wrong path”.Mr Elmore, from the C.S. Lewis Foundation, also cited the same book, telling AAP FactCheck: “My guess is that it is someone else’s paraphrase of Lewis’s quote from Mere Christianity.”As to why C S Lewis is frequently misattributed, O’Flaherty said it’s likely the famous author is credited because “people want a highly recognisable individual associated with something they enjoy or already agree with. It adds ‘weight’ to the expression”.He said another reason could be due to “an honest blunder”, adding: “Someone reads something referenced in a book and checks the footnote, but notices the name either before or after it without realising the error.”The purported quote has also been debunked here, while AAP FactCheck has previously investigated other quotes misattributed to Lewis.A purported C S Lewis quote about starting over is similar to one in a book by James Sherman.","https://archive.is/H6Vb7,https://archive.vn/LicXG,https://www.cslewis.com/us/books/,https://www.cslewis.com/lewiss-practical-theology/,http://www.cslewis.org/aboutus/faq/quotes-misattributed/,https://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis/,https://www.narnia.com/us/,http://www.cslewis.org/aboutus/staff/,http://www.cslewis.org/aboutus/,https://theologymix.com/author/williamoflaherty/,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1532638426/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=williamoflcom-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1532638426&linkId=de775d94b50de683c3cfde24a6cca5a6,https://essentialcslewis.com/2015/08/18/confirming-c-s-lewis-quotations-introduction/,https://essentialcslewis.com/,http://essentialcslewis.com/2017/11/11/ccslq-41-go-back-and-change/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/11/05/new-ending/,https://books.google.co.nz/books?redir_esc=y&id=IxlojurCuGYC&dq=James+Sherman+rejection&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=brand+new+ending,https://www.google.co.nz/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22James+R.+Sherman%22,https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/jedidiah-evans.html,https://www.google.com.au/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=We+all+want+progress.+But+progress+means+getting+nearer+to+the+place+where+you+want+to+be,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/26/fact-check-cs-lewis-cant-go-back-change-beginning-start-ending/,https://www.aap.com.au/never-too-old-motivational-quote-not-c-s-lewis/",Inspirational quote on starting over isn’t from C S Lewis,,,,,,
32,,,,False,,2021-01-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-the-abc-didnt-predict-new-york-would-be-underwater-by-2015/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post suggests Australia’s public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, predicted that New York City would be underwater due to climate change by 2015.The December 30 post, to the “Get Our ABC Back” Facebook page, features a meme containing an image of clusters of high-rise buildings surrounded and partially engulfed by water.Below the image is text reading: “FLASHBACK: ABC’s ’08 Prediction: NYC Under Water from Climate Change by June 2015.”The post’s caption includes the hashtags “auspol” and “defundtheabc”. At the time of writing, it had been shared at least 250 times and attracted more than 130 reactions.The same post or meme was subsequently shared to several Facebook groups and pages questioning the existence of man-made climate change (see here, here and here). A meme claims the ABC predicted that New York would be underwater due to climate change by 2015. The AnalysisWhile Australia’s national broadcaster has for years been reporting dire forecasts about the impact of climate change, it didn’t incorrectly place the Big Apple beneath the sea by 2015.The Facebook post and meme suggest the public broadcaster issued the prediction in 2008 without stating where the claim was made.The post’s hashtags refer to Australian politics and calls for government funding to be stripped from the broadcaster, while the “about” section on the Get Our ABC Back page states: “Australia would like our ABC to be non political and unbiased in its media content. The ABC is funded by the people and should be for all the people, not a percentage of the people.”However, the purported prediction in the meme appears to relate to the US ABC, the American Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company.The text in the meme matches the headline to a June 12, 2015 article on the NewsBusters website from the US-based Media Research Center, a self-described “media watchdog” that has been linked to the conservative movement.The NewsBusters article contains an embedded video containing footage it said ran as a 2008 US ABC promotion for Earth 2100, a two-hour special presentation that aired on June 2, 2009.Earth 2100 explored a worst-case scenario for humanity up until the year 2100 due to the effects of climate change. It follows the journey of Lucy, a fictional character who chronicles the effects of climate change during her life, starting in the year 2015.While the ABC video featured in the NewsBusters article links a number of extreme statements to the year 2015 – such as a carton of milk costing $12.99 – it does not clearly predict New York City could be underwater at that point.Rather, the video includes a brief animated graphic of Manhattan and surrounding areas being partially inundated with water without attaching any specific claims to the vision (video mark 20sec).In Earth 2100, a version of which appears here, a scenario in which NYC is catastrophically flooded occurs in 2075 not in 2015 (video mark 56min 42sec).The Facebook meme includes a different image to that featured in the ABC promotion to suggest a flooded New York. The image in the meme has been used online since at least 2007 (see examples here and here), with one blog post from the time crediting it to Vanity Fair.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation declined to comment on the meme when contacted by AAP FactCheck, however there is no indication the broadcaster has ever made a prediction that New York could be underwater by 2015.In a 2015 article it did, however, cite a Climate Central study’s prediction that parts of New York and other major cities may eventually be underwater due to global warming.The article said these rises “could unfold in 200 years, but would more likely happen over many centuries, perhaps as long as 2,000 years”. New York City could one day be threatened by sea level rises due to climate change.","https://archive.vn/HCA5q,https://archive.vn/VNeTq,https://archive.vn/IYzGK,https://archive.vn/6wz4I,https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/what-price-global-warming/8953450,https://archive.is/W7J5R,https://www.smh.com.au/national/defundtheabc-what-utter-trumpian-madness-20200626-p556pv.html,https://abc.com/,https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/#our-businesses,https://newsbusters.org/blogs/scott-whitlock/2015/06/12/flashback-abcs-08-prediction-nyc-under-water-climate-change-june,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/26/the-deep-roots-trumps-war-on-the-press-218105,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Earth2100/story?id=7697237&page=1,https://www.mrctv.org/videos/flashback-abcs-08-prediction-nyc-under-water-climate-change-june-2015,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDqRpM72Odg,https://thefirstmorning.com/2007/06/08/40/,http://blog.livedoor.jp/koumei555/archives/51900883.html,https://thefirstmorning.com/2007/06/08/40/,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22new+york%22+under+water+climate+change+2015+site:https://www.abc.net.au&rlz=1C1GCEV_enAU918AU918&ei=rsj3X_aLBo7asQXt0b3YCg&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwj2moqPqovuAhUObawKHe1oD6s4ChDy0wN6BAgEEDQ&biw=1280&bih=578,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-09/global-warming-to-impact-megacities-with-surging-sea-levels/6924328?nw=0,https://www.climatecentral.org/","No, the ABC didn’t predict New York would be underwater by 2015",,,,,,

Other versions of the claim have been shared widely, including in New Zealand. A Facebook post includes an image of a fake CNN article carrying COVID-19 vaccine injection advice. The AnalysisWhile the post claims to show a CNN article citing official research, the image is fake, the study does not exist and doctors have not advised that COVID-19 vaccines be administered via people’s genitalia.Many countries have begun administering COVID-19 vaccinations, including the United States and members of the European Union. In Australia, vaccinations are due to be rolled out in late February with priority given to health, border control and aged-care workers.However, there is no evidence of CNN publishing an article matching that seen in the post, and several stylistic features in the Facebook image also differ from other news articles on CNN’s website.For example, genuine CNN articles feature a different headline font, as well as an author’s byline and a date-line immediately below the header. These aspects are missing from the post.The post’s purported CNN article also features the name of the disease formatted as “covid-19” while CNN commonly uses “Covid-19”. Subheadings beneath photos and images in legitimate CNN articles are aligned to the left, not in the centre as shown in the post image. CNN declined to comment when contacted by AAP FactCheck.Both images appearing in the fake CNN article are also unrelated to the claim. The image of the doctor on the left is Dr Mohitkumar Ardeshana, a practitioner from Biote Medical’s Claremont Medical Center in California which specialises in hormone therapy.Dr Ardeshana previously told Indian fact-checking site Boom, “The article is completely fake. I have not said anything about such a study. It is a work of mischief by someone.”The image on the right purporting to demonstrate the procedure for administering the COVID-19 vaccine in the penile area features on the website for Kansas City’s Saint Luke’s healthcare service in instructions on how to perform a self-injection procedure to treat erectile dysfunction.The post claims the advice to administer COVID-19 vaccinations in the penis was based on “findings” from the University of California. A University of California spokesman told AAP FactCheck in an email the post is “untrue and widely debunked”.Vaccines have generally been recommended to be administered in muscles such as the anterolateral thigh and the deltoid muscle, based on the Department of Health’s Australian Immunisation Handbook.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the two COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use – from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – are recommended to be administered in the deltoid muscle in the arm.According to an article published in the US National Library of Medicine, administering a vaccine in a muscle “optimises the immunogenicity of the vaccine and minimises adverse reactions at the injection site”.“Injecting a vaccine into the layer of subcutaneous fat, where poor vascularity may result in slow mobilisation and processing of antigen, is a cause of vaccine failure,” the article said. The penis is not a muscle.An ABC News article says vaccines injected directly in a blood vessel are “vulnerable to destruction”, and therefore sites such as the upper arm muscle are recommended instead. Vaccines are commonly administered with an injection in the upper arm.","https://archive.vn/wHt8J,https://archive.vn/nIYrn,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html,https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/public-health/coronavirus-vaccines-strategy_en,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/01/australia-s-epidemiology-and-covid-19-vaccine-roadmap-australia-s-covid-19-vaccine-national-rollout-strategy.pdf,https://edition.cnn.com/search?size=10&q=%22Doctors%20encourage%20covid-19%20vaccine%20injections%20in%20penis.%22,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/07/health/covid-19-cases-counties-universities-cdc-study-wellness/index.html,https://www.biotemedical.com/bioidentical-hormone-replacement-therapy-provider/claremont-medical-center-claremont-ca-91711/,https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/fact-check-viral-news-doctors-covid-19-vaccine-injections-in-penis-cnn-news-11392,https://www.saintlukeskc.org/health-library/penile-self-injection-procedure,https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccination-procedures/administration-of-vaccines,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/downloads/standing-orders.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/downloads/standing-orders.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1118997/,https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/five-penis-facts/#:~:text=The%20penis%20is%20not%20a,a%20man%20is%20sexually%20excited,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-01-08/covid-19-vaccine-injection-upper-arm-muscle-deltoid-immune/13031918",Fake article’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘penis injection’ advice is a big flop,,,,,,
34,,,,Ambiguous,,2021-01-08,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/are-australias-forests-being-cleared-at-an-increasing-rate/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is the rate of land clearing in Australia increasing?The Statement“Here in Australia we’re clearing land faster than we used to, not slower.”Waleed Aly, academic and broadcaster, December 25, 2020.The AnalysisAustralia is clearing trees at an increasing rate and the country is on track to lose three million hectares of forest by the end of the decade, according to broadcaster and academic Waleed Aly.The Monash University politics lecturer and writer, who is also a presenter on Ten’s The Project, wrote a column for The Sydney Morning Herald which argued the destruction of forests around the world could increase the frequency of deadly viruses. This was because as habitats were destroyed humans were increasingly coming into contact with virus-carrying animals, he said.Dr Aly added that Australia had one of the world’s highest rates of deforestation – and the situation was getting worse.“Here in Australia we’re clearing land faster than we used to, not slower,” he wrote.“The World Wildlife Foundation lists 11 ‘deforestation fronts’, which will account for 80 per cent of the world’s deforestation between 2010 and 2030. Only one of them is in a developed country, and it’s a massive area spanning New South Wales and Queensland.“We’re on track to lose three million hectares of forest by 2030 in Australia.”AAP FactCheck examined Dr Aly’s statement that the rate of land clearing is increasing in Australia.When contacted, he said the statement was referring to “the acceleration in land clearing (especially in Queensland) that happened from around 2011 until around 2018”.He cited a 2018 article in the Guardian, titled ‘Global deforestation hotspot’: 3m hectares of Australian forest to be lost in 15 years. The article said this was based on analysis by WWF (formerly World Wide Fund for Nature) indicating land clearing in Queensland increased by a third between 2014-15 and 2015-16, with an overall increase recorded between 2010 and 2016.Dr Aly also cited a report on land clearing by the Climate Council which showed land clearing in Queensland declined when more restrictive laws were introduced in 2000, and then accelerated when regulations were weakened in 2013 (figure 1, page 4).Based on the annual Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) for Queensland, the report showed the clearing of native vegetation declined steadily from 2002-03 to 2009-10, however it then increased steadily every year to 2015-16, the most recent figures included (figure 1, page 4).Dr Aly also cited an article on land clearing in the ABC from December 17, 2020 which included figures for land clearing in each state based on the government’s National Greenhouse Accounts.It said logging had increased in some states and declined in others between 2010 and 2018, although it noted there had been a net rise in overall tree cover.AAP FactCheck also analysed official figures for land clearing and found conflicting information.Land clearing is monitored at a national level but with a focus on how land-use changes impact on greenhouse gas emissions, whereas state-based SLATS studies are designed to detect land clearing.The national monitoring shows clearing has declined in recent years, while the state-level monitoring shows clearing has increased.The latest federal government figures cover the period between 1990 and 2018 and show the amount of land cleared in both primary and regrowth forests has fluctuated from year to year but decreased overall (Table 1a).Across all states, land clearing declined between 1990 and 1995, from 922,300ha to 474,200ha, before steadily increasing again to a peak of 855,900ha in 2005. Clearing then declined to 377,700ha in 2011 and has remained at a fairly consistent level since, with 369,900ha cleared in 2018, according to the figures.If this rate continued, Australia would have cleared 3.69 million hectares of forest between 2020 and 2030.The latest National Greenhouse Gas Inventory report, released in May 2020, said “since 2008, the increase in forest cover from new and emerging forests more than offset losses from an increase in forest land clearing activity”.However, detailed figures show there were net decreases in forest cover in 2017 and 2018 after eight years of net gains (Table 1b).Based on these accounts, the majority of land clearing took place in Queensland and NSW – 69 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.University of New South Wales public sector management lecturer Megan Evans, who has written multiple papers on deforestation and land clearing in Australia, said the SLATS figures captured more clearing activity than the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory reports.“The national inventory is designed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions on a quarterly to annual basis, whereas the state systems have been developed to detect clearing events almost in real time, as a compliance and enforcement system,” Dr Evans told AAP FactCheck.She said the two systems also used different definitions when measuring changes in forest and vegetation cover and the SLATS system was more comprehensive.Dr Evans said NSW data showed land clearing had increased since the Biodiversity Conservation Act, a 2016 law liberalising land clearing regulations, was introduced.In Queensland, laws were passed in 2018 that were expected to reduce land clearing, however current data was only available up until that year, she said.In NSW, SLATS figures showed a significant increase in land-clearing rates since 2010, with the figures nearly double the 2009-2015 average in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 (figure 1).An accompanying spreadsheet showed land clearing increased from 33,200ha in 2014 to 60,800 in 2018 (Tab 1).The report noted that the satellite imagery used to monitor land clearing changed in 2015, but it did not state whether this explained the higher level of land clearance recorded (page 14).In Queensland, land clearing declined consistently between 2002-03 and 2009-10 (figure 1), from 552,715ha to 83,188ha (see Remnant Status table here). However since then it has increased significantly again, reaching 392,486ha cleared in 2017-18.Other states do not appear to regularly report on land clearance or produce SLATS analyses.The government’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory report notes the discrepancy between the federal government figures and the SLATS figures (page xxvi), saying the reason for the difference in the data was being investigated.Anita Cosgrove is a former researcher for the University of Queensland’s Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science who has co-authored multiple papers on land clearing and now works as Queensland campaign manager for conservation organisation, the Wilderness Society.She told AAP FactCheck the greenhouse gas inventory was designed to calculate greenhouse gas emissions and was “not a reliable indicator of land clearing rates”.“In contrast, the SLATS data is specifically designed to estimate changes to all woody vegetation, i.e. both forest and bushland,” Dr Cosgrove said.“SLATS is currently our most reliable measure of deforestation and land clearing rates. Unfortunately, it does not provide national data.”She said the SLATS figures showed land clearing declined in Queensland after the Beattie Government introduced laws to regulate broadscale land clearing in 2004, and increased when restrictions on clearing were liberalised in 2013.Stronger regulations were introduced in the state in 2018, but she said data was not yet available to establish whether these had an impact. State surveys show land clearing has increased in NSW and Queensland since 2010.","https://creativerep.com.au/artists/waleed-aly/,https://www.smh.com.au/national/this-year-wasn-t-unprecedented-if-anything-it-set-the-precedent-20201224-p56pzt.html,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/global-deforestation-hotspot-3m-hectares-of-australian-forest-to-be-lost-in-15-years,https://www.wwf.org.au/,https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/qld-land-clearing-report/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-10-08/deforestation-land-clearing-australia-state-by-state/12535438,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-inventory-reports,https://ageis.climatechange.gov.au/Reports/Activity%20Table%201990-2018%20-%20LULUCF.xlsx,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-2018,https://ageis.climatechange.gov.au/Reports/Activity%20Table%201990-2018%20-%20LULUCF.xlsx,https://ageis.climatechange.gov.au/Reports/Activity%20Table%201990-2018%20-%20LULUCF.xlsx,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-megan-evans,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aaABYLIAAAAJ&hl=en,https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australias-climate-change-strategies/tracking-and-reporting-greenhouse-gas-emissions,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/overview-of-biodiversity-reform#:~:text=New%20legislation%20introduces%20a%20balanced,and%20biodiversity%20conservation%20in%20NSW.&text=The%20State%20Environmental%20Planning%20Policy,biodiversity%20values%20of%20urban%20vegetation.,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-11-17/nsw-biodiversity-laws-get-mixed-reaction/8033620,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/04/queensland-passes-land-clearing-laws-after-gruelling-three-day-debate,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Native-vegetation/summary-woody-vegetation-change-statewide-slats-2018.pdf?la=en&hash=681360442F8DBAA7C4EF74BD58D4FE0ADF2DEE0E,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Native-vegetation/results-woody-vegetation-change-statewide-slats-2018.xlsx?la=en&hash=5D1420FFED42CFCE7930A4A0EE18F724E705296C,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Native-vegetation/summary-woody-vegetation-change-statewide-slats-2018.pdf?la=en&hash=681360442F8DBAA7C4EF74BD58D4FE0ADF2DEE0E%27,https://www.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/91876/landcover-change-in-queensland-2016-17-and-2017-18.pdf,https://data.des.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/excel_doc/0026/83825/slats-data-summaries-1988-2018.xlsx,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-2018,https://sees.uq.edu.au/profile/2929/anita-cosgrove,https://www.wilderness.org.au/about,https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/researchpublications/researchbriefs/2004/200406.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/qld-parliament-passes-legislation-to-relax-land-clearing-laws/5027656",Are Australia’s forests being cleared at an increasing rate?,,,,,,
35,,,,Partly False,,2021-01-07,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/jet-fuel-hoax-fails-to-get-off-the-ground/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA meme alludes to a so-called “jet fuel hoax”, claiming that passenger planes run almost entirely on compressed air despite half the cost of airfares purportedly going towards the cost of fuel.The text in the meme reads: “Today, 50% of the price of a plane ticket is said to pay for the fuel required. However, the truth is, commercial airliners run on roughly 90% compressed air, not jet fuel. The technology of using compressed air to propel a turbine was discovered by Viktor Schauberger in the 1940’s. Don’t believe it? Google: Jet Fuel Hoax.”A user listed as living in Australia shared the meme in a December 9 Facebook post to a public group with more than 85,000 members. At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 190 times, attracting over 430 comments and reactions. The meme refers to a “jet fuel hoax”, claiming that commercial planes run mostly on compressed air. The AnalysisThe COVID-19 pandemic may have stalled the international aviation industry, but it hasn’t grounded inaccurate claims about jet fuel’s impact on the cost of plane fares.The post’s suggestion – that passengers are paying inflated prices for plane tickets when planes run mainly on compressed air – is not new. One YouTube video from March 2018 that has been viewed more than 360,000 times claims in its caption to “look at the deception being perpetrated by the aircraft manufacturers and airlines charging for fuel they don’t use”.The video suggests only small amounts of fuel are needed to get a jet engine up to speed, however “in cruise mode the engines use very little to no fuel whatsoever” (video mark 12min). “We are being charged huge amounts for fuel that doesn’t exist. It’s not needed to fly these amazing machines,” the narrator says.AAP FactCheck analysed the two main claims in the Facebook post: that airliners are powered mainly by compressed air, and that 50 per cent of the price of an airline ticket is said to pay for the fuel required to fly.The US Department of Transportation acknowledges fuel costs are among the largest and most variable airline expenses, and one that “directly impacts the price of an airline ticket”.Citing data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the department said fuel costs represented between 15 and 20 per cent of airlines’ total expenses in a September 2019 update.The data showed in the first quarter of 2019, $5.2 billion, or 16.5 per cent, of US airlines’ $31.5 billion in domestic operating expenses was spent on fuel. In comparison, labour costs accounted for $10.5 billion, or one-third, of the total.The figures are consistent with earlier industry analyses, such as a 2013 breakdown by trade association Airlines for America which said 21 per cent of a domestic round-trip ticket price went on fuel costs.Even the pandemic-induced hit to airlines’ bottom lines appears to have left the equation broadly unchanged. For example, in its annual financial results, covering the year to June 2020, Air New Zealand reported that fuel accounted for one-quarter of its operating expenditure (page 2).Jet engines function by sucking in air, which is then compressed and combined with fuel before the mixture is ignited, as explained by NASA. The burning gas expands and is pushed out of the engine, producing thrust and propelling the aircraft.Dries Verstaete, an associate professor in aerospace design and propulsion at the University of Sydney’s School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, told AAP FactCheck the claim in the post was misleading rather than outright false.While it is true that the majority of the ignited mixture in jet engines is made up of compressed air, without fuel there would be no thrust – regardless of the proportion of air involved.“The atmospheric air is compressed inside the jet engine, fuel is burned to add energy to it, and then it is expanded downstream of the combustion chamber,” Dr Verstraete said in an email.“Part of the energy derived from that expansion is used to compress the air, the remainder is used to generate a high-velocity jet. Without fuel, the compression and subsequent expansion of the air would not be able to generate this high velocity jet, and thus there would be no thrust.“In the combustion, the energy of the fuel is ‘added’ to the air which allows it to generate more energy during the expansion than was needed to compress it. The excess energy is converted into thrust.”Similarly, a car’s internal combustion engine uses a compressed air-fuel mix in order to provide power to the wheels.“The mechanics are very different but the comparison does hold,” Dr Verstraete said. “The majority of the mass in a car engine is air. It just produces power instead of thrust.”Dr Verstraete noted that the fuel costs involved in operating commercial aircraft depended heavily on the type of flight.A 2018 Chinese study found fuel’s contribution to airlines’ direct operating costs ranged from 4 per cent for smaller short-haul flights when fuel was cheap to 45 per cent for the largest planes on ultra long-haul routes when fuel was expensive (appendix A).“The so-called direct operating costs, costs that can be directly associated with a specific flight, are typically around 50 per cent of the total cost. That is probably where that number (in the meme) is coming from,” Dr Verstraete said.“These direct operating costs include fuel, but also maintenance, crew, insurance, depreciation, interests and landing fees.”Dr Verstraete said planes burned a proportionally high amount of fuel on takeoff, however the bulk was consumed while aircraft were cruising as this period generally made up the vast majority of flight time.“A flight from Sydney to Canberra, for instance, will have a different breakdown in fuel use than a flight from Perth to London. Typically, the takeoff fuel will be less than 1 per cent of the total fuel burned of the flight, although this percentage can be a bit higher for the shorter flights,” he said. Fuel is among airlines’ biggest expenses – but it doesn’t make up 50 per cent of ticket prices.","https://archive.vn/XlOE7,https://youtu.be/YXRmcumPL3k,https://www.transportation.gov/administrations/assistant-secretary-research-and-technology/what-cost-airline-fuel-means-you,https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/first-quarter-2019-us-airline-financial-data,https://www.slideshare.net/a4amediarelations/ticket-breakdown,http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/covid-19-and-the-aviation-industry-impact-and-policy-responses-26d521c1/,https://p-airnz.com/cms/assets/PDFs/air-nz-2020-financial-results.pdf,https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/engines.html,https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dries-verstraete.html,https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/internal-combustion-engine-basics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1000936119301244#s0110",Jet fuel ‘hoax’ fails to get off the ground,,,,,,

The video then shows her touching her forehead and appearing to faint before two men rush to her aid.The post’s caption reads, “CCU Nurse at CHI Memorial in Tennessee loses consciousness on air during interview after recieving (sic) covid vaccination but doctors say it was not because what was in the vaccine. 💉🙄 #notomandatoryvaccinations #plandemic”.Another post, shared on December 21 by a user in Australia to the Facebook group “Justice for Tiffany Points Dover RIP”, reads: “Sad as it is.. a reasonable person would have to conclude that Tiffany is dead.“Her FB account is now deleted. A person who is a career caregiver does not play games with people who only desire her best. The ‘evidence’ to the contrary that I have seen posted here is weak hearsay at best.“Shutting up family members with death threats is precisely the sort of skullduggery that the deep state / big pharma participate in. Sooner or later I expect that the truth will come out.”Variations of the same claims have been shared widely across social media, with multiple groups set up in relation to the nurse’s purported death or disappearance (see additional example here). Facebook posts are speculating on the health of a nurse who collapsed after a COVID-19 vaccine shot. The AnalysisWhile nurse Tiffany Dover fainted after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, there is no evidence this was caused by the contents of the injection – and she has been filmed alive and well since the incident was captured on camera.The US Food and Drug Administration authorised the emergency use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 11, while a week later it issued a similar authorisation for the Moderna vaccine.Since then, many high-profile US figures, including Vice President Mike Pence, president-elect Joe Biden and the top US infectious diseases advisor, Dr Anthony Fauci, have been shown on television receiving vaccine doses.Under the US vaccine distribution schedule, healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents were allocated initial supplies of the treatments.On December 18, local media broadcast vision of six healthcare workers at CHI Memorial in Chattanooga, Tennessee, receiving their vaccinations, including nurse Tiffany Dover (video mark 9min 30sec).Around 17 minutes later, Ms Dover is seen responding to questions from journalists, however she begins touching her forehead during the interview before losing her balance and being helped to ground (video mark 26min 50sec).In separate news footage, she addresses the incident, saying: “I have a history of having an overactive vagal response, and so with that, if I have pain from anything – hangnail, or if I stub a toe, I can just pass out.“I feel fine now and the pain in my arm is really minimal actually, but it doesn’t take much … and I have passed out probably six times in the past six weeks, it’s common for me.”Dr Jesse L. Tucker, a physician at CHI Memorial, is also filmed talking about the incident, adding: “I think that she got a shot in the arm and it made her feel a little lightheaded, and she’s recovered now. It’s happened before apparently.“It is a reaction that can happen very frequently with any vaccine, with a shot of any kind. There’s no reason to suspect that that’s due to the vaccine whatsoever.”CHI Memorial released a statement after the incident saying the nurse “became dizzy and was assisted to the floor”, adding: “She never lost consciousness and quickly recovered.”According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are many medical procedures that can cause people to faint – including the administration of many types of vaccines.“Although fainting has a variety of possible causes, it is usually triggered by pain or anxiety,” the CDC says.Some social media users, however, picked up on the video to wrongly suggest that Ms Dover had died following the injection.Many of the claims centred on videos that showed listings from sources such as genealogy website Ancestry.com and US public records database SearchQuarry as purported evidence of the nurse’s death.However, these websites do not provide proof that Ms Dover has died. In a video showing a SearchQuarry query, for example, the narrator uses as evidence of her death a listing on the website for a Tiffany Pontes Dover in Alabama that cites “DeKalb County Death Records database” as a potential information source.But the video does not show any official reports or records of Ms Dover’s claimed death. AAP FactCheck performed the same search as seen in the video for entrepreneur Elon Musk, to pick a high-profile living figure as an example, and SearchQuarry similarly returned multiple potential results from various “death records databases”.Another video shows an Ancestry.com entry for a Tiffany Pontes in Alabama that lists her death as occurring in 2020.An Ancestry.com spokesman told AAP FactCheck via email that any user can create a new family tree and add individuals’ birth and death dates, among other details. “Ancestry does not verify this information,” he said.CHI Memorial Hospital has repeatedly confirmed that the nurse is fine and well, including in a December 22 video.The video caption reads, “We’re pleased to share Tiffany Dover is doing well. Here’s a video of her today surrounded by her colleagues who all support her.”Similar false claims about Ms Dover’s purported death have been debunked here, here and here. US healthcare workers have been given early access to COVID-19 vaccine doses.","https://archive.vn/mGeNt,https://archive.vn/aCshf,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3595954680485683,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHHDCluQxwY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHCQ3cM02DQ,https://youtu.be/VnarCLgWPgY?t=1775,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations.html,https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1024667824713083,https://youtu.be/tOH7XLHl2mo,https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/v/vasovagal-syncope.html,https://archive.vn/Aogue,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/fainting.html,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/23/fact-check-nurse-who-fainted-after-being-vaccinated-alive/4024424001/,https://www.bitchute.com/video/as1rvnNFNaQQ/,https://www.searchquarry.com/namesearch/results?trackstat=homepage-&fname=elon&lname=musk&recordtype=Death&state=all,https://www.bitchute.com/video/l9RLeX8oCM69/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxGR3y0gE_0,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9831617815,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/23/fact-check-nurse-who-fainted-after-being-vaccinated-alive/4024424001/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/not-real-news-a-look-at-what-didnt-happen-this-week/2020/12/24/b8b0eac8-4619-11eb-ac2a-3ac0f2b8ceeb_story.html",Nurse who fainted after COVID-19 vaccine shot is not dead,,,,,,
37,,,,False,,2020-12-30,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/craig-kelly-year-of-global-cooling-claim-a-load-of-hot-air/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementWhile scientists predict 2020 will be one of the hottest years on record, Australian politician Craig Kelly has posted data he claims show temperatures have in fact been falling during what he dubbed “the year of global cooling”.In a Facebook post on December 21, the federal Liberal Party MP cited figures he said demonstrated average global temperatures have dropped over the past 12 months.“On the 20th December 2019, the global temperature anomaly was +0.7°C (that’s 0.7°C above the 1979-2000 base),” Mr Kelly said. “However, on the 20th December 2020, the average global temperature anomaly has fallen to just 0.2°C (above the 1979-2000 base).“That’s a FALL in average global temperatures of 0.5°C over the past 12 months (from 20 Dec 2019 to 20 Dec 2020). And this has happened during the same period that C02 levels have increased from 411.75 ppm to 414.76ppm – and increase of 3.01ppm [sic].“Meanwhile UN Globalists demand we sign up their ‘Great Reset’ with ‘Net Zero by 2050’, thereby surrendering our competitive economic advantages to the Chinese Communist Party – because they claim this will reduce average global temperatures by 0.5°C by 2050 [sic]. Wake up, we are being conned.”The post, which went out to the more than 84,000 followers of Mr Kelly’s verified Facebook page, includes images of two climate maps from the global temperature tracking website ClimateReanalyzer.org showing temperature changes on the two cited dates.At the time of publication, the post had been shared more than 860 times, attracting more than 1,900 reactions and 950 comments. The Facebook post compares temperature anomalies from two days a year apart. The AnalysisAlthough the figures cited by Craig Kelly are broadly accurate, they don’t demonstrate that average global temperatures have fallen between 2019 and 2020 – nor do they reveal that higher greenhouse gas emissions aren’t warming the Earth.The Climate Reanalyzer website provides daily figures on global temperature changes by collating publicly available official data. It is run by Sean Birkel, a research assistant professor at the University of Maine Climate Change Institute.The daily updates include a figure showing the extent to which the global temperature that day deviates from average temperature between 1979 and 2000 (see 2m Temp Anomaly section).The website provides slightly different figures to those Mr Kelly cited, but they do show the temperature anomaly on December 20, 2020 was lower than the temperature anomaly on the same date a year earlier.On December 20, 2019, the temperature anomaly was 0.7°C above the baseline temperature, while on December 20, 2020 it was 0.3°C above the baseline temperature (not 0.2°C, as Mr Kelly’s post states).Importantly, these figures only show global temperature variations on two individual days. An analysis of monthly and annual figures shows fluctuations, but also a marked increase in global temperature from 1948 (the earliest date available) to October 2020 (the most recent figure).Australian National University Climate Change Institute director Mark Howden said Mr Kelly’s post was a classic example of cherry-picking data and there was “no merit” to the claims he made.Prof Howden said 2020 is set to be one of the warmest years recorded, and so far every month in the year had been warmer than the equivalent period in 2019.He pointed to figures from the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which showed 2020 had a more than 50 per cent chance of being the warmest year on record, ahead of the current record-holder, 2016.NOAA figures also showed the year to date was hotter than 2019, and every month in 2020 had been warmer than the same period a year earlier.“Last year was a warm year but not as warm as this year … so it makes no sense to say that the globe has cooled,” Prof Howden told AAP FactCheck via email.He noted that the temperature anomaly – the difference against long-term global averages – for each month of 2020 had lessened since March as the world transitioned from an El Niño to a La Niña weather pattern.However, he added that changes in climate were calculated by looking at trends over decades, not by comparing two dates 12 months apart.“Climate is essentially constructed from long-term averages. A rule of thumb is about 30 years of records (are) needed in a place to get a handle on what the average climate conditions are, due to year-to-year variability.”He said evidence of the connection between global temperature and CO2 levels was incredibly robust.“To think that cherry-picking a few dates can overturn the consistent, peer-reviewed, 170 years of accumulated science and data is verging on the dangerous.”Dr Birkel, who runs the Climate Reanalyzer website, said “comparing two days separated by a year is not sufficient to deduce a climate trend”.“Weather patterns can bring significant changes in the distribution of heat across the globe day-to-day and week-to-week,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.“While a daily temperature anomaly value for a given region on a given day does carry some baseline climate information, it is nonetheless strongly influenced by weather. In order to deduce climate trends, it is necessary to examine changes over decadal and longer timescales.”In addition to the website’s annual temperature anomaly tracker, which shows a clear trend of increasing global temperatures since 1948, it also includes a section dedicated to climate change showing temperature increases over the past century and projected increases for the future.Dr Birkel said he would update his website to advise people against drawing conclusions based on a comparison of daily figures alone.Earlier this month, the UN said 2020 is on track to be one of the three hottest years on record at about 1.2°C above the pre-industrial average. This was despite the presence of the La Niña weather pattern, which usually resulted in cooler temperatures.Figures from NASA chart global temperatures from 1884 to 2019 and show 19 of the 20 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the exception of 1998. Despite annual fluctuations, its figures show a steady rise in global temperatures since the early 20th century.NOAA analysis also demonstrates a strong correlation between atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature over the past 800,000 years. The organisation states: “When the carbon dioxide concentration goes up, temperature goes up. When the carbon dioxide concentration goes down, temperature goes down.”The agency said the last time CO2 levels were as high as today the temperature was 2° to 3°C higher than pre-industrial levels and sea levels were 15 to 25 metres higher. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 over the past 60 years was also about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, which it said was mostly due to humans burning fossil fuels for energy.In Australia, figures from the Bureau of Meteorology spanning from 1910 to 2019 also show temperatures have increased significantly, both in Australia and globally. It said last year was Australia’s warmest year on record, while spring in 2020 was the country;s warmest on record.The Bureau’s State of the Climate 2020 report found Australia’s climate has warmed by 1.44°C on average since records began in 1910. In an accompanying press release, CSIRO Climate Science Centre director Jaci Brown said the increasing temperatures were due to human-induced climate change.“Our science clearly shows that due to increasing greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere, Australia’s climate is continuing to warm, and the frequency of extreme events such as bushfires, droughts, and marine heatwaves is growing,” Dr Brown said. Liberal MP Craig Kelly says people are being “conned” about climate change.","https://archive.is/0rCOK,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=99931,https://climatereanalyzer.org/,https://climatereanalyzer.org/about/,https://climatereanalyzer.org/about/datasets.php,https://climatechange.umaine.edu/people/sean-birkel/,https://climatereanalyzer.org/wx/DailySummary/#t2anom,https://climatereanalyzer.org/reanalysis/daily_maps/?dm_id=world-ced&wm_id=t2anom,https://climatereanalyzer.org/reanalysis/monthly_tseries/,https://climate.anu.edu.au/about/people/academics/professor-mark-howden,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/202011/supplemental/page-2,https://www.climate.gov/about,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/11/1880-2020,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/climatereanalyzer.org/about/,https://climatereanalyzer.org/reanalysis/monthly_tseries/,https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/explore/,https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1079042,https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/temperature-change#:~:text=When%20the%20carbon%20dioxide%20concentration,goes%20down%2C%20temperature%20goes%20down.,https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide,http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/index.shtml?ref=hdr,http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/change/#tabs=Tracker&tracker=timeseries&tQ=graph%3Dtmean%26area%3Daus%26season%3D0112%26ave_yr%3D0,http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/change/index.shtml#tabs=Tracker&tracker=global-timeseries&tQ=graph%3Dglobal_t%26region%3Dglobal%26season%3D0112,http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/aus/#:~:text=2019%20was%20Australia's%20warmest%20year%20on%20record%2C%20with%20the%20annual,1.33%20%C2%B0C%20in%202013.,http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/season/aus/summary.shtml#:~:text=parts%20of%20Australia-,Temperatures,1.81%20%C2%B0C%20in%202014).,http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/?utm_source=media-release&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sotc,http://media.bom.gov.au/releases/805/state-of-the-climate-2020-shows-continued-warming-and-increase-in-extreme-weather-events/,https://www.csiro.au/,https://people.csiro.au/B/J/Jaclyn-Brown",Craig Kelly ‘year of global cooling’ claim a load of hot air,,,,,,

The comment “NICE!” has been added with an arrow pointing to the circled word.In the comments on the post, one user has written, “Wonder what the % is? Probably the same as covid…”, to which the post author replied: “Much higher than the 0.04% mortality rate of C…”At the time of writing, the December 10 post had been shared 70 times and attracted more than 65 reactions and comments. A Facebook post highlights the word “deaths” in an FDA document on COVID-19 vaccine surveillance. The AnalysisWith the US suffering the world’s highest recorded death toll from COVID-19, the FDA issued an emergency-use authorisation (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 11 to combat the virus.In a statement accompanying the announcement, FDA commissioner Stephen M. Hahn described the EUA as “a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world”.Nevertheless, polls show many Americans are reluctant to take a COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of side-effects due to the speed at which treatments have been developed cited as a primary concern.The Facebook post image draws attention to the inclusion of “deaths” in the list of “possible adverse event outcomes”.The source of the original text featured in the image, minus the drawn-in elements, is an FDA advisory committee meeting in late October (pg 15-16). An FDA spokeswoman confirmed to AAP FactCheck via email that the source was an official briefing document for the October 22 meeting.However, the spokeswoman added: “No specific vaccine was discussed at that meeting, but rather that meeting was held to discuss – in general – the criteria FDA may take into account when making a decision about emergency use authorisation for a COVID-19 vaccine.“The list of adverse events on slide 16 is a list of possible outcomes that the FDA may potentially monitor for when conducting safety surveillance. This slide was not referring to a particular vaccine candidate.”Neither of the FDA’s fact sheets on the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine for patients or health care providers mention death among its possible side effects.The only items on the FDA’s “working list”, as featured in the Facebook post, that are included in the possible side effects are joint pain and allergic reactions, although the fact sheet for patients notes “serious and unexpected side effects may occur” from taking the vaccine and it was still being studied.A fact check by The Associated Press (AP) after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received EUA approval found that social media posts claiming the FDA was intentionally burying the vaccine’s possible “life-threatening” side effects had misrepresented the same slide.The Pfizer-BioNTech has also been falsely connected to deaths that occurred during its phase three trial, as previously explained by AAP FactCheck.A week after issuing the first approval, the FDA issued an EUA for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine. Fact sheets on the vaccine (see here and here) provide similar side effect warnings to those for the Pfizer-BioNTech product. They do not mention death as a possible outcome.The Facebook post’s author also suggests in the comments that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 0.04%, however previous AAP FactCheck investigations have shown the death rate among those infected with the coronavirus is likely more than 10 times this figure (see here, here and here). The FDA has given emergency authorisation for two COVID-19 vaccines to be administered.","https://archive.vn/qF3OX,https://archive.vn/66GJW,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19,https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/15/public-confidence-looms-as-us-rolls-out-pfizer-vaccine,https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download?fbclid=IwAR1b3B-0mqjAm6quud6unQ5vGKhu93-I9VNfJtjKzui5asQHenyIurf1g5c,https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download,https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9862472416?fbclid=IwAR1KNaBAia_vokUUxwciOGsSA0I2Lss7krvFstWle67eht87knqBcJF6s4o,https://www.aap.com.au/reports-spread-misinformation-on-pfizer-vaccine-trial-deaths/,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid,https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download,https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download,https://www.aap.com.au/is-there-more-chance-of-an-asteroid-hitting-earth-than-dying-from-covid-19/,https://www.aap.com.au/death-rate-figures-for-covid-19-dont-add-up/,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-facts101-marked-d-for-deceptive/",FDA note used out of context to suggest COVID-19 vaccines cause death,,,,,,

Across the ditch, New Zealand’s emissions went up by four per cent, and this was achieved using some fancy accounting sidesteps involving forestry.”Professor Judith Sloan, economist, December 15, 2020.The AnalysisAs the Australian government faces international pressure to set stricter greenhouse gas emissions targets, it has been suggested the country is doing better than its neighbour, New Zealand.Australia was controversially not given a speaking spot at a recent UN climate change summit, while the government was criticised for not committing to a net-zero emissions target.Writing in The Australian newspaper on December 15, contributing economics editor Judith Sloan said New Zealand and Canada had also not been given speaking slots at the summit and suggested Australia was, in reality, doing better than its Commonwealth cousins, despite their governments declaring climate change emergencies.“So let’s take a look at the facts,” Prof Sloan wrote. “Between 2005 and 2018, Australia reduced its emissions by 13 per cent. Across the ditch, New Zealand’s emissions went up by four per cent, and this was achieved using some fancy accounting sidesteps involving forestry.”AAP FactCheck examined the claim Australia’s emissions have reduced while New Zealand’s have increased during this period.Prof Sloan is an honorary professorial fellow at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne, a commentator and a regular columnist for The Australian newspaper.At the time of publication, AAP FactCheck’s attempts to contact Prof Sloan for details about the sources of her information were unsuccessful.However, both New Zealand and Australia report regularly on their greenhouse emissions as part of international climate change agreements.The years 2005 and 2018, cited by Prof Sloan, are significant for both countries. The Kyoto Protocol came into force in 2005 and that is also the base year for New Zealand and Australia’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, while 2018 is the most recent reporting period under the deal.Emissions can be reported as both gross emissions, which show the total greenhouse emissions from a country, and net emissions, which account for changes in land use and forestry.For example, if forest areas are cleared, this adds to net emissions, while the addition of forest cuts net emissions. In reports, this is accounted for as land use, land-use change and forestry emissions (LULUCF).Both New Zealand and Australia account for changes in LULUCF emissions when calculating their net emissions.A comparison of both countries’ net emissions for the 14 years from 2005 to 2018 (inclusive) shows that both New Zealand and Australia’s emissions decreased during this period, although Australia’s emissions decreased at a higher rate.The Interactive Emissions Tracker from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory report, released in April, show that between 2005 and 2018, NZ’s net emissions decreased by 0.86 per cent from 55.945 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO₂-e) in 2005 to 55.468 Mt CO₂-e in 2018.A summary of the inventory report said net emissions were influenced by the planting and harvest cycle of forestry, and historical planting rates and harvesting cycles have a large impact on net emissions in any given year (page 3).Australia published its National Greenhouse Gas Inventory report in May, which showed net emissions declined by 12.92 per cent, from 617.2 Mt CO₂-e in 2005 to 537.4 Mt CO₂-e in 2018 (Table ES.01, page xiv).The biggest contributor to Australia’s reduction was from changes in forest cover, which went from being a net contributor to emissions to being a significant carbon sink during this period (Table 2.1 page 35).Prof Sloan suggests net emissions figures may be misleading as New Zealand uses “fancy accounting sidesteps”, so AAP FactCheck also analysed gross emissions over this period.Australia’s gross emissions increased over this period, whereas New Zealand’s gross emissions decreased at a greater rate than its net emissions.According to the NZ Ministry for the Environment’s Interactive Emissions Tracker, between 2005 and 2018 NZ’s gross emissions declined by three per cent from 81.274 Mt CO₂-e to 78.862 Mt CO₂-e.AAP FactCheck was unable to find figures for gross emissions in Australia’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory report. However, it did include a breakdown of emissions by sector and AAP FactCheck calculated the gross emissions by removing LULUCF changes from the net figures (Table 2.1, page 35).LULUCF changes added 91 Mt CO₂-e to the country’s net emissions in 2005, and reduced its emissions by 20.6 Mt CO₂-e in 2018. When the LULUCF changes were deducted from the net emissions it showed Australia’s gross emissions increased by 5.8 per cent over this period, from 526.2Mt CO₂-e to 556.8Mt CO₂-e.AAP FactCheck also compared emissions per capita during this period based on official population figures for New Zealand and Australia (2005 here and 2018 here).Emissions in both countries decreased on a per capita basis; Australia had a greater decrease in net emissions per person, while New Zealand had a greater decrease in gross emissions.Between 2005 and 2018, Australia’s net emissions per capita decreased by 29.2 per cent to 0.0000213 Mt CO₂-e, while gross emissions decreased by 14 per cent to 0.0000221 Mt CO₂-e. NZ’s net emissions per capita decreased by 16.4 per cent to 0.0000112 Mt CO₂-e, while gross emissions decreased 18.5 per cent to 0.0000159 Mt CO₂-e.It should be noted that on a per capita basis Australia’s emissions were much higher than New Zealand’s.Australia’s net emissions were 90 per cent higher than NZ’s in 2018, and gross emissions were 38 per cent higher. Based on OECD figures, NZ had the fifth highest gross emissions per capita in the OECD in 2018, while Australia had the highest emissions per capita.Australian National University honorary associate professor Hugh Saddler is an expert in greenhouse gas emissions accounting. Dr Saddler said gross emissions were a better way to compare the true emissions of each country and removing the LULUCF emissions from Australia’s net emissions provided a comparable figure for NZ’s gross figures.“The gross emissions provide an apples with apples comparison,” he said. “It gives a much better representation of the progress each country is making in moving towards a net-zero economy.”Dr Saddler said comparing gross emissions on a per capita basis would also be fairer.He said the methods used to estimate LULUCF emissions by both countries were robust and subject to a rigorous review process undertaken by experts from other countries.“I know about this process, because I was for some years one of these experts and took part in reviews of a number of other countries,” he said. “I would therefore be astonished if New Zealand was able to undertake ‘fancy accounting sidesteps’.”Dr Saddler said because Australia’s per capita emissions were much higher than New Zealand’s, the larger country would need to reduce its emissions at a much greater rate in order to reach parity.Australia’s emissions profile also made it easier to reduce its emissions, he said. For example only 21 per cent of Australia’s electricity came from renewable sources in 2019, whereas New Zealand’s electricity was 82 per cent renewable (page 2). On a per capita basis Australia’s emissions are much higher than New Zealand’s.","https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/un-defends-excluding-morrison-from-climate-summit-canberra-livid-with-johnson-over-snub-20201211-p56mk7.html,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-target-climate-summit-president-thanks-australian-states-but-not-morrison-government,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/scott-morrison-right-to-shun-boris-johnsons-global-deep-green-club/news-story/e3638db48f654a5680c368728dc4a965,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/professor-judith-sloan,https://www.abc.net.au/qanda/judith-sloan/10643648,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/author/Judith+Sloan,https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/climate-change-and-government/emissions-reduction-targets/about-our-emissions,https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australias-climate-change-strategies/international-climate-change-commitments,https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement,https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/land-use--land-use-change-and-forestry-lulucf,https://emissionstracker.mfe.govt.nz/#NrAMBoEYF12TwCIByBTALo2wBM4eiQAc2RSAxAJ6oCGATgPoBGAruugPYB2W0QA,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/state-of-our-atmosphere-and-climate/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-inventory,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-inventory-1990-2018-snapshot.pdf,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-2018,https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/nga-national-inventory-report-2018-volume-1.pdf,https://emissionstracker.mfe.govt.nz/#NrAMBoEYF12TwCIByBTALo2wBM4eiQAc2RSAxAJ6oCGATgPoBGAruugPYB2W0QA,https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/population,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/8486924370CD6CB2CA2571EF007D51B2?opendocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/3101.0Media%20Release1Dec%202018,https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AIR_GHG,https://energy.anu.edu.au/about-us/people/academics/honorary-associate-professor-hugh-saddler#acton-tabs-link--tabs-person_tabs-middle-2,https://www.energy.gov.au/data/renewables#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2021%25%20of%20Australia's,recorded%20in%20the%20early%201970s.,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11679-energy-in-new-zealand-2020",Has Australia cut its greenhouse emissions faster than New Zealand?,,,,,,

What is true is that the text underneath the photo is accurate. The world’s largest living organism was discovered in Malheur National Forest, in eastern Oregon.Thomas Volk is a professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin La-Crosse and runs a website dedicated to the study of fungi. On his frequently asked questions page, Prof Volk writes that “the largest fungal fruiting bodies known are…only about 300 lb (136kg)”.He confirmed to AAP FactCheck that the image had been “definitely Photoshopped”.“I know the people in the picture, from Berkeley (University of California),” he said in an email. “However, there definitely is a very large underground fungus in Malheur.”The image originated from Tom Bruns of the University of California at Berkeley, apparently as a joke.The website, Waffles At Noon, said an analysis of the image showed signs of digital manipulation, particularly around the edges of the mushroom. The site also pointed out that if the photo was genuine such an amazing sight would have been widely documented by the media and scientists.Prof Volk told AAP FactCheck that the text accompanying the image is factual.Armillaria ostoyae, popularly known as the honey mushroom, was declared the world’s largest organism in 2000 and spread through 2,200 acres of the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It is described by the US Department of Agriculture as “the largest known root disease centre in the world”.Armillaria ostoyae is a parasitic fungi that grows from a single fertilised white spore. It spreads through hyphae, which are threadlike filaments that bunched together are known as rhizomorphs. These rhizomorphs grow underground and can create enormous networks, also called mats, as is the case in Malheur National Forest.An article by That Oregon Life from January 2020 reported that the concentration of the fungus in Malheur National Forest spanned “3.5 square miles (906 hectares)” as of 2015. The fungus also weighed at least 7,500 tons (6803 tonnes) and was estimated to be 2,400-8,650 years old. A group of large mushrooms growing in a field.","https://archive.is/Mzyj9,https://www.fs.usda.gov/malheur/,https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/tvolk/,https://web.archive.org/web/20121227045457/http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/,https://web.archive.org/web/20130104084742/http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/faq.html,https://nature.berkeley.edu/brunslab/people/tb.html,http://wafflesatnoon.com/debunking-the-worlds-largest-mushroom-photo/,http://wafflesatnoon.com/debunking-the-worlds-largest-mushroom-photo/,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/web.archive.org/web/20150302152114/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/oregons-monster-mushroom-is-worlds-biggest-living-thing-710278.html,https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_033146.pdf,https://www.britannica.com/science/Armillaria-ostoyae,https://thatoregonlife.com/2020/01/largest-organism-humongous-fungus/",There’s nothing magical about fake monster mushroom pic,,,,,,
41,,,,False,,2020-12-22,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/quantum-physicists-arent-crazy-in-love-with-dirac-meme/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA meme that links “the most beautiful equation in physics”, the Dirac equation, with quantum entanglement and human love, has resurfaced on Facebook.A revised version of the meme, the precursor of dates back at least five years, has been posted by a New Zealand Facebook user. At the time of the publication it had been shared more than 580 times and attracted more than 3.4 million views.The latest version of the meme includes a photo of a tattoo representing the Dirac equation, which is a equation discovered by British physicist Paul Dirac and published in 1928.The photo is accompanied by a section of prose: “She asked him, ‘Tell me something nice!’ He answered her, ‘(∂ + m) ps = 0’ This is the equation of Dirac, the most beautiful equation in physics. It describes the phenomenon of quantum connection, which alleges that if two separate systems interact with each other over a certain period of time and then separate, we can describe them as two different systems, but they will already exist as one unique system. What happens to one will continue to affect the other, regardless of the distance between them. It’s called quantum intertwining or quantum connection. Two particles that were at some point connected remain connected forever, even if they are light-years apart. This is what happens to two people when they are connected by what we humans call Love.”The words are attributed to “Unknown”. A social media meme links the Dirac equation with quantum entanglement and human love. The AnalysisIn a journal article published in the May 1963 issue of Scientific American, physicist Paul Dirac wrote that “it is more important to have beauty in one’s equations than to have them fit experiment”.The Dirac equation is regarded as “the most beautiful equation in physics”, but this doesn’t mean his famous equation can be used to describe or understand human love, despite claims that there are parallels between the two.Examples of Dirac’s published work can be found in Scientific American while his contribution to physics is explained in this video and also in an interview with Dirac himself.The post makes two main claims: that the Dirac equation describes the phenomenon of quantum connection; and that quantum connection, or entanglement (described as the continuing impact of one system on another even after separation) is what happens between people in love.Dirac describes the development of general physical theory as a process of evolution, in which his major contribution was to expand on advancements made by physicists Newton, Einstein, Heisenberg and Schrodinger. Even so, he described his own work as “a stepping stone toward the better stages we shall have in the future”.Dr Maarten Hoogerland, a senior lecturer in physics at the University of Auckland and an expert in the quantum world, told AAP FactCheck the Dirac equation “essentially folds relativity into quantum physics”.The Dirac equation enabled physicists to better understand the nature and activity of very small objects (quantum physics), by applying the knowledge gained by Einstein’s theory of relativity, which before the Dirac equation had not been possible.As BBC Earth explains it, the Dirac equation “brought together two of the most important ideas in science: quantum mechanics, which describes the behaviour of tiny objects; and Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which describes the behaviour of fast-moving objects. As a result, Dirac’s equation describes how particles like electrons behave when they travel close to the speed of light”.“You need (the equation) to describe the way atoms, the building blocks of everything, are put together,” Dr Hoogerland told AAP FactCheck.“Inside an atom, electrons move fairly fast and you do need a relativistic correction to be part of that.”Thomas Pashby, an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, whose research concerns the interpretation of quantum mechanics, told AAP FactCheck the Dirac equation described a single electron: “It is notable for providing an elementary description of the electron in a hydrogen atom which gets the energy levels almost exactly right (apart from some small corrections from quantum field theory).”Asst Prof Pashby confirmed the photo of the tattoo in the post was the Dirac equation, but that the equation was incorrectly written in the post itself ((∂ + m) ps = 0), since it was missing the “Feynman slash notation”.He said the interpretative part of the text was “essentially nonsense” and entanglement was not a phenomenon the Dirac equation describes “since it applies to a single electron”.Dr Hoogerland said the post’s attempt to transpose quantum entanglement onto human love was “fairly ridiculous”.“I have no doubt that this love business is real forces but it’s not physics,” he told AAP FactCheck.Dr Hoogerland also said the Dirac equation did not describe quantum entanglement, and was “fairly unrelated” to it.“Entanglement is essentially completely something different because it doesn’t need relativity,” he said. “At least not in this way. What can happen if you carefully prepare two particles in what we call an entangled state, where one always ends up affecting what happens to the other no matter how far apart they are, this is actually true but it is very hard to observe in real life.“We need to be very, very careful in our entangling something in a controllable manner and so in real life it’s very hard to say this would ever be of any influence.”Dr Hoogerland did agree that the Dirac equation was beautiful.“It is a beautiful equation in its relative simplicity. As physicists we are always really attracted to something that looks simple. However, to actually calculate something with it is not trivial. But it is a part of what physics research is doing all the time.” To transpose quantum entanglement to human love is ridiculous, an expert told AAP FactCheck.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=198888058407389&set=a.113700493592813&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10207109169868736&id=998370040175990,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Dirac,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-25/love-quantum-physics-and-entanglement,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYkaahzFWfo&feature=youtu.be,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et8-gg6XNDY&feature=youtu.be,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/,http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/people/profile/m-hoogerland,http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160120-the-most-beautiful-equation-is-the-dirac-equation,https://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/pashby,https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Feynman+slash+notation",Quantum physicists aren’t crazy in love with Dirac meme,,,,,,
42,,,,False,,2020-12-21,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/chill-out-cold-storage-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-are-legitimate/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA post shared by a New Zealand Facebook user claims cold-storage vaccines are not legitimate and are aimed at genetic manipulation.“Any vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn’t a vaccine. It’s a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material,” the post reads.“Don’t let them fool you. This is genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale. Shut it down.”The post, which is from a November 15 tweet by The Disruptive Physician, Doc Evenhouse, has been shared on Facebook multiple times (here, here, here and here). A post shared by a NZ Facebook user claims that cold-storage vaccines aren’t legitimate vaccines. The AnalysisThe post makes two claims about vaccines that are incorrect. Many vaccines are routinely stored at sub-zero temperatures and the idea that cold-storage COVID-19 vaccines are a transfection agent that cause “genetic manipulation” is biologically impossible, experts say.While the Facebook post does not mention a specific vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine created by Pfizer and BioNTech must be stored between -70 to -80C.  That vaccine is currently being rolled out in the United Kingdom and in the United States.A chart by the American Academy of Pediatrics lists several vaccines which require sub-zero temperatures for storage. Other vaccines such as that for Ebola virus, was stored at -80C, according to the World Health Organization.Regarding the post’s claims, Dr Nikki Turner, director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre at the University of Auckland told AAP FactCheck in an email: “The simple answer is this (post) is completely incorrect.”Vaccinologist Dr Helen Petousis-Harris, a member of the New Zealand Vaccine Safety Expert Advisory Group and director of the University of Auckland’s Vaccine Datalink and Research Group, also rejected the claims made about the COVID-19 vaccine.“(It) is a very peculiar statement. … It is very much a vaccine in that it is a biological agent used to induce immunity to a disease in those to whom it is administered,” Dr Petousis-Harris told AAP FactCheck in an email.The Pfizer vaccine and another by Moderna, use messenger RNA (mRNA), a molecule that puts DNA instructions into action. Instead of putting a weak or inactive germ into the body as many vaccines do, the mRNA vaccines cause the body to make a protein that triggers an immune response, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).These vaccines need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures to keep the delicate mRNA material intact, according to Margaret Liu, a vaccine researcher who chairs the board of the International Society for Vaccines. Liu told National Public Radio (NPR) in the US that mRNA is “really easily destroyed, and that’s because there are many, many enzymes that will just break it apart”.A spokesman for the Auckland Immunisation Advisory Centre agreed and explained to AAP FactCheck that it is “the mRNA technology (e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine that requires the colder storage and transportation. This temperature is required to preserve the mRNA material and prevent it from breaking down.”As of December 18, the New Zealand government has made arrangements to purchase four COVID-19 vaccines for use – Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Novavax and AstraZeneca. The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine New Zealand agreed to buy, with a total of 1.5 million doses ordered. It will be transported and stored at -70C.The post also claims that the vaccines are “a transfection agent,” meant to cause global genetic manipulation. But this misrepresents how mRNA vaccines work.“Transfection” means introducing nucleic acids – DNA or RNA – into a cell, according to the biotechnology company Sigma-Aldrich. The process is outlined in a video here.Dr Petousis-Harris told AAP Factcheck that RNA vaccines “are not transfection agents aimed at genetic manipulation”.“There is no ability of RNA vaccines to, in any way, modify or manipulate our genomes,” she said.“One reason is because the RNA cannot gain access to our genome, another is that it does not have the capability to integrate into it. Therefore this is a biological impossibility.”A fact sheet by the CDC also states that “(mRNA vaccines) do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.”The post also claims that the vaccine is “kept alive so it can infect your cells,” however the CDC notes that “mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus and do not carry a risk of causing disease” in a vaccinated person.“mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA.”Similar claims have been previously debunked here, here and here. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is placed in cold storage at Indiana University Health.","https://archive.is/UUbJN,https://archive.is/QWHlI,https://twitter.com/docevenhouse?lang=en,https://archive.is/6nsRq,https://archive.is/FPXe0,https://archive.is/4tst9,https://archive.is/tmQXa,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-celebrate-historic-first-authorization,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/11/statement-hhs-dod-on-fda-emergency-use-authorization-covid-19-vaccine-candidate.html,https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Practice-Management/Pages/vaccine-storage-chart.aspx,https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2352-3964(19)30651-6/fulltext,https://www.who.int/features/2015/guinea-ebola-vaccine/en/,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/n-turner,https://www.immune.org.nz/about,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/hpet002,https://www.immune.org.nz/research/vaccine-safety-expert-advisory-group,https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/soph/about/our-departments/general-practice-and-primary-health-care/our-research/vaccine-datalink-and-research-group.html,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-european-commissions-approval-advance-purchase,https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/messenger-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica,https://isv-online.org/,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-response-planning/covid-19-vaccine-planning#purchase,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/first-covid-19-vaccine-purchase-agreement-signed,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/covid_19_vaccine_u_s_distribution_fact_sheet#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20can%20be%20stored,2%2D8%C2%B0C%20conditions.,https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/transfection-reagents.html,https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/video/life-science/how-transfection-works.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/mrna-vaccine-basics.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/08/fact-check-vaccines-negative-80-degrees-transfection-agents-infect-cells/?fbclid=IwAR3iR4210UjJVLMgBw-cyw2yH6C8ioSTD2BCfca2ujcOi0XAmNLJ16WfKC0,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-mrna-vaccine-storage-temp-idUSKBN28E28D,https://factcheck.afp.com/experts-refute-false-claim-covid-19-vaccine-can-manipulate-human-genes",Chill out: Cold-storage mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are legitimate,,,,,,

Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable DevelopmentThe post’s list of 17 goals twist the real goals to align with conspiracy theories. For example, there is no mention of the terms “communism” or “one world government” in the UN’s SDG, whereas those terms appear in the Facebook post.A United Nations spokeswoman confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email: “These are not UN documents and the claims are false”.The 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals have constantly been targeted by conspiracy theorists, as were the Agenda 21 goals that preceded them.AAP FactCheck previously found a claim which featured a document supposedly listing the “Agenda 21/2030 Mission Goals” to be false, with a UN spokesperson saying the post was “not a genuine UN document”.The UN’s Agenda 21 was a non-binding resolution agreed to at the UN’s 1992 Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. It pushed nations to take a balanced and integrated approach to environment and development questions. The Agenda 21 resolution preceded the Millenium Development Goals.The Southern Poverty Law Centre, a US civil rights group with a background in monitoring extremism, produced a report in 2014 describing how conspiracy theorists viewed Agenda 21 as “a comprehensive plan of utopian environmentalism, social engineering, and global political control”.While the 2030 resolution was adopted by all UN member countries, it is not legally binding and the implementation of these goals “will rely on countries’ own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes, and will be led by countries”, according to the SDG Frequently Asked Questions. Australian PM Scott Morrison speaks during a session of the United Nations General Assembly.","https://archive.vn/e7dRV,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/archive.vn/05EnP,https://archive.vn/6Upz0,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/archive.vn/CFefT,https://archive.vn/OgZa9,https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/,https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&Lang=E,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/millennium-development-goals-(mdgs),https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/,https://www.aap.com.au/fake-un-document-used-to-spread-false-new-world-order-goals/,https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Agenda21.pdf,https://www.splcenter.org/20140331/agenda-21-un-sustainability-and-right-wing-conspiracy-theory,https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/",Fake UN Sustainable Development Goals surface again,,,,,,

A caption accompanying the video, which appears to be playing on a mobile phone, reads, “This video was made 64years (sic) ago – Take note to listen to the last 45 seconds on the video as well.”The video begins with the narrator saying, “When you think of the future, you likely envision the remarkable technologies that you’ve seen in comic books and films.” The audio is accompanied by footage of flying cars and household robots among other imagery.The video goes on to note that the future “isn’t without its darker sides”.“Perhaps worst of all will be the emergence of a deadly and potentially devastating disease. Experts predict that by the year 2020, a new virus will rise, spreading from somewhere in Asia to the rest of the world,” the narrator says.“A sickness which would have been contained in years past will quickly spread to all corners of the globe.”The Facebook post includes the caption, “Very very interesting. The future is now they say…”At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 195 times and viewed more than 15,000 times. A video shared by a Facebook user is supposedly from 1956 and it predicts a pandemic in 2020. The AnalysisNostradamus need not worry about the rise of rival prognosticators – the video included in the post is a satirical YouTube creation that was uploaded in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Facebook post only shows half of the original four-minute video, which was uploaded to YouTube on March 1, 2020 by user “RamsesThePigeon”.In the description on the video, “Ramses,” who is actually writer and satirist Max Patrick Schlienger, writes: “It’s hilarious to look back on what people from the 1950s thought the future would be like.” He said it drew on public domain video footage acquired from Archive.org.For example, the footage seen in the video at 19 seconds of a “house-cleaning robot” is from a 1940 educational film called, Leave It To Roll-Oh.AAP FactCheck contacted Schlienger, who acknowledged that the video was satirical.“I created the piece in question. The video itself is an amalgam of public-domain footage from commercials, movies, and PSAs, and the voiceover is my own work,” he said in an email.Footage from the unedited YouTube video makes it even clearer it’s a parody with lines like “children would prefer to attempt the carefree murder of their playmates rather than lecture one another about covering their mouths when they cough”.It also cuts to a vintage 1954 commercial for Doeskin dinner napkins and concludes with a joke ending, promising to deliver “the answer for how to avoid the deadly virus” which is then immediately followed by a title card saying “footage missing”.Edited versions of the original video have been shared many times on Facebook – including here, here, here and here.Schlienger hosted a question-and-answer session on Reddit about his video. He noted that his satire was being shared around the internet in misleading contexts.“The piece was originally intended to lampoon the anti-science perspectives that were beginning to crop up at the start of this year … and the fact that my work is now being used to support those perspectives is disheartening,” he told AAP FactCheck.Schlienger also offered this advice to viewers in his Reddit post: “As a final thought, remember to question the veracity of (and the motivations behind) what you see, hear, and read… because it might end up being a joke.”The video has been previously debunked as satire here, here and here. People wearing face masks to protect against COVID-19 has become part of life during the pandemic.","https://archive.is/dV3jM,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19,https://youtu.be/tCZu8a5r5y4,http://ramsesthepigeon.com,https://www.nearlydeparted.net/bio.html,https://archive.org,https://archive.org/details/LeaveItt1940,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCZu8a5r5y4&feature=youtu.be,https://archive.org/details/DoeskinDinnerNapkins1954,https://archive.vn/V4N6H,https://archive.vn/vWf6P,https://archive.vn/4EOx4,https://archive.vn/4l5tI,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j661lm/iama_writer_absurdist_and_satirist_who_recently/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j661lm/iama_writer_absurdist_and_satirist_who_recently/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/avoiding-future-plague-psa/,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-this-viral-1950s-public-service-announcement-on-covid-19-is-not-what-it-seems-1734434-2020-10-23,https://www.thatsnonsense.com/is-1956-avoiding-the-future-plague-video-real-fact-check/","No, this video didn’t predict today’s coronavirus pandemic in 1956",,,,,,
45,,,,Misleading,,2020-12-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-making-an-electric-car-use-twice-the-emissions-of-a-standard-model/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Does manufacturing an electric vehicle produce twice the greenhouse emissions of a fossil-fuel powered car?The Statement“The construction of an electric car takes double the amount of carbon emissions than an internal combustion engine car or traditional car does.”Matt Canavan, Queensland Senator, The Nationals, December 10, 2020.The AnalysisQueensland Senator Matt Canavan has questioned the environmental benefits of electric cars, claiming that it takes twice the greenhouse gas emissions to produce the vehicles compared to those with internal combustion engines.The Australian National Party senator, an advocate for building more fossil fuel-fired power stations, made the comments after Infrastructure Victoria released a draft 30-year strategy for the state to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The first of its 85 recommendations was to accelerate the uptake of zero-emission vehicles (page 16).During an interview on Sky News, a clip of which was posted to Facebook on December 10, Mr Canavan compared the strategy to the Soviet Union’s five-year plans under leader Joseph Stalin and questioned whether electric vehicles (EVs) would help reduce greenhouse emissions. (Video mark 1min 23 sec).“Presumably they’re saying they want everybody driving electric cars because they think it’s going to save the planet, but the construction of an electric car takes double – double – the amount of carbon emissions than an internal combustion engine car, or a traditional car does,” Mr Canavan said.“It can make up those carbon emissions over the life of the car depending on where you get the electricity from, but if you’re in Victoria you’ll get about 70 per cent of your electricity from coal right now.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Canavan’s statement that EVs produce double the greenhouse emissions of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) during manufacturing.When contacted to provide evidence in support of the claim, Mr Canavan’s office emailed a list of sources.They included a 2019 Forbes article discussing whether EVs were better for the environment than ICEVs.The article said EVs were often criticised due to the pollution caused by manufacturing EV batteries, but it noted one report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found these emissions were highly dependent on where the batteries were produced.It said another study, which compared emissions from EVs and ICEVs manufactured in China, found EVs produced up to 60 per cent more CO2 during production than ICEVs, but these emissions could be reduced by up to 66 per cent “if they adopted American or European manufacturing techniques”.“As such, the pollution created through the extraction process and production of batteries remains on par or slightly higher than the manufacturing process of petrol or diesel-based engines,” the article said.It said EVs would also become more efficient in future and produced considerably lower emissions over their lifetime compared with an ICEV, regardless of the electricity mix used to power them.The second source Mr Canavan’s office supplied was the ICCT report cited in the Forbes article. It looked at the manufacturing emissions of EV batteries and found estimates varied significantly, from 56 kilograms of carbon dioxide-equivalent per kilowatt-hour of battery capacity (kg CO2e/kWh) to 494kg CO2e/kWh (page 2).“The wide range of values found in these studies indicates the degree of uncertainty in assessing life-cycle emissions and the variety of methods and materials used in manufacturing batteries,” it said.It noted that the largest share of manufacturing emissions came from the electricity used to produce the battery, adding that using cleaner power sources in factories would significantly reduce the carbon footprint.The report also compared emissions for a 2017 Nissan Leaf with those from an “average European car” from 2015 and a 2017 Peugeot 208 (page 4). It said manufacturing emissions for the EV were roughly double those for the ICEV vehicles (Figure 1, page 5).But over its life cycle, the Leaf’s emissions were about 50 per cent lower after 150,000km “even when assuming relatively high battery manufacturing emissions”.The modelling assumed that manufacturing the Leaf’s battery produced 175kg CO2e/kWh, a figure that other research suggests may be outdated.A 2019 Swedish review assumed EV battery manufacturing emissions of between 61 and 106kg CO2e/kWh after factoring in the use of renewable energy in the production process.The third source Mr Canavan’s office provided was a 2020 article by Transport & Environment, an organisation which describes itself as “Europe’s leading clean transport campaign group”.The article, titled How Clean Are Electric Cars?, compared the emissions from EVs in countries with different levels of renewable electricity in their grids. It showed the emissions from manufacturing EVs was significantly higher than for ICEVs but not quite double.The report showed EVs produced significantly lower emissions over their life cycles in all modelled countries. Even in Poland, where only around 13 per cent of electricity came from renewable sources in 2018, the EV had 29 per cent lower emissions than an average diesel or petrol powered vehicle.Mr Canavan’s office also cited a fact check which examined a German study that claimed electric vehicles produced more emissions than diesel vehicles over their life cycles. The fact check found the study’s findings were mostly false. The German study has also been criticised by multiple experts (including here, here, here)AAP FactCheck‘s research found estimates for EV manufacturing emissions varied widely. The results often depend on the capacity of the battery used, whether the electricity used during manufacturing was from renewable sources and other underlying assumptions.A 2015 report by the US Union of Concerned Scientists estimated the emissions of manufacturing a mid-sized EV based on a Nissan Leaf and a “full sized” vehicle based on a Tesla Model 3, and compared these with similar ICEVs.It found on average the Leaf’s manufacturing emissions were 15 per cent higher than an ICEV, while the Tesla’s emissions were 68 per cent higher, which was mostly due to its larger battery (Figure 7, page 21). However, over the lifetime of the vehicle the Leaf’s emissions were about 51 per cent lower, while the Tesla’s emissions were 53 per cent lower than a comparable ICEV.It said EV manufacturing emissions could be reduced by around 30 per cent if a car was produced using 80 per cent renewable energy rather than the average emissions from the US energy grid (page 23).A 2016 study looked at the comparable manufacturing emissions for a Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt, Toyota Prius and a Mazda 3. It found the Nissan Leaf produced nearly double the emissions during production against the Mazda and the Toyota (pages 5-6, table 2 and 3).A 2020 study from researchers in The Netherlands compared manufacturing emissions from three EVs and three ICEV vehicles (page 5). It found manufacturing emissions of a Volkswagen eGolf were 25 per cent higher than for a Toyota Prius; emissions for a Tesla Model 3 were 59 per cent higher than for a Mercedes C-class diesel; and emissions from a Porsche Taycan S EV were 60 per cent higher than a Bugatti Veyron.A 2017 study compared EV and ICEV manufacturing emissions in China and found the EV emissions were about 50 per cent higher. Another study in China compared emissions from an EV and ICEV Ford Focus and estimated emissions were 39 per cent higher for the EV.A report by Volkswagen, released in 2019, compared the life-cycle emissions of the Volkswagen Golf powered by an electric motor and a diesel internal combustion engine. It found emissions from manufacturing the EV were nearly double that of the diesel vehicle (page 1). New technology in its new EV, the ID, reduced emissions from producing the battery by more than 25 per cent.A company webpage expanded on the research to show the EV Golf had lower lifetime emissions than the diesel version after 125,000km, based on the average EU electricity mix. However, in Germany, where 42.1 per cent of electricity generation was from renewables in 2019 (page 45), the EV had higher life-cycle emissions based on a life span of 200,000km.A 2019 report by Tesla analysed the environmental impact of its business and claimed manufacturing emissions were “nearly comparable” to an average ICEV (page 11).University of Queensland research fellow and EV researcher Jake Whitehead said the emissions from producing an electric car were generally higher than for an ICEV, but this depended on the energy used to power the manufacturing facilities.Dr Whitehead estimated EVs currently have 50 to 100 per cent higher emissions during production, but some manufacturers claimed to be approaching emissions parity with ICEVs.He said Tesla, whose Model 3 was the highest selling EV in Australia, had relatively low manufacturing emissions and its Nevada ‘Gigafactory’ was designed to have net zero emissions.He said the Volkswagen report was misleading as the electric Golf was a retrofitted ICEV vehicle and so would not be as efficient as a purpose-built EV, while the fuel-efficiency assumptions for the diesel Golf also appeared to be unrealistically high.Dr Whitehead referred to an Australian study, which he peer-reviewed, that estimated EV manufacturing emissions were 20 per cent higher than an ICEV (page 12).A report published by the European Commission (EC) in July also provided a comprehensive analysis of life-cycle emissions of EVs and found manufacturing emissions were higher but not double (Figure ES5, page 9).It also found that the average lifetime emissions for a medium-sized EV across the EU were only 45 per cent of those from a petrol-powered equivalent.“There is clear evidence that, in almost all cases EVs have lower (lifetime) emissions than ICEVs,” Dr Whitehall said.Mr Canavan is correct that 70 per cent of Victoria’s electricity comes from coal-fired power stations, with 20 per cent from renewable sources as of 2019.However, Dr Whitehall said, based on the EC report, an average EV in Victoria would produce about 20 per cent less greenhouse emissions on a life-cycle basis. Most studies show electric cars have lower life-cycle emissions than their conventional equivalents.","https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=245212,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6190765257001,https://www.infrastructurevictoria.com.au/about-us/,https://www.infrastructurevictoria.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Victorias-Draft-30-Year-Infrastructure-Strategy-Volume-1-1.pdf,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=139001731100659,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Five-Year-Plans,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/05/20/are-electric-vehicles-really-better-for-the-environment/?sh=2a52587576d2,https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610217309049,https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339237011_Lithium-Ion_Vehicle_Battery_Production_Status_2019_on_Energy_Use_CO_2_Emissions_Use_of_Metals_Products_Environmental_Footprint_and_Recycling,https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/downloads/T%26E%E2%80%99s%20EV%20life%20cycle%20analysis%20LCA.pdf,https://www.transportenvironment.org/about-us,https://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/en/defaultaktualnosci/3304/3/11/1/energy_from_renewable_sources_in_2018.pdf,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-electric-cars-generate-higher-emissions-than-diesel-cars/,https://www.xn--starterset-elektromobilitt-4hc.de/content/3-Infothek/2-Publikationen/29-abschlussbericht-bewertung-der-praxistauglichkeit-und-umweltwirkungen-von-elektrofahrzeugen/now_handbuch_elektrofahrzeuge_web.pdf,https://www.oliver-krischer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/English_Studie.pdf,https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/electric-car-%E2%80%98hatchet-job%E2%80%99-debunked,https://twitter.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1120327764543004672?s=19,https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf,https://www.ucsusa.org/about,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300084729_Effect_of_regional_grid_mix_driving_patterns_and_climate_on_the_comparative_carbon_footprint_of_gasoline_and_plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_the_United_States,https://www.oliver-krischer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/English_Studie.pdf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261917305433,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304007987_Cradle-to-Gate_Emissions_from_a_Commercial_Electric_Vehicle_Li-Ion_Battery_A_Comparative_Analysis,https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/electric-vehicles-with-lowest-co2-emissions-4886,https://www.volkswagen.co.nz/en/brand/news/vision-made-reality--world-premiere-of-the-id-3.html,https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2019/04/from-the-well-to-the-wheel.html#,https://www.erneuerbare-energien.de/EE/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/zeitreihen-zur-entwicklung-der-erneuerbaren-energien-in-deutschland-1990-2019-en.pdf;jsessionid=6A78EED3CE821B7F28A638B27D1AA72D?__blob=publicationFile&v=11,https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16964,https://thedriven.io/2020/09/21/top-four-plug-in-vehicles-sold-in-australia-are-all-electric/,https://www.tesla.com/en_NZ/gigafactory,https://51431d88-662c-4884-b7bc-b5b93a225b7d.filesusr.com/ugd/d0bd25_bbeb4c905a2b4121b0ef3870648f78cf.pdf,https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1f494180-bc0e-11ea-811c-01aa75ed71a1,https://www.energy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Australian_energy_statistics_2020_infographic_VIC.PDF",Does

46,,,,Missing Context,,2020-12-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/are-plant-based-meats-just-another-persons-poison/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post questions whether plant-based meats are healthier than natural meats by listing how some ingredients used in the foods also feature in toxic products.A Facebook user, whose location is listed as Wellington, New Zealand and who describes herself as the “chairman and CEO at NZ Truth Warriors”, posted the meme on December 10.It features a chemical plant as a background image and highlights five claimed ingredients in plant-based meats alongside how they are used in other products: titanium dioxide (whitener used in paint); methylcellulose (bulking agent used in laxatives); propylene glycol (liquid used in e-cigarettes); ferric phosphate (used in slug pesticide); and magnesium carbonate (used in fire-extinguishing compounds).“Think plant-based meat is healthier than natural meats?” the meme asks. “Fake meat doesn’t grow on a vine. It’s an ultra-processed imitation that is assembled in industrial factories.”At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 325 times and attracted more than 15,000 views. A post likens the processing of plant-based meats to being “assembled in industrial factories”. The AnalysisWith the possible exception of ferric phosphate, which is not on the schedule of food additives permitted in Australia and New Zealand, the meme correctly lists ingredients that may be found in plant-based meat substitutes – or “meat analogues“.The post implies the ingredients could be toxic, however experts told AAP FactCheck the additives have been used safely in many types of processed foods.While the meme does not provide a source for the information, it matches a newspaper ad linked to the US-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which has run a campaign against “fake meat”.The organisation is listed on its website as a non-profit “devoted to promoting personal responsibility and protecting consumer choices” although it has been described by the New York Times as a public-relations outfit with financial backers in the meat and food industries.On a dedicated website, it lists various ingredients contained in plant-based meat items. All of the additives included in the meme except for ferric phosphate appear in the list, although the remainder besides methylcellulose feature in only a handful of products.AAP FactCheck found the ingredients listed for products on the site to generally match the products’ listed ingredients on manufacturer or third-party sites (see sample comparisons here and here; here and here; and here and here).Nevertheless, the list does not provide a clear indication of how widely the ingredients are used.A 2019 analysis by Dr Benjamin Bohrer from the Canada’s University of Guelph of the ingredients in seven popular “modern meat analogue products”, such as the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger, did not list any of the additives with the exception of methylcellulose.To assess the safety of the five ingredients listed in the post, AAP FactCheck sought the opinion of food industry expert Gary Kennedy, the managing director of food safety consultancy Correct Food Systems.He said the post’s comparison of plant-based meat and natural meat was misleading.“One argument here is that because this is man-made it’s bad for you,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email, noting that unprocessed red meat had, for example, been linked to heart disease and cancer. Some researchers have recently suggested evidence of these negative health connections is weak.Titanium dioxide is a naturally occurring mineral powder with a wide range of applications, including as a food colouring.“It’s the white colour in paint, but it’s also the white colour in most food as well,” Mr Kennedy said.Methylcellulose is an emulsifying agent used in cosmetics, pharmaceutics and the chemical industry, and as a bulk-forming laxative.“Methylcellulose is a bulking agent. That one’s man-made, it doesn’t occur naturally,” Mr Kennedy said.“You can buy it at the pharmacist. It’s a common one you take for constipation and diarrhoea as a bulking agent.”Propylene glycol is a synthetic liquid used to absorb water and maintain moisture in some medicines, cosmetics and food products.“If you were going to pick one that would ring alarm bills, (it) is propylene glycol, also man-made,” Mr Kennedy.“It’s a common component of antifreeze, and when this one comes up people say, ‘Oh my God, that’s in antifreeze.’ And it is, but there are legal levels of propylene glycol (in food).”Ferric phosphate, also known as iron phosphate, is approved as a food additive in the US by the FDA where it is used as a nutrient supplement.“Ferric phosphate is not approved in Australia or the EU,” Mr Kennedy said. “It is approved in the US. It’s a chemical that’s actually approved in the organic farming industry as a natural pesticide. That’s why it’s found in snail bait.”Magnesium carbonate is a magnesium salt and is a common over-the-counter remedy for heartburn and upset stomachs. As a food additive, it is used as a bleaching agent or as a colour-retention agent.“You can buy magnesium carbonate as a dietary supplement. It’s commonly consumed by humans,” Mr Kennedy said.When AAP FactCheck asked whether the presence of these ingredients in plant-based meat made the products unhealthy, Mr Kennedy said they did not.“The level these are being used at are the levels they are being used in lots of other foods as well,” he said.Julian Cox, associate professor of food microbiology at the University of New South Wales, told AAP FactCheck he often sees memes like the Facebook post used “out of context”.“That is, often, some of the chemicals are indeed a natural component of the food products, or foods more generally,” Dr Cox said.“Foods are made up of chemicals. Second, and related, where such chemicals are added, rather than natural components, they have a history of use and a record of safety in food products, and are indeed approved for use by regulatory authorities.“It is misdirection to discredit by indicating their use in other products (that are) seen as harmful, suggesting these chemicals as harmful by association.” The post’s comparison of plant-based meat and natural is misleading, an expert told AAP FactCheck.","https://archive.is/Terqy,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020C00203,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142285/,https://www.facebook.com/DrPamelaRD/posts/2835283216502454?__cft__[0]=AZXtJQ0UWT7_UPyLsJ6A6vl8hLkS8IJL6SwS-6eVN25CoN1gjzNp48zExUfTdmv339TUZRecNsPNES1KPTWxLJxpUqvYSzqkwDnbGJOY4LnMa3_OVUwjx6Lw2mytNuBpnGU8FUSR6MP210XtppQmVmNEf4-k5gAw0_kT3k-ZK2qr3w&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-y-R,https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2019/05/5-chemicals-lurking-in-plant-based-meats/,https://www.consumerfreedom.com/category/fake-meat/,https://www.consumerfreedom.com/about/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/well/eat/fake-meat-vs-real-meat.html,https://wellness.consumerfreedom.com/ingredient-guide/ingredients/,https://wellness.consumerfreedom.com/product/morningstar-farms-breakfast-maple-flavored-sausage-veggie-patties/,https://www.morningstarfarms.com/en_US/products/breakfast/morningstar-farms-maple-flavored-veggie-sausage-patties-product.html,https://wellness.consumerfreedom.com/product/worthington-loma-linda-big-franks/,https://www.clnf.org/loma-linda-big-franks-20oz,https://wellness.consumerfreedom.com/product/beyond-meat-beyond-chicken-strips-grilled/,https://www.instacart.com/products/259939-beyond-meat-beyond-chicken-strips-grilled-9-0-oz,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453019301144,https://experts.uoguelph.ca/benjamin-bohrer,http://www.correctfoodsystems.com.au/uploads/3/8/9/4/38945605/190823_gkennedy_cfs_profile.pdf,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1621,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/26042,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Methylcellulose,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1030,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24861,https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1301&SearchTerm=ferric%20phosphate,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/11029,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-julian-cox",Are plant-based ‘meats’ just another person’s poison?,,,,,,

This measure must be taken to ensure the safety of all people from any electrical hazards during the cyclone. Power will only be restored once a complete and thorough inspection of the power station and power lines have been carried out.“This may take hours or days depending on severity of damage. We advise you to keep torches and other lights in hand as per your requirements.”At the time of writing, the post has been viewed more than 16,000 times, shared more than 130 times and attracted more than 190 reactions. A post claims Fiji’s energy supply will be shut before Cyclone Yasa’s “effect is at the maximum”. The AnalysisA notice purportedly from Fiji’s national power provider, EFL, claims it will “shut down the electricity supply to the whole nation without warning a few hours before the cyclone’s effect is at the maximum”.However, an EFL spokesman told AAP FactCheck the warning did not come from the company and it will “keep the power system live for as long as it is deemed safe and the power system is intact”.Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasa first emerged as a storm on December 12 before developing into a cyclone on December 14.As of December 17, Yasa was classified as a category-five cyclone, the highest category, which Fiji’s National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) says may cause “catastrophic” damage including “some complete building failures” and potential mass evacuations.Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama described Yasa as being in the category of the “world’s strongest storm”.According to Fiji’s Metservice, the nation’s meteorological organisation, the eye of Tropical Cyclone Yasa was expected to make landfall “very close to or over the province of Bua” at around 8pm on December 17 with average wind speeds of 240 km/h. Fiji’s NDMO implemented a 30-day state of natural disaster.Amid Fiji’s preparations for Yasa, a notice with the logo of energy provider EFL appeared online claiming the company will shut off power to the whole country.EFL is a government-owned energy provider, supplying electricity to around 90 per cent of Fiji.An EFL spokesman told AAP FactCheck in an email that the social media post “is not legit”.“EFL will keep the power system live and energised for as long as it is deemed safe and the power system is intact. In the event the weather condition deteriorates we will take appropriate action considering safety,” the spokesman said.The company also published a Facebook post clarifying that the notice was “not released by EFL”, urging people to “delete and do not share”.Yasa will be the fifth storm worldwide to reach category-five strength in 2020. The last time a category-five storm made landfall in Fiji was Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. It was considered to be “the strongest tropical cyclone in history to ever make landfall in Fiji”. Winston damaged or destroyed over 30,000 houses, nearly 500 schools and 88 health clinics and medical facilities. A satellite image by NASA shows the category-five Cyclone Yasa north-west of Fiji’s Viti Levu.","https://archive.vn/y3lcs,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147672/cyclone-yasa-bearing-down-on-fiji,http://www.ndmo.gov.fj/images/Hazards/Pull-up-banner_tropical-cycclone.pdf,https://archive.is/FXCZD,https://www.met.gov.fj/index.php?page=aerosum#Media%20Releases/Media%20Release%20No.14.pdf,https://twitter.com/FijiNDMO/status/1339425209074401283/photo/1,http://efl.com.fj/about-us/,https://www.facebook.com/EnergyFiji/photos/a.569808859890107/1472292862975031/,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147672/cyclone-yasa-bearing-down-on-fiji,https://www.unicef.org.au/our-work/unicef-in-emergencies/cyclone-winston",Fiji’s energy provider warns over fake cyclone ‘blackout notice’,,,,,,
48,,,,Mostly False,,2020-12-17,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/has-the-great-barrier-reefs-health-barely-changed-since-the-1980s/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is the amount of coral on the Great Barrier Reef similar now to during the 1980s?The Statement“The amount of coral, while fluctuating dramatically from year to year, is about the same today as when records began in the 1980s.”Dr Peter Ridd, marine physicist, December 6, 2020.The AnalysisA marine scientist has claimed that coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef – considered a key indicator of the reef’s health status – has barely changed since records began in the 1980s.In a column in the Australian newspaper on December 6, Dr Peter Ridd claimed reports that showed the reef was “on its last legs” were wrong.In the article, Dr Ridd criticised the findings of a recent report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the Great Barrier Reef, which downgraded the conservation outlook of the reef from “significant concern” to “critical”, the most serious in its four-tier rating system.He said the report was “just a rehash of old, mostly wrong or misleading information produced by generally untrustworthy scientific institutions with an activist agenda and no commitment to quality assurance”.Dr Ridd said it was normal for large areas of the reef to die and “the reef is fine”.“The coral always recovers vigorously after major mortality events,” he said. “Coral remains abundant on all 3000 reefs. The amount of coral, while fluctuating dramatically from year to year, is about the same today as when records began in the 1980s.”AAP FactCheck examined Dr Ridd’s statement that the current amount of coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef is similar to that found in the 1980s.Dr Ridd was a professor of marine physics at James Cook University before being dismissed in 2018 for breaching the university’s code of conduct after criticising colleagues’ research in a high-profile case which is still being fought in the courts.He has contributed to dozens of papers on marine science over the past 28 years, and has been critical about the quality of scientific research relating to the Great Barrier Reef (see examples here, here and here).This year he released a book, Reef Heresy? Science Research and the Great Barrier Reef. In an interview with Sky News, he said the book “demonstrates how the reef is not threatened by agriculture and various other things”.But is he right about the amount of coral cover on the reef?When contacted by AAP FactCheck, Dr Ridd said his claim was based on the Australian Institute of Marine Science’s (AIMS) annual survey of the Great Barrier Reef, which has been conducted every year since 1985.AIMS, a Commonwealth statutory authority, claims the survey is the most comprehensive available record on the reef’s condition.Its most recent monitoring report, from a survey conducted between September 2019 and June 2020, showed hard coral cover had fluctuated markedly since records began in 1985, but overall it had declined.Hard coral cover was “a simple and robust measure of reef health” as it was a “critical ecosystem engineer” in coral reef systems, the report said.Monitoring is divided into northern, central and southern regions of the reef – and all had lower cover in 2020 than in 1985, although there were significant fluctuations (see figures 3, 4 and 5 on pages 5, 6 and 7).Overall, the report said a range of impacts on the reef would lead to less coral cover in the future as climate change was predicted to negatively affect the growth and recovery of the reef. Its likely impacts included more frequent storms and bleaching events (page 9).“The prognosis of more frequent disturbances, each causing greater damage to reefs, combined with slower rates of recovery will inevitably lead to less living coral on the reefs of the GBR (Great Barrier Reef),” the report said.The authors noted that, due to the timing of the survey, it also did not capture the full impact of a severe 2020 mass bleaching event, when 25 per cent of reefs were reportedly severely bleached due to warm oceans.However, Dr Ridd provided figures which combined the three regions in the annual surveys to show the coral cover on the reef as a whole.These figures also showed large fluctuations – including significant growth between 2012 and 2016 – but also showed an overall decline in reef coverage. AAP FactCheck cross-referenced the figures with those from AIMS and found they were accurate.Comparing the figures from the first year of the survey, 1986, with the results from this year showed coral cover had declined from 25.9 per cent to 17.7 per cent.However, due to the significant annual variations in the figures, comparing two dates may be misleading. For example, average coral cover on the reef climbed to 24.1 per cent in 2016 – the highest reading since 1986 – before declining again.Dr Ridd said looking at decade-long averages of the figures was more accurate and this would show “we are about average at the moment”.AAP FactCheck averaged figures for 10 years of readings starting with 1986 and ending with 1995, and for 2011 to 2020. On average, coral cover across the entire reef was around five percentage points lower in the 2011-20 period than in 1986-95, declining from 21.6 per cent to 16.6 per cent – or a 23.2 per cent decrease.Applying a linear trend line to the figures to iron out annual fluctuations showed an overall decline in coral cover since the survey began (see chart).Average coral cover over the latest decade was also lower than during 2001-10, when it averaged 17.9 per cent, while the average for the entire 35-year reporting period was 19.2 per cent.Dr Ridd said the decline in averages was likely not statistically significant, but that “there may be a loss of coral on the GBR but not halving” as an earlier study suggested.He said comparing the past decade with the 1980s was also difficult due to the enormous loss of coral following Cyclone Hamish in 2009, which tracked along the reef.“Coral cover fluctuates massively,” Dr Ridd said. “If one was statistically ignorant, one could force almost any result one wants from the data. For example you could say the coral cover on the reef has increased by 50 per cent since 2011/12.”However, it could be argued that Dr Ridd made similar comparisons in his column when he argued that there had been essentially no change in reef cover since the 1980s.An AIMS spokesperson said because the survey involved a large number of reefs across the length of the barrier a detected change in cover of 10 percentage points or more was significant.“A difference of 10 per cent between the current coral cover and the baseline values of the 1980s means that a large proportion of reefs are required to follow this trend in order to influence the average coral cover values of GBR or each region,” the spokesperson said.AIMS Great Barrier Reef research programme director Britta Schaffelke said data summarising the coral of the whole reef could be misleading as it masked the impact of bleaching, storms and other pressures in the different sections of the reef.She said, when looking at the wide range of research, it was clear that the reef was under pressure and its health had declined over time.“Picking out 1985 and 2020 and saying there hasn’t been a large change is misleading, because in between there has been lots of changes … you need to look at the whole trajectory,” Dr Schaffelke said during a phone interview.“If you look at the detailed data, it does tell a tale of decline and as disturbances are becoming more frequent and more severe; the reef is not recovering to the same extent as it used to.”Dr Schaffelke said a small change in coral cover over the decades was significant.“If coral cover declines from 30 to 20 per cent, that’s a huge difference,” she said. “You can’t think about it as 100 per cent is the maximum and a 10 per cent difference is within the margin of error. Considering that most of the surveyed coral reefs currently have less than 30 per cent cover, if you lose 10 per cent that is losing more than a third.”Dr Schaffelke said the coral survey methodology was robust, but the best way to determine the health of the reef was not to look at surveys in isolation but in combination with the body of research on the reef.“There are thousands of journal publications over the last 10 years on aspects of the condition of the Great Barrier Reef. That whole body of research, together with the long-term monitoring, really tells the story that the reef is under pressure, and I think denying that is dangerous.”Last year, the government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority released its outlook report for the reef which provided a summary of evidence on the health of the reef from the last five years.A press release accompanying the report said the long-term outlook for the reef’s ecosystem had been downgraded from “poor” in 2014 to “very poor” in 2019.“While the outstanding universal value of the World Heritage Area remains whole and intact, its integrity is challenged and deteriorating,” it said.“Coral reefs overall have declined to very poor condition after extensive coral mortality from multiple impacts including back-to-back years of coral bleaching, cyclones and an ongoing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak.” The long-term outlook for the Great Barrier Reef has been downgraded to “very poor”.","https://www.theaustralian.com.au/exclusives/its-reef-science-thats-rotten-not-the-great-barrier/news-story/1d95f63bc1a2651f5f7c4f9837750513,https://worldheritageoutlook.iucn.org/explore-sites/wdpaid/2571#full-assessment,https://www.iucn.org/about,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/university-fires-controversial-marine-scientist-for-alleged-conduct-breaches,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-30/peter-ridd-donations-sacking-james-cook-university-high-court/12506230,https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7003771490,https://youtu.be/QbKa015q4cI?t=272,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/senate-inquiry-is-bringing-evidence-about-state-of-great-barrier-reef-to-the-surface/news-story/5e12533a9593e7fd93579cd9b68ee0aa,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/science/great-barrier-reef-coral-testing-flawed-needs-fix-says-peter-kidd/news-story/8c8432a1c8ee5ea13174356789cab310,https://www.connorcourtpublishing.com.au/REEF-HERESY-Science-Research-and-the-Great-Barrier-Reef--Peter-Ridd-_p_404.html,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6209861050001#:~:text=Marine%20scientist%20and%20physicist%20Professor,on%20the%20Great%20Barrier%20Reef.,https://www.aims.gov.au/docs/about/about.html,https://www.aims.gov.au/docs/research/monitoring/reef/latest-surveys.html,https://www.aims.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-08/AIMS_LTMP_AnnualSummaryReport_2019-20_Aug21_2020%282%29.pdf,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever#:~:text=The%20Great%20Barrier%20Reef%20has,temperatures%20driven%20by%20global%20heating.&text=The%202020%20bleaching%20was%20second,2016%20for%20severity%2C%20Hughes%20said.,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RM0JpwOMZIEmBNDzzOGpbarn6fPXFPhd5VJy9A7o_3A/edit#gid=0,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RM0JpwOMZIEmBNDzzOGpbarn6fPXFPhd5VJy9A7o_3A/edit#gid=0,https://www.pnas.org/content/109/44/17995,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-25/cyclone-hamish-reef-damage-worst-in-30-years/1629978,https://www.aims.gov.au/our-people/dr-britta-schaffelke,https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/handle/11017/3474,https://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/news-room/latest-news/latest-news/outlook-report/great-barrier-reef-outlook-report-cause-for-concern-and-accelerated-action",Has the Great Barrier Reef’s health barely changed since the 1980s?,,,,,,

And remember: no man who existed died. They turned into light and as such still exist. The secret is that these light particles return to original state. Return to one of the previous energies. Christ and some others knew this secret.“I was searching for how to preserve human energy. It is one of the forms of light. In the Soul sometimes equal to the supreme celestial light. I did not search for it for myself, but for the good of all. I believe that my discovery will make people’s lives easier and more bearable and direct them to spirituality and morality.”The purported quote features above a photo of Tesla as an old man.At the time of writing, the post had been viewed more than 89,000 times and generated more than 970 shares, 2600 reactions and 380 comments. The same quote has also been shared on other social media sites, including to an Australian Instagram account. A Facebook post attributes a quote about death to Serbian inventor Nicola Tesla. The AnalysisNikola Tesla is known for discovering rotating magnetic fields – the foundation for motors and electrical systems powered by alternating currents – and his pioneering work in wireless power distribution. Today, his name is honoured in Elon Musk’s electric car marque.However, while the Serbian scientist’s thinking did at times veer towards the philosophical, experts say the quote did not come from the famed inventor. Instead, the words appear to stem from a 1995 fictional play about Tesla’s life and views which was later adapted into a radio series and film.Tesla was born in 1856 to Serbian parents in the Croatian village of Smiljan. He conceptualised alternating currents while studying at the University of Graz in Austria, but it was in Paris in 1882 when he built his first induction motor.After emigrating to the US in 1884, Tesla initially worked for Thomas Edison but left to continue his work inventing and patenting electrical technology. Many of his inventions, such as the Tesla coil used in wireless devices and networks, are still used today. He died on January 7, 1943 from heart failure.The Belgrave-based Nikola Tesla Museum, which holds the inventor’s ashes, possesses original documents and artefacts belonging to Tesla as well as archives of his writings and lectures.A museum spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that “there is no certain record or any original source that (the purported quote) was Tesla’s sentence”.Ellis Oswalt, an actor and dramatist from New York, whose book Tesla’s Words: A Stunning Utopia of the Future was awarded the Tesla Spirit Medal by the Tesla Science Foundation, told AAP FactCheck the post “doesn’t look like a genuine Tesla quote … and having read all of his existing interviews and lectures, I don’t think this is a legitimate quote”.“Tesla had a grandiose spiritual side for sure, but he was a lot more rational than a lot of his contemporary new-age fans can understand. In his autobiography, at the age of 63, he wrote a section rebuking the belief in ghosts, divination, and the supernatural belief in ‘spirits’,” Mr Oswalt said in an email.The quote also does not appear in an archive of Tesla’s quotes on Tesla Universe, a website dedicated to the inventor’s life and contributions to the fields of electricity, radio and robotics.Parts of the quote do, however, appear in a 2001 film, Tesla or the Adaptation of an Angel (Tesla ili prilagodjavanje andjela), which featured a fictional interview between the inventor and a journalist from a non-existent US magazine named Immortality.The film was adapted from Stevan Pešić’s 1995 play by the same name. The work is set in Colorado Springs in 1899 and explores the inventor’s “sacrifices and tamed visions”, according to director Dušan Mihailović, who has staged the play.A transcript shows parts of the quote and, while the wording is not identical, the meaning is consistent with the sentiment of the post. The lines corresponding to the quote are highlighted in bold:JOURNALIST: You said that I am, like every being, the Light. This flatters me, but I confess, I do not quite understand.TESLA: Why would you need to understand, Mr. Smith? Suffice it to believe it. Everything is light. In one its ray is the fate of nations, each nation has its own ray in what great light source we see as the sun. And remember: no one who was there did not die. They transformed into the light, and as such exist still. The secret lies in the fact that the light particles restore their original state.JOURNALIST: This is the resurrection!TESLA: I prefer to call it: return to a previous energy. Christ and several others knew the secret. I am searching how to preserve human energy. It is forms of Light, sometimes straight like heavenly light. I have not looked for it for my own sake, but for the good of all. I believe that my discoveries make people’s lives easier and more bearable, and channel them to spirituality and morality.According to an archive of defunct US magazines, there has never been a published periodical named Immortality. A statue of the famous Serbian inventor and scientist Nikola Tesla in Belgrade, Serbia.","https://archive.vn/RxRIl,https://archive.vn/HRbxK,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikola-Tesla,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/technology/nikola-tesla.html,https://www.fi.edu/case-files/nikola-tesla,https://www.biography.com/inventor/nikola-tesla,https://teslasciencecenter.org/teslas-wireless-power/,https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/,https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/images/ashes-nikola-tesla-nikola-tesla-museum-belgrade-serbia,https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/writings/,https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/lectures/,http://teslaswords.com/new-page-3,http://teslaswords.com/#teslas-words-section,http://teslasciencefoundation.org/about-us/,https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/308224/my-inventions-and-other-writings-by-nikola-tesla/,https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/quotes?author_id=11324&sort_by=random_seed&sort_order=ASC,https://teslauniverse.com/about,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288842/,https://youtu.be/rL_5JLkzV_4?t=3290,https://wepa.unima.org/en/stevan-pesic/,https://www.narodnopozoriste.rs/en/performances/tesla-or-the-adaptation-of-an-angel,https://www.facebook.com/notes/tesla-tube/tesla-the-accomodation-of-angels/507861429271865/,http://www.gutenberg.us/articles/Category:Defunct_magazines_of_the_United_States",Nikola Tesla’s ‘death and light’ quote dims under closer scrutiny,,,,,,

Her only word was ‘I am so sick of these n*****s, so I made my own vows to myself Person with veil. Ayuol took the decision to marry herself after she had enough of men lying,” the Facebook post reads.Alongside the post is a picture of a woman wearing a bridal gown standing in a church hall.The woman’s purported story has been featured in a number of online sources (see examples here and here) including on South Sudanese “urban news” outlet Hot In Juba, on the website for a South African radio station and a Malaysian page.At the time of writing, the December 2 post had been shared more than 200 times and received 300 reactions and more than 150 comments. A Facebook post claims a woman in Australia “married herself” because she was sick of men. The AnalysisThe Facebook post’s claim is based on a tweet posted by South Sudanese model Ayuol Manyok, who lives in Australia. The tweet includes the image of Ms Manyok in a bridal gown that was featured in the Facebook post, as well as the caption “sick of these n****s, so I made my own vows to myself”.However, the post was not intended to be taken literally.“Girl, this is a bridal photo shoot I did, the caption is supposed to be witty,” the model wrote on Twitter in a follow-up post.The Hot in Juba article cited “sources close to Ayoul” as saying that she made the decision after she “had enough of men lying, breaking her heart and stuff”.However, when AAP FactCheck contacted Ms Manyok regarding her tweet she confirmed that it was a joke and “isn’t that deep”.“I’m a model and fortunately model beautiful clothing.

Sometimes referred to as “solygamy” it is not legally recognised in Australia but is viewed by some as a symbolic opportunity to express “self-love”.A Gold Coast woman made headlines for a “self-marriage” in 2017 as did an Italian woman in the same year. In 2015, a US woman invited friends to her 40th birthday and turned it into a surprise wedding by walking down the aisle by herself. The act of marrying oneself is sometimes called “solygamy” or self-marriage.","https://archive.is/N7IGu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6en4KRZjI,https://www.ghpage.com/sudanese-woman-marries-herself-explains-ordeal-men/173406/,https://hotinjuba.com/south-sudanese-woman-marries-herself-claims-she-is-sick-of-men/,https://www.ecr.co.za/shows/stacey-jsbu/tired-men-well-you-are-not-alone-woman-married-herself/,https://www.mstar.com.my/global/dunia/2020/12/05/wanita-kahwini-diri-sendiri-akui-meluat-dengan-perangai-lelaki,https://archive.is/I6qmQ,https://twitter.com/AyuolManyok/status/1335421723206795264?s=20,https://archive.vn/6i3kK,http://www.chadwickmodels.com/portfolios/ayuol-manyok,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/marry-herself-marriage-wedding-linda-doktar-self-sologamy-australia-a8470016.html,https://www.abc.net.au/life/why-women-marry-themselves/11733546,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41413297,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/woman-marries-reason/story?id=28575144",Did a South Sudanese model ‘marry herself’ in Australia?,,,,,,
51,,,,False,,2020-12-14,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/move-over-atlantis-is-australia-geographys-greatest-fiction/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementIt may not be the lost city of Atlantis, but a social media post questions whether another island – Australia – is also the product of fiction.The Facebook post from June 3, shared to a group in which users debate flat Earth theories, features an aerial image of Australia with a red “FAKE” stamped over the picture. The text underneath reads: “Australia isn’t real. The people are either paid actors or robots.”It goes on to claim, “It’s a hoax, made for us to believe that Britain moved over their criminals to someplace. In reality, all these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters, drowning before they could see land ever again.”The post continues by claiming that “plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all actuality only flown you to islands close nearby – or in some cases, parts of South America, where they have cleared space and hired actors to act out as real Australians”.The post by a user whose profile states they live in the Netherlands had attracted more than 670 comments, 100 reactions and 60 shares at the time of writing. There is also a Facebook group dedicated to the theme. A Facebook post claims that Australia “isn’t real” and its people are actors or robots. The AnalysisWhile Australia’s dazzling array of bizarre and often deadly native fauna may stretch plausibility, the island nation’s many unique features offer proof enough to quell the most ardent conspiracists’ claims.The suggestion that Australia is a hoax – accompanying by text closely matching that in the Facebook post – dates back to at least 2017 after reportedly first surfacing on Reddit.Australia is a member of international bodies such as the OECD and the World Trade Organization, and is a founding member of the United Nations. It can be viewed from space on Google Earth using satellite imagery from a range of sources.It is also the world’s largest island and smallest continent (page 17) and boasts its own tectonic plate, the Australian Plate.Although the country’s European history dates back only to the early 17th century, Indigenous people are believed to have inhabited the land for tens of thousands of years.In 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first European to make a recorded landing in Australia. He went on to map parts of Australia, calling the continent “New Holland”.But it was Captain James Cook who in 1770 sailed to the eastern coast of Australia and claimed the territory for the British Crown. Eighteen years later, on January 26, 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip sailed into Botany Bay along with 11 ships to establish a convict settlement.Journal records of the trip written by crew and passengers provide evidence of life on the ships, including discipline, injuries and deaths. A catalogue listing the names of the 1500 men, women and children convicts – some as young as 13 – on the First Fleet can be searched via a State Library of Queensland database.The discovery and dating of ancient Aboriginal rock art has helped scientists understand Australia’s indigenous history. The oldest example dates back to around 30,000 years ago, but Dr Bruno David, an anthropological archaeologist from Monash University, told the National Museum of Australia that radiocarbon dating on tools suggested some artwork could be nearly 50,000 years old.Indigenous people are thought to have been in Australia for at least 65,000 years. The earliest geological evidence of inhabitation has been found at Madjedbebe, an Aboriginal rock shelter in the Northern Territory, according to Dr Michael Westaway, a biological anthropologist at the University of Queensland.Dr Westaway told AAP FactCheck in an email that DNA evidence showed Aboriginal people and Papuans split from their ancestral Eurasian brethren 58,000 years ago as the groups travelled south, forming distinct populations.“Using large-scale genome data from Australians and Papuans, we estimate the time of divergence between the Papuans and Australians to be around 37,000 years ago,” he said.Aboriginal people carry certain genetic traits which are unique to their population, according to Dr Sally Wasef, a paleontologist with expertise in ancient DNA retrieval and analysis.She told AAP FactCheck during a phone interview that mitochondrial DNA – transmitted through maternal family lines – from Aboriginal people contained groups of DNA that “do not exist anywhere outside of Australia”.Dr Wasef said the genetic markers of Australia’s first peoples had evolved over time and developed into a new haplotype, a set of DNA variations that never left the continent. Contrary to the post’s claim that visitors to Australia were really in South America, Dr Wasef said the genome of Aboriginal people most closely resembled that of their near-neighbours the Papuans – rather than indigenous South Americans.“Indigenous Australians and South Americans are two completely different populations, and genomic-wise, you can separate them clearly from each other,” she said.Australia is also a nation with a rich array of distinct flora and fauna. Around 86 per cent of plant species, 87 per cent of mammals and 93 per cent of reptiles are endemic to the continent, according to a report for the Australian Biological Resources Study.“These animals and plants have evolved independently in isolation from the rest of the world. We’ve had many independent radiations in floral and faunal groups within Australia into our diverse climates and habitats,” Professor Ary Hoffman, the Chair of Ecological Genetics at the University of Melbourne told AAP FactCheck in an email.Among the animals found only in Australia is the platypus. The duck-billed, egg-laying aquatic mammal, featured on Australia’s 20 cent coin, inhabits rivers, streams and freshwater lakes in the eastern states.Along with the various types of echidnas, platypuses are one of five species in the world in the order of monotremes, which are egg-laying mammals. Monotremes are only found in the Australia-Papua New Guinea region.Dr Lisa Godinho, a senior bioscience lecturer at the University of Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck monotremes shared a common ancestor from around 160 million years ago when the Gondwana super-continent, which included modern-day Africa, Antarctica, Australia and South America, split away from the ancient supercontinent Pangea.“Monotremes didn’t arise in Australia, but the recognisable platypus and the echidna did and they evolved in an isolated continent, which is why we have such high numbers of endemic species,” Dr Godinho said via email.Australia is also home to the oldest-discovered geological material on the planet, distinguishing the continent from other land masses.Dr David Murphy, a geologist from the Queensland University of Technology, said zircons found inside quartzite rock formations in Western Australia’s Jack Hills could be dated to over four billion years old.“The zircons from this rock contain the oldest material preserved on the Earth and the only information we have about the Earth’s first 500 million years,” Dr Murphy told AAP FactCheck in an email.“There are a few other places in the world with a very small number of four billion-year-old zircons, but nowhere has the abundance of Jack Hills or zircons that are as old.”NASA described the Jack Hills zircons “the oldest pieces of Earth material ever found“, most likely formed in the presence of abundant water – indicating the planet was cooler and wetter in its early existence than theories previously suggested.Another geological phenomenon unique to Australia is the preservation of ancient flora and fauna in deposits of the country’s national gem, the opal. Australia is the only region in which opalised fossils have been found.A spokeswoman for Geoscience Australia told AAP FactCheck that Australian opal formations were distinct from those found in countries like Ethopia, Mexico and Indonesia, where opals were located in volcanic rocks.“Australia hosts the world’s only known precious opal deposits in sedimentary rocks. And fossils are almost exclusively found in sedimentary rocks,” she said in an email.Australia’s most famous opalised fossil, Eric the Pliosaur, was discovered in Coober Pedy in 1987 and remains “one of the most complete opalised vertebrates known”, according to an article from the Australian Museum. Uluru is located in the centre of Australia – not South America as the Facebook post would suggest.","https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/atlantis/,https://archive.vn/l8Iq0,https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/flat-earthers-what-they-believe-and-why/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1934898313212788/,https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/conspiracy-theory-australia-doesnt-exist#.nf1QD2O4d,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/apr/15/australia-doesnt-exist-and-other-bizarre-geographic-conspiracies-that-wont-go-away,https://www.oecd.org/australia/,https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/australia_e.htm,http://data.un.org/en/iso/au.html,https://earth.google.com/web/@-27.28575944,138.38661394,-372.54534779a,26254311.28053188d,35y,3.92601707h,0t,0r,https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p194981/pdf/book.pdf,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/janssen-willem-2270,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/janszoon-maps-northern-australian-coast,http://www.duyfken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/route-of-the-Duyfken1.pdf,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/cook-claims-australia,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/cook-claims-australia,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/convict-cargo,https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/terra-australis-australia/journals-first-fleet,https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2054800,https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/first-fleet-ships/john-hudson,https://convictrecords.com.au/,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/first-rock-art,https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bruno-david,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/evidence-of-first-peoples,https://www.britannica.com/place/Madjedbebe,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/24187,https://experts.griffith.edu.au/9367-sally-wasef,https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondrial-DNA,https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/haplotype,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/2ee3f4a1-f130-465b-9c7a-79373680a067/files/nlsaw-2nd-complete.pdf,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/17129-ary-hoffmann,https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/40488/21964009,https://australian.museum/learn/animals/mammals/platypus/,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/19876-lisa-godinho,https://australian.museum/learn/dinosaurs/mesozoic-era/,https://www.britannica.com/place/Pangea,https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/david.murphy,https://www.ga.gov.au/education/classroom-resources/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/zircon,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/6331/western-australias-jack-hills,https://www.ga.gov.au/education/classroom-resources/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/opal,https://www.ga.gov.au/education/classroom-resources/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/opal,https://australian.museum/learn/australia-over-time/extinct-animals/omoonasaurus-demoscyllus/,https://australian.museum/learn/australia-over-time/extinct-animals/omoonasaurus-demoscyllus/",Move over Atlantis – is Australia geography’s greatest fiction?,,,,,,

GreenMedInfo has been described as a website that frequently repeats false health claims by NewsGuard.The Jerusalem Post article remains live with updated copy. It includes additional quotes from Dr Uri Lerner, the scientific director for Israeli non-profit health organisation Midaat, saying of the trial deaths, “According to the published data, six of the participants in the experiment died, two of whom received the vaccine and four of the control group. After an in-depth examination, no connection was found between the experiment and the cause of death.”The older version of the GreenMedInfo article linked to a briefing document from the US Food and Drug Administration about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trial.Under the heading “Serious Adverse Events” (page 41), the FDA document states that a total of six people from the 43,448 enrolled participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine trials died during the reporting period – which covered the period from April 29 to November 14.Two of those six were receiving the vaccine, while four were in the control group receiving a placebo. Both vaccine recipients were older than 55. One had a cardiac arrest 62 days after their second vaccination and died three days later. The other died from arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, three days after their first vaccination dose.The report concludes of both the vaccine and control group deaths, “All deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate.”In a separate briefing document for the same advisory committee on December 10, the FDA says that “none of these deaths were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention” (page 50), a reference to their participation in the vaccine trial.Regarding the vaccine trial, Pfizer told AAP FactCheck in a statement: “In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent Data Monitoring Committee.”Several other posts from Australia-managed Facebook pages include links to articles reporting the trial deaths or their headlines to suggest people should be wary of the vaccine (see here, here and here).Evans has frequently posted false and misleading information about the COVID-19 pandemic (see here, here, here and here). The FDA has been assessing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for safety.","https://archive.vn/wKuUG,https://peteevans.com/about/,https://archive.vn/XyNHq,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-55234460,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/coronavirus-anti-vaxxers-seek-to-discredit-pfizers-vaccine,https://archive.vn/XyNHq,https://web.archive.org/web/20201208142015/www.jpost.com/breaking-news/two-individuals-die-from-pfizer-vaccine-651488,https://archive.vn/10aKT,https://www.newsguardtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GreenMedInfo.pdf,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/two-individuals-die-from-pfizer-vaccine-651488,https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569,https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download,https://www.facebook.com/1408054936141523/posts/2824123257868010,https://www.facebook.com/1594559574167102/posts/2973212059635173,https://www.facebook.com/230670968385516/posts/333762701409675,https://www.aap.com.au/claim-of-no-covid-19-pandemic-ignores-basic-facts/,https://www.aap.com.au/death-rate-figures-for-covid-19-dont-add-up/,https://www.aap.com.au/glaxosmithkline-falsely-linked-to-wuhan-lab-pfizer-in-covid-19-contrivance/,https://www.aap.com.au/victoria-did-not-take-an-imf-bribe-in-return-for-lockdown/",Reports spread misinformation on Pfizer vaccine trial deaths,,,,,,

Who, by chance, owns Pfizer (the one who produces the vaccine!),” the post reads.It claims Pfizer is “managed by Black Rock (sic) finances. Who, by chance, manages the finances of the Open Foundation Company (SOROS FOUNDATION)!”The post also links investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard Group to the two billionaires, claiming Vanguard is a “shareholder of Black Rock … which, incidentally, is a major shareholder of MICROSOFT The property of BILL GATES, who happens to be a shareholder of PFIZER (which sells the miracle vaccine) and is currently the first sponsor of WHO !!!”At the time of writing, the post had been shared by more than 630 times and attracted more than 21,000 views and 200 reactions. The same text has been posted by several other Facebook accounts, including in Australia by former TV chef Pete Evans, as well as here and here. A post claims links between COVID-19 vaccine research companies and George Soros and Bill Gates. The AnalysisWhile the post suggests a web of links between pharmaceutical giants involved in COVID-19 vaccine development, investment firms and billionaires Bill Gates and George Soros, the purported conspiracy falls down at the first hurdle.The post’s claim the “Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan” is owned by GlaxoSmithKlein (GSK) is not true, nor does the British pharmaceutical firm own US rival Pfizer.The Wuhan Institute of Virology was the focus of conspiracy theories early in the pandemic, when it was suggested without evidence that COVID-19 was man-made and had escaped the laboratory.The institute, which studies emerging and major viral diseases, falls under the umbrella and control of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), according to its website. The CAS is in turn controlled by China’s State Council, the country’s main administrative government body.The CAS has historically received half of its income directly from the Chinese government, while the remainder came from competitive funding or technology transfer, according to a 2019 letter from a CAS representative to the science journal Nature.GSK’s website states that it only operates two facilities in China – a pharmaceuticals business and a consumer healthcare business, both based in Shanghai.GSK and Pfizer have been involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer’s partnership with German firm BioNTech produced the first publicly administered COVID-19 vaccine in the Western world following its regulatory approval in the UK.The two firms are publicly traded companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange – however the claim that Pfizer is owned by GSK is incorrect. Pfizer was nearly 69 per cent owned by institutional shareholders such as investment firms as of 10 December.The pharma companies did, however, announce a joint venture in August 2019 to create the world’s largest over-the-counter drugs business. Pfizer said the combined business will operate under the name GSK Consumer Healthcare and that Pfizer would own a 32 per cent stake in the joint venture and GSK 68 per cent.As one of Pfizer’s largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock owns 414,768,435 shares in the company, equating to around 10.8 per cent of total shares. However, BlackRock isn’t Pfizer’s largest shareholder, with the title belonging to the Vanguard Group, which owns around 11.7 per cent of the pharma firm.Vanguard is also the largest institutional shareholder in Microsoft, the company co-founded by tech billionaire Bill Gates, with BlackRock again second in the list.However, Microsoft is not the “property” of Mr Gates, as claimed, who only owned around 1.3 per cent of its shares before he stepped down from the company’s board in March. In 2014 he was surpassed by former CEO Steve Ballmer as the software company’s largest individual shareholder.The post also claims BlackRock manages the finances of George Soros’ “Open Foundation Company” (sic). AAP FactCheck found no evidence to link Soros’ philanthropic organisation, the Open Society Foundation, to BlackRock on the outfits’ websites.However, George Soros’s investment company, Soros Fund Management, previously held a small number of shares in BlackRock before offloading them in March 2020.After US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the World Health Organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation became the largest voluntary contributor to the body.The foundation has also invested in Pfizer to expand access to the pharmaceutical company’s injectable contraceptive, which it says would give women in developing countries an affordable birth-control option. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) does not own China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology as claimed.","https://archive.vn/TkAYD,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,https://archive.is/qG5YW,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2782640328675469&set=a.2235358340070340&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/cosmos67/posts/10213992270681214,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,http://english.whiov.cas.cn/About_Us2016/Brief_Introduction2016/,http://english.www.gov.cn/state_council/2014/09/03/content_281474985533579.htm,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03205-z,https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/medicago-and-gsk-announce-start-of-phase-23-clinical-trials-of-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/,https://biontech.de/covid-19,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://archive.vn/hfKDC,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_announces_closing_of_joint_venture_with_glaxosmithkline_to_create_a_premier_global_consumer_healthcare_company#:~:text=As%20previously%20announced%2C%20under%20the,led%20by%20CEO%20Brian%20McNamara,https://archive.vn/hfKDC,https://archive.vn/q288K,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/technology/bill-gates-microsoft-board.html,https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/2/5676328/steve-ballmer-passes-bill-gates-microsoft-largest-shareholder,https://www.google.com/search?ei=juvSX-2hLJaG4-EPqtu-kAY&q=%22blackrock%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensocietyfoundations.org&oq=%22blackrock%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensocietyfoundations.org&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoRCAAQsAMQigMQtwMQ5QIQiwM6HQguEMcBEK8BELADEIoDELcDEOUCEIsDEKYDEKgDUIEoWOguYNAwaAFwAHgBgAH8AYgBpQqSAQUwLjguMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQq4AQLAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjtoMqWgsXtAhUWwzgGHaqtD2IQ4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22open+society+foundation%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackrock.com&oq=%22open+society+foundation%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackrock.com&aqs=chrome..69i57.8616j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/8754Z@US:US,https://fintel.io/so/us/blk/soros-fund-management-llc,https://www.state.gov/update-on-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/,https://open.who.int/2018-19/contributors/contributor,https://sif.gatesfoundation.org/investments/pfizer/","GlaxoSmithKline falsely linked to Wuhan lab, Pfizer in COVID-19 contrivance",,,,,,

One BBC screenshot is dated December 8, while another CNN article dated October 22 carries a similar image.“Please explain to me how the same person who’s the “first to get vaccinated” today in a BBC article…..90 year old Margaret Kennan (sic)….is also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October?” the post’s caption states.“The establishment fake news gets more absurd each day.”At the time of writing, the Facebook post from a user listed as living in Melbourne, Victoria, had been viewed more than 15,000 times and shared more than 270 times. Similar claims have also been circulating on Instagram and Twitter. A Facebook post features screenshots of reports about the UK’s first COVID-19 vaccine recipient. The AnalysisWhile internet sleuths claim to have uncovered a hoax involving the UK’s first COVID-19 vaccine recipient, their “fake news” suggestions misunderstand how the image has been attached to online reports.Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced on November 18 that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate had successfully passed efficacy tests, proving 95 per cent effective in combating the virus.The UK government accepted regulatory approval for the vaccine on December 2 and announced the jabs would be rolled out from the week starting December 7 with elderly people given priority. It was the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use.Nonagenarian Margaret Keenan was the first in line to receive the vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry – and imagery of her being administered the shot was used worldwide. That included by news organisations featured in screenshots in the Facebook post: the BBC, KTNV 13 Action News and 8 News NOW.On December 10, a video package including footage of Ms Keenan receiving the injection was also among the videos that appeared on an October 22 CNN article. The article was about a report finding the Trump administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially led to 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths.The article is not related to the UK’s rollout of the Pfizer vaccine and includes no images of Ms Keenan in its main body. Rather, the video is part of a ‘carousel’ of video packages on related topics that feature on the CNN website. The unique URL for the video indicates it was posted on December 8. Other videos that appeared on the same October 22 article, as of December 10, included an interview with US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar from December 9 and a report from the same date on social media sites tackling vaccine misinformation.An archived version of the same article, from October 22, does not feature the video including Ms Keenan and instead lists videos from the previous several days (see examples here and here).A widely used photograph of Ms Keenan with her sleeve rolled up receiving the injection was taken by Jacob King for the Associated Press on December 8. A reverse image search of the same photo shows the earliest iteration of it online was posted on the same date and not October.A similar claim about Ms Keenan’s image purportedly being used in October has been debunked here. Margaret Keenan receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine dose under the UK’s inoculation program.","https://archive.vn/Ouiu4,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIkEV5_APge/,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-2-december-2020/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-2-december-2020#vaccine-priority-groups-advice-on-2-december-2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/02/uk/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-uk-intl-hnk/index.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55227325,https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/coronavirus/90-year-old-woman-in-england-is-the-first-to-receive-initial-dose-of-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.8newsnow.com/news/international/turning-point-uk-giving-1st-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine/,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/12/08/uk-first-coronavirus-vaccination-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/coronavirus-intl/,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/22/health/covid-response-deaths-columbia-report/index.html,https://archive.vn/vofiZ,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/12/09/alex-azar-hhs-vaccine-distribution-newday-camerota-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/coronavirus/,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/12/09/anti-vaccination-misinformation-social-media-nr-vpx.cnn,https://web.archive.org/web/20201030133606/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/22/health/covid-response-deaths-columbia-report/index.html,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/10/27/trump-covid-19-election-jim-acosta-tsr-vpx.cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/10/27/sanjay-gupta-coronavirus-us-exponential-growth-warning-sot-cpt-vpx.cnn,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/APTOPIX-Virus-Outbreak-Britain/cc6b791427294d38834c226bd993e76c/53/0,https://tineye.com/search/a6ed3455815d8d502b9ad95f74ef69eb4dea0842?sort=crawl_date&order=asc&page=1,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/09/facebook-posts/conspiracy-theory-targets-first-recipient-uk-covid/","No, this COVID-19 vaccine photo isn’t ‘fake news’ from October",,,,,,
55,,,,False,,2020-12-08,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/false-bill-gates-depopulate-with-vaccines-news-a-conspiracy-theory-classic/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post suggests that a 2011 newspaper article highlighting Bill Gates’s plan to depopulate the Earth through forced vaccination has been effectively scrubbed from the public record.The post includes a screenshot of what appears to be an Instagram post that features a woman holding a copy of a newspaper titled the “Sovereign Independent”.Text above the image in the screenshot says, “2011….this article can’t be found anywhere now !!! This amazing lady kept it all these years. Share the arse out of this.”The front-page story includes the headline: “Depopulation through forced vaccination: The Zero Carbon Solution”. Beside the headline is an image of Mr Gates and a blurry quote in which he says new vaccines, health care and reproductive services may reduce population growth.At the time of writing, the November 27 post had been shared more than 250 times and received more than 30 reactions. It was posted by a user who listed their location as Bendigo, Victoria.A reverse image search reveals the image has been shared widely online, with more than 400 results for similar images returned. A social media post claims a Sovereign Independent article has been scrubbed from public view. The AnalysisContrary to the claim in the post, the newspaper article is readily available online. It repeats a quote from Bill Gates that has repeatedly been used out of context to perpetuate conspiracy theories surrounding the Microsoft founder and his vaccine advocacy.A Google search returns multiple links to copies of the Sovereign Independent’s fourth edition from 2011 in the first page of results (including here, here and here).The Sovereign Independent was an Ireland-based newspaper which published conspiracy theories and other misinformation around topics such as vaccines.Other articles in the edition shown in the Facebook post claim the US killing of Osama Bin Laden was a hoax (page 5) and that vaccines cause autism “within weeks” (page 11).Another edition includes stories claiming Freemasons were devil-worshippers in cahoots with the UN to control the world (page 10) and that television is a form of brainwashing controlled by the government to implement “the New World Order” (page 12).The newspaper began publishing in 2009, according to a digital copy of its first edition, and appears to have only run seven copies, based on archives published by Dave Derby, who is identified in interviews as the paper’s editor. Its listed website is no longer active, although archived versions remain online.The front-page story shown in the Facebook post claimed vaccines didn’t prevent illness and were designed to ensure people got sick to enrich pharmaceutical companies and to reduce the number of people on the pension.It said vaccines were also part of a depopulation agenda promoted by the United Nations and Mr Gates.As evidence for this, it included a quote from a TED Talk Mr Gates gave in 2010, titled Innovating to Zero, in which he discussed ways the world could reduce carbon emissions. One way was by reducing population growth through improving healthcare.“The world today has 6.8 billion people,” Mr Gates said in the talk. “That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now if we do a great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 per cent.”On the front page of the newspaper this quote was attributed to “Billy ‘The Kid Killer’ Gates”.The article seized on the quote before adding “the globalist elite care nothing for humanity; ordinary men, women and children must be eliminated in their delusional minds to ensure that their superior types go into the future with the best of breeding being the only criteria worthy of saving”.However, Mr Gates has stated multiple times that he believed population growth could, counterintuitively, be slowed by improving healthcare and reducing child mortality – not through killing children or adults. These improvements could be in part achieved through increasing access to vaccinations. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged billions of dollars towards the cause.In a 2011 article in Forbes magazine, Mr Gates identified that countries with lower child mortality rates typically had lower birth rates, and so improving healthcare and vaccination rates could reduce the world’s population.He said this was because parents could be confident their children would survive to adulthood and therefore they did not need large families.He reiterated this view in a 2018 video published on his YouTube channel in which he says, “We find that in every country in the world this is repeated – the population growth goes down as we improve health.”He made the same point in a 2012 video, and in posts on his website here and here.The quote from the 2010 TED Talk has repeatedly been taken out of context to suggest Mr Gates wants to reduce the world population by killing or sterilising people through vaccinations (for example here and here).Similar misinformation involving the same quote has previously been fact-checked as false (see here, here and here).Mr Gates has also repeatedly been the target of numerous misleading and false claims on social media. AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims that he has been charged with war crimes and wants to microchip humans, among others (see here, here and here). Microsoft founder Bill Gates says lower child-mortality rates can lead to lower population growth.","https://archive.vn/NgCAs,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-NZ&tbs=sbi:AMhZZiv7_1JaiBDtq2YEazye3lXC5JrhYNrcRdEB3E_1NgIkVxzpZunZpRAVhKQksSVJCign6jnbwvpanMLass2cKUxSWvVSbygt-_1cdFK6wrYXdrKiH08Zp8MNtyruBxOQ9KcpMcBtDnnMZXa2CY05_1gTCULt1TFrOMPRQHvtxzT9wE7RN8EgRuTEkrpM-JtvGAS7U-5q5k0IBc4bi2kwGee-XK2mhAcOYDNZMQE8V2iqVAHDTt1izhPnvWKnAyz-3Z_1W_1K7njq_1-3n-LAB2j-0a87N-yigYMsd1SXTfgs7r_1rBP7hXXoZq0ZnR423Ajfn0MiHAnED1_1H&sxsrf=ALeKk03XSQ29chynF6J0vZi7uwUn0Csaxg:1606882837956&ei=FRbHX_30ObyZ4-EP_8urwAg&start=20&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwi904GGua7tAhW8zDgGHf_lCog4ChDy0wN6BAgVEDk&biw=652&bih=742&dpr=2,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02FKMCVexNsAhKx1q399eU-XlJE4w%3A1606881830428&ei=JhLHX9TZGeub4-EPxdKS6AU&q=%22Sovereign+Independent%22+4th+edition&oq=%22Sovereign+Independent%22+4th+edition&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DA4gRY1v4EYJOBBWgAcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjUhMulta7tAhXrzTgGHUWpBF0Q4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://www.docdroid.net/aoZfG1E/the-sovereign-independent-june-2011-4th-edition-pdf#page=2,https://issuu.com/sovindo/docs/sovindo4,https://ia803204.us.archive.org/11/items/sovereign-independent-issue-4/Sovereign_Independent_Issue4.pdf,https://www.docdroid.net/aoZfG1E/the-sovereign-independent-june-2011-4th-edition-pdf,https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/51524937/download-the-sovereign-independent-issue-6,https://issuu.com/sovindo/docs/papers,https://issuu.com/sovindo,https://www.mixcloud.com/Tir_na_Saor/special-broadcast-sovereignty-sealed-and-the-infiltration-of-the-irish-truth-movement,http://sovereignindependent.org/,https://web.archive.org/web/20140311024746/http://www.sovereignindependent.org/,https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_innovating_to_zero/transcript?language=en,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/01/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Pledge-$10-Billion-in-Call-for-Decade-of-Vaccines,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/02/the-second-coming-of-bill-gates/?sh=aff3f6913fd5,https://youtu.be/obRG-2jurz0?list=PLRzLQX23nc4iJiaN1g-yvePjMZmRMQ9_M&t=66,https://www.gatesnotes.com/about-bill-gates/a-conversation-with-bill-gates-population-growth,https://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-annual-letter?WT.mc_id=01_21_2015_DO_GFO_domain_0_00&page=1&lang=en,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepersreport2017/case-studies/child-mortality/,https://www.naturalnews.com/029911_vaccines_Bill_Gates.html,http://archive.is/fqvuk,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-vaccinations-depopulation/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/may/03/blog-posting/no-bill-gates-did-not-outline-2018-plan-depopulate/,http://www.mythdetector.ge/en/myth/does-bill-gates-promise-us-depopulation-and-chipping,https://www.aap.com.au/gates-fauci-who-and-cdc-havent-been-charged-with-war-crimes/,https://www.aap.com.au/no-bill-gates-isnt-partnering-with-id-companies-to-implant-microchips-in-humans/,https://www.aap.com.au/bill-gates-wasnt-in-new-zealand-this-year-and-those-microchip-claims-have-already-been-debunked/,https://www.aap.com.au/conspiracy-insta-post-misrepresents-gates-interview-in-false-claims/,https://www.aap.com.au/bill-gates-didnt-say-only-the-vaccinated-would-be-free-to-move/",False Bill Gates ‘depopulate with vaccines’ news a conspiracy theory classic,,,,,,

In so many ways,” the post warns.At the time of publication, the November 27 post had been shared more than 320 times and generated more than 150 reactions and 16,000 views. A post claims a firm was raided to seize evidence of the role they played in the “US election fraud” The AnalysisAs President Donald Trump continues to denounce the US election result and pursue court action to overturn Joe Biden’s victory, conspiracy theories over the voting process and voting machines have mounted.The Facebook post’s purported raid on election technology company Scytl is among them.The false claims about Scytl appear to have originated from comments made on November 12 by Republican member of Congress Louie Gohmert in an interview with conservative TV station Newsmax (video mark 4min 30sec) that the US army had seized “the Scytl server”.Mr Gohmert’s claim was cited in an article by GreatGameIndia on November 14, along with the suggestion that “US Military raided voting machine company Scytl servers in Germany for evidence of manipulation in US 2020 elections after it was exposed in vote switching scandal”.The article cited intelligence sources and included Mr Gohmert’s comments from a Facebook video conference call, in which he said that Scytl was headquartered in Frankfurt.“I don’t know the truth,” Mr Gohmert said (video mark 1min 37sec). “I know that there was a German tweet in German saying that on Monday, US Army forces went into Scytl and grabbed their server.”However, there is no credible evidence to support the story. A US Army spokesman told Associated Press the allegations that the army engaged in an operation to recover servers in Germany were false.Meanwhile, Scytl said in a statement that it did not provide electronic voting machines to any US jurisdictions, nor was it involved in vote counting or tabulation. It added that it has no offices in Frankfurt and it had last used servers in the city for a 2019 project for the European parliament. The company’s website lists its only European offices as in Barcelona, Paris and Athens.The German military raid story has been widely debunked – see here, here, here and here.GreatGameIndia is an Indian website that has previously been the source of misinformation such as a January article that claimed China “stole” the coronavirus from Canada and turned it into a bioweapon. The falsehood went viral before it was denounced.NewsGuard describes the site as promoting “false and unsubstantiated health care conspiracy theories”, adding that it “severely violates basic standards of credibility and transparency”.Regarding Scytl’s links to the electoral commissions of Victoria and Queensland, Scytl Australia director Sam Campbell told AAP FactCheck the company provides no services to the Victorian Electoral Commission, although it is active in the Sunshine State.“Scytl currently provides training services to the staff of the Queensland Electoral Commission (ECQ) via an online service and has done this since 2015,” Mr Campbell said in an email.However, he said Scytl does not provide electronic voting machine services to either Victoria or Queensland. He added that Scytl does not tabulate, tally or count votes for elections in Queensland or Victoria.“Scytl, with its partner HP, provided limited trials to polling place vote collection to assist the blind for the 2006 and 2010 (Victorian) state elections,” Mr Campbell said. Details of those projects can be read here.He said the training services that Scytl provides for ECQ staff is “based on Queensland legislated electoral processes, and provided via an online learning management system. This has been in use variously by the ECQ since 2015 covering various state and council election events”.Scytl has also worked with the Western Australian Electoral Commission and the New South Wales Electoral Commission in relation to iVote electronic-voting systems.Questions were raised in 2019 over the security of the New South Wales system at that year’s state poll, however the New South Wales Electoral Commission said there had been no indication or possibility of interference. US military did not raid Scytl’s servers in Germany for evidence of manipulation in the US election.","https://archive.is/p1O7X,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/11/16/election-integrity/?arc404=true,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/cybersecurity-202-conspiracy-theories-are-all-thats-left-trumps-effort-overturn-election/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/14/fact-check-dominion-voting-machines-didnt-delete-switch-votes/6282157002/,https://www.scytl.com/en/,https://gohmert.house.gov/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swhlvFBsoDg&ab_channel=GohmertTX01&t=4m32s,https://greatgameindia.com/us-military-raided-scytl-germany/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbgZzA_mSpE&feature=youtu.be,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9754011363,https://www.scytl.com/en/fact-checking-regarding-us-elections-debunking-fake-news/,https://www.scytl.com/en/customers/us-elections/,https://archive.vn/LQT0K,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-election-syctl-military-idUSKBN27W1UW,https://factcheck.afp.com/dominion-voting-servers-were-not-seized-germany,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/u-s-army-didnt-seize-election-servers-in-germany/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/17/fact-check-story-army-raid-election-servers-germany-false/6313140002/,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-how-one-particular-coronavirus-myth-went-viral/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/28/blog-posting/websites-spin-conspiracy-theory-about-coronavirus-/,https://www.newsguardtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GreatGameIndia.com-2-28-20.pdf,https://www.scytl.com/en/team/management-team/sam-campbell/,https://www.scytl.com/en/customers/electoral-commission-queensland/,https://zeroproject.org/practice/scytl-secure-electronic-voting-s-a-australia-state-of-victoria/,https://www.scytl.com/en/customers/western-australian-electoral-commission-waec/,https://www.scytl.com/en/customers/new-south-wales-electoral-commission/,https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nsw-ivote-system-may-have-been-vulnerable-to-voter-fraud-at-election-533940",US army raid on voting machine company doesn’t tally up,,,,,,

He gets 15.4% super & he can access it as soon as he leaves parliament. You get 9.5%. You have to wait until 67. There is a super guarantee which will raise your super to 12%. Josh wants to stop this. That’s what his sweaty rants are about. Because f*** you.”The post is captioned: “And the unashamed Bias will continue if Workers keep voting these arseholes in!”At the time of publication, the post had been shared more than 340 times, attracting more than 380 reactions and 65 comments. The original tweet has been retweeted more than 900 times, receiving more than 3000 likes, while similar screenshots of the tweet have also been shared elsewhere on Facebook. A Facebook post claims Treasurer Josh Frydenberg can cash out his super when he leaves parliament. The AnalysisWhile Australia’s federal MPs and senators benefit from superannuation perks above those available to the wider public, the option to cash out upon leaving the parliamentary benches is only available to a handful of long-standing representatives.Only those who have been in parliament since before the 2001 election are eligible to automatically access large lump-sum payments once they exit their elected roles.In Australia, workers are entitled to a minimum superannuation contribution from employers of 9.5 per cent of their earnings. This is due to rise to 12 per cent by 2025, with the next increase, to 10 per cent, scheduled for July 1, 2021.However, media reports have suggested Mr Frydenberg may move to delay the scheduled increases following the release of an independent review into retirement income on November 20 which found lifting the rate would result in lower wages and affect living standards for workers.Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised during the 2019 election campaign to deliver the increases but has since said the government would “carefully consider” the change in the context of the COVID-19-induced economic downturn.Under the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004, federal parliamentarians already receive a 15.4 per cent superannuation contribution based on their core allowances and any additional salaries they receive as office-holders.The Act replaced an earlier scheme, under which those elected before the 2004 poll were entitled to a “retiring allowance” – a fixed pension for life – if they had served for a minimum of eight years.The allowance ranges from 50 per cent of parliamentarians’ standard pay rates at retirement for those who had served eight years up to 75 per cent for those who had served 18 years of more. There are additional benefits for those who served as ministers or other office holders.A prime minister retiring today could be entitled to a lifelong pension of up to $328,162 under the old scheme, a Department of Finance spokesman confirmed to AAP FactCheck via email.However, in order to qualify for the maximum amount they would need to have held higher parliamentary offices for several years in addition to first being elected before 2004.A newly retired parliamentarian on the base salary but covered under the earlier scheme could be entitled to a minimum pension of $125,362.Parliamentarians elected before the 2001 poll could receive their retiring allowance from the time they left parliament – and could opt to receive 50 per cent of the allowance as a lump sum.However, those elected in 2001 or before 2004 would only receive the allowance or lump sum payment once they reached the “preservation age”. This ranges from 55 to 60 depending on a person’s year of birth.All parliamentarians who first took their seats at the 2004 election or later fall under the new superannuation scheme, which remains in place.The Finance spokesman said that access to lump-sum superannuation benefits for parliamentarians was now “subject to the same conditions that apply to the broader community”.“Access to superannuation benefits is generally restricted to members who have reached preservation age on retirement,” he said.Mr Frydenberg was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, rendering him ineligible for the former pension scheme. The Treasurer would also need to wait until at least his preservation age of 60 to access any lump-sum benefits. He turned 49 in July.Other senior members of the government, such as Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, would also be ineligible for the replaced pension scheme. Mr Morrison was first elected in 2007 and Mr McCormack in 2010.Nevertheless, several elected representatives remain eligible for life-long pensions. For example, the longest-serving member of the current House of Representatives, Kevin Andrews, was first elected in 1991, entitling him to the previous benefits.While the age at which Australians can receive the state pension is currently 66, this is due to gradually increase to 67 by July 2023. However, this differs from the age at which the public can access their superannuation benefits.These funds can be accessed either at the age of 65, regardless of retirement status, or when people reach their preservation age if they retire early. Neither Scott Morrison nor Josh Frydenberg are eligible for life-long parliamentary pensions.","https://archive.is/9fQgg,https://archive.vn/N63CJ,https://www.facebook.com/106088536418308/posts/1308797529480730,https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Superguaranteepercentage,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/frydenberg-hints-at-delay-to-super-guarantee-increase-20201120-p56gcj,https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2020-100554,https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6890543/morrison-reconsiders-superannuation-rise/?cs=14350,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00009,https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/bn/1011/superannuationbenefits#:~:text=Parliamentarians%20currently%20receive%20an%20Annual,salaries%20of%20office%20and%20entitlements.,https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in-detail/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/withdrawing-your-super-and-paying-tax/?page=2#:~:text=Your%20preservation%20age%20is%20the,met%20a%20condition%20of%20release.,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=FKL,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=E3L,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=219646,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter5/Member's_titles,https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/age-pension/who-can-get-it,https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in-detail/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/withdrawing-your-super-and-paying-tax/?page=2#:~:text=Your%20preservation%20age%20is%20the,met%20a%20condition%20of%20release.",Do Australia’s politicians enjoy lavish pension perks?,,,,,,

This is a group of viruses that includes SARS and MERS.Flu is caused by distinct influenza viruses, which infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies several key differences between the flu and COVID-19, including the ease with which the coronavirus appears to spread and the seriousness of the symptoms it causes in some patients.“It can also take longer before people show symptoms (for COVID-19) and people can be contagious for longer,” the CDC says.An April article in the Journal of Paramedic Medicine explains that both the viruses and diseases they cause are distinct.“SARS-CoV-2 is a virus in the zoonotic coronavirus family. This virus, previously unknown in humans, is what is now causing the clinical illness commonly referred to as: COVID-19. Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases caused by spread from non-humans to humans,” the article says.“Influenza is a different disease, caused by a different virus. Influenza is an infection caused by a member of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) orthomyxovirus family.”Dr Lucy Telfar Barnard, a Wellington epidemiologist who has contributed to the New Zealand government’s modelling reports on COVID-19, told AAP FactCheck in an email that COVID-19 is not a “re-brand” of seasonal flu.“Even though some symptoms are similar, they’re not the same disease by any stretch,” she said.“The (COVID-19) virus is a different virus, and while there are some overlaps, the two diseases present in different ways. The claim is absolutely false.”Monique Chilver, a health researcher at the University of Adelaide and program manager for the Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network, a monitoring scheme for infectious diseases, said the two diseases had similarities which meant some flu research could be applied to COVID-19.“However, COVID-19 has a much higher morbidity and mortality rate than the seasonal flu,” she said.Another major difference between the flu and COVID-19 is that there are vaccines for the flu, while COVID-19 vaccines are only just starting to be introduced and approved for use.Comparing recorded COVID-19 deaths to flu fatalities and fatality rates is telling, as previously explored by AAP FactCheck.Between December 2019 and October 2020, COVID-19 had killed more people in the US than influenza did in five years, Johns Hopkins School Of Public Health reported.Worldwide, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed around 1.5 million lives as of December 3, according to the university’s tally. In contrast, the World Health Organization estimates there are between 290,000 to 650,000 influenza-related respiratory deaths out of three to five million severe cases in a typical year.Several of Evans’ earlier posts relating to COVID-19 have been fact-checked as false (see here, here and here). COVID-19 isn’t a made-over version of the flu – despite sharing some similar symptoms.","https://archive.is/9pkhE,https://peteevans.com,https://archive.vn/mZPAS,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/interactive-timeline,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1,https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_1.pdf,https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov),https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between,by%20infection%20with%20influenza%20viruses.,https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/full/10.12968/jpar.2020.12.4.136,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago075073.html,https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/covid-19-modelling-and-other-commissioned-reports,https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/monique.chilver#,https://aspren.dmac.adelaide.edu.au/,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.aap.com.au/lockdown-critic-says-covid-19-is-only-slightly-worse-than-the-flu/,https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/no-covid-19-is-not-the-flu.html,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://www.who.int/news/item/11-03-2019-who-launches-new-global-influenza-strategy,https://www.aap.com.au/claim-of-no-covid-19-pandemic-ignores-basic-facts/,https://www.aap.com.au/death-rate-figures-for-covid-19-dont-add-up/,https://www.aap.com.au/victoria-did-not-take-an-imf-bribe-in-return-for-lockdown/","No, COVID-19 isn’t just the flu with a makeover",,,,,,
59,,,,Partly False,,2020-12-02,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-facts101-marked-d-for-deceptive/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA meme labelled “Facts101” makes several claims about COVID-19 treatments and survival rates.“The CORONA VIRUS is so deadly the #1 treatment is to go home for 14 days until it goes away on its own,” the widely shared meme says.“(99.6% survivable with no treatment whatsoever),” it adds.One example of the meme, shared by a Facebook user in Australia on October 29, had been shared more than 200 times at the time of writing, while other posts containing the meme date back to at least October 13. A Facebook post claims almost all COVID-19 patients survive the illness without treatment. The AnalysisThe post makes two claims about the coronavirus pandemic: that the top treatment is staying at home, and nearly all of those infected with COVID-19 survive without any treatment.While the still unfolding nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to determine COVID-19’s ultimate impact on patients, the post falters under scrutiny.It claims that “the #1 treatment” for the disease is staying at home for 14 days “until it goes away”.However, Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong, said staying at home isn’t “the number-one treatment” for many people with COVID-19.“It’s certainly not true to say that the best treatment is to sit at home, especially for people requiring intensive support,” he told AAP Factcheck via email.“Hospitals don’t fill up with people who are happily sitting at home, and that while there are asymptomatic infections – about 20 per cent of all infections according to current best evidence – many people have quite severe illness even if they survive.”According to data from The Atlantic’s COVID Tracking Project, 98,691 people were hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US alone on December 1, the highest figure since the start of the pandemic.Many of these people are likely to die, although studies have shown that the fatality rate among those requiring hospital treatment has fallen significantly as the pandemic has progressed.One New York hospital study found adjusted mortality rates among hospitalised patients fell from 25.6 per cent in March to 7.6 per cent in August.In an article on The Conversation, University of California professor of clinical medicine Monica Gandhi said the decline in hospital deaths was mainly due to improvements in COVID-19 treatments since March, including the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone for hospitalised patients.Dr Michael Maze, an infectious disease and respiratory physician at the University of Otago, told AAP FactCheck that while staying at home and quarantining is the advice for those who are mildly affected, it’s not recommended for all.“(The post) does ignore the fact that there are proven treatments for those with severe disease (e.g. dexamethasone and remdesivir), and that intensive supportive care is needed for many too,” he said in an email.The post also claims that the virus is “99.6% survivable” without treatment, however the chance of a person with COVID-19 dying as a result of the illness is unclear due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, as previously explained by AAP FactCheck.The Johns Hopkins University Mortality Analyses placed the death rate among observed cases of COVID-19 at two per cent in the United States and 3.6 per cent in the United Kingdom on December 1. These figures do not allow for undiagnosed cases or uncounted deaths and vary widely from country to country.An analysis of infection fatality rates – the proportion of deaths among all likely infected people – published in the British Medical Journal (page 1) in August predicted death rates would range from 0.43 per cent in western sub-Saharan Africa to 1.45 per cent in Eastern Europe based on the countries’ demographics and health systems.The World Health Organization has written about the difficulty of pinning down the COVID-19 death rate, noting that delayed reporting and lack of testing for mild and asymptomatic cases complicate the process.Mr Meyerowitz-Katz, who has written for the International Journal of Infectious Diseases on COVID-19 fatality rates, said the overall death rate for the disease was “certainly” higher than the 0.4 per cent claimed in the post.“It’s more like 0.7 per cent-plus in most developed countries, and is highly dependent on age. A 20-year-old has a one in 10,000 risk of death, but for a 60-year-old it’s closer to one in 100 and for those above 80 it’s nearly one in 10,” he said.Dr Craig Dalton, a clinical epidemiologist from the University of Newcastle,  said based on Australia’s COVID-19 figures – 908 deaths and 27,912 cases as of December 1 – it was “fair to say 97 per cent will survive”, although he also noted that scientists were still studying the disease’s long-term effects on survivors.“A proportion (of patients) of course will have had a horrible time in ICU and post-ICU traumatic distress, many will have lungs that do not work as well and we are still investigating long-term cognitive impacts of the illness,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email.Nevertheless, Dr Maze said the post was “right in principle” that the vast majority of people infected with the virus will survive.“COVID-19 is not a death sentence on an individual level for young healthy people … the concern is when large numbers of people get it at once, a lot will die and that for some groups the risk of death is much higher,” he said. COVID-19 fatality rates are very low among the young but rise dramatically for older patients.","https://archive.vn/8ADWL,https://www.facebook.com/100912665023804/posts/162852735496463,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/gideon-meyerowitz-katz,https://covidtracking.com/data/national,https://theconversation.com/death-rates-have-fallen-by-18-for-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-as-treatments-improve-148775,https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/230561/hospital-medicine/trends-covid-19-risk-adjusted-mortality-rates?channel=28090#jhm1511-sec-0003,https://theconversation.com/death-rates-have-fallen-by-18-for-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-as-treatments-improve-148775,https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/monica-gandhi,https://www.otago.ac.nz/christchurch/departments/medicine/people/michael-maze.html,https://www.aap.com.au/is-there-more-chance-of-an-asteroid-hitting-earth-than-dying-from-covid-19/,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality,https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/5/9/e003094.full.pdf,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32180-9/fulltext,https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/craig-dalton,https://archive.vn/a8oiu",COVID-19 ‘Facts101’ marked D for deceptive,,,,,,
60,,,,Partly False,,2020-12-02,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/will-drinking-beer-ferment-major-health-benefits/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims drinking beer provides a range of health benefits – including preventing cancer.The image-based post is titled “Health Benefits of Beer” and features a list of positive health effects supposedly brought on by enjoying the amber liquid. These include improved bone density and digestion, as well as the prevention of cancer, diabetes, gallstones and dementia.At the time of writing, the May 2018 post from an India-managed page had been shared more than 8,500 times and received more than 6,400 reactions and 800 comments. It has been shared by several users in Fiji, among those from other countries. A post claims drinking beer provides a range of health benefits including preventing cancer. The AnalysisWhile ale aficionados may welcome beer being declared the next superfood, many of the benefits listed in the Facebook post are overstated, while others are false or subject to conflicting medical evidence.AAP FactCheck examined some of the post’s most dubious health claims.Does beer prevent cancer? Not according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which advises: “The less alcohol you drink, the lower your risk for cancer.”It goes on to state that “drinking any kind of alcohol can contribute to cancers of the mouth and throat, larynx, esophagus, colon, rectum, liver, and breast (in women)”.The American Cancer Society also says alcohol consumption is linked to multiple types of cancers, and advises that “the more alcohol you drink, the higher your cancer risk”.A 2015 paper published by the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health estimated 3,208 cancer cases occurring in Australian adults in 2010 could be attributed to alcohol consumption. That was 2.8 per cent of the national total for all cancers in the year.In a 2017 editorial, The Lancet medical journal noted: “Historical assertions of benefit from alcohol are likely misinterpreted or exaggerated, because no lower threshold for cancer risk has yet been identified.”The editorial goes on to detail the carcinogenic danger posed by alcohol, describing the scale of the problem as “immense”.“For example, a three times increase in the recommended alcohol limit raises the risk of oesophageal cancer eight times, leading to estimates that three-quarters of oesophageal cancers are due to high alcohol consumption. Because cancer of the oesophagus has a five-year survival rate of less than 10 per cent, prevention is paramount.”For the claim that beer protects the heart, the answer is not clear and depends heavily on the amount of alcohol consumed, according to Harvard Medical School.A 2018 Harvard Health Publishing article said existing research was conflicting, with some studies saying alcohol improved heart health while others implied the oppositeIt quotes Michael Gaziano, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, as saying that no large-scale trials had provided a clear causal link between alcohol consumption and heart health benefits.“Therefore, you can’t say for certain whether alcohol plays an essential role in reducing common heart disease risk factors like high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure,” he said.NUI Galway cardiology professor Bill McEvoy offered a similar assessment in an article published by Johns Hopkins Medicine.On the claim that beer improves bone density, Ian Reid, a professor of medicine at the University of Auckland and a leading figure in bone research, told AAP FactCheck that “there is some evidence that older women who have a low to moderate alcohol intake have better bone densities than those who drink nothing”.“However, more than two drinks per day is associated with an increased risk of fractures,” Prof Reid said. “No one would advocate drinking beer as a way of reducing fracture risk.”Regarding the claim beer prevents anaemia, a 2004 study by the American Gastroenterology Association linked alcohol consumption with a decrease in iron-deficiency anaemia.The study of 20,511 people concluded that “consumption of any amount of alcohol was associated with a reduction in the risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in the US population”.However, Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology and scientific director of the New Zealand Nutrition Foundation, said the benefits identified in the study may be overstated.“Association does not mean cause and effect,” Prof Rush told AAP FactCheck in an email. “You can’t just suddenly start consuming a lot of beer and expect any sort of benefits just from that one product.”Alcohol consumption has also been linked to accelerating – rather than delaying – ageing, according to a 2017 study published in the British Medical Journal.The Danish study of 11,600 adults investigated whether alcohol and smoking are associated with four visible age-related sign. It noted that “looking old for one’s age is associated with poor health, cardiovascular disease and early death”.It found that “high alcohol consumption and smoking predict development of visible age-related signs”, although it also noted that low-to-moderate alcohol intake had been linked to lower all-cause mortality in previous studies.A fact sheet from the US National Institute on Aging lists a host of health conditions – including cancer, liver damage, immune system disorders, brain damage, diabetes and high blood pressure – which either develop or worsen by drinking too much alcohol over a long period.There is also some research to show that heavy drinking can increase the risk of developing dementia. A 2018 French study that examined data for more than a million adults with dementia found that alcohol dependence was the “strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset”. Does beer prevent cancer? Not according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","https://archive.is/aSdix,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/alcohol/index.htm,https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.12456,https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2817%2932868-4,https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/facts-about-alcohol-and-heart-health,http://researchfaculty.brighamandwomens.org/BRIProfile.aspx?id=1544,http://www.nuigalway.ie/medicine-nursing-and-health-sciences/staff-profiles/johnwilliammcevoy/,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/alcohol-and-heart-health-separating-fact-from-fiction,https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/professor-ian-reid/,https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/s0016-5085(04)00094-0/fulltext#:~:text=Consumption%20of%20any%20amount%20of,the%20risk%20of%20iron%20overload.,https://www.aut.ac.nz/research/professors-listing/elaine-rush,https://nutritionfoundation.org.nz/about-us/Our-People,https://www.sdu.dk/sif/-/media/images/sif/sidste_chance/sif/ugens+tal/oevrige_kilder_til_ut/alcohol_consumption_smoking_and_development_of_visible_age_related_signs.pdf,https://www.sdu.dk/sif/-/media/images/sif/sidste_chance/sif/ugens+tal/oevrige_kilder_til_ut/alcohol_consumption_smoking_and_development_of_visible_age_related_signs.pdf,https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/facts-about-aging-and-alcohol,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30022-7/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr",Will drinking beer ferment major health benefits?,,,,,,
61,,,,False,,2020-11-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/social-media-beef-over-mcdonalds-burgers-is-all-sizzle-no-steak/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media meme that claims McDonald’s burgers are not 100 per cent beef continues to be widely shared in Australia and New Zealand.The meme, included in this post on the Facebook page Get Cancer Cure, claims that McDonald’s hamburgers are only 15 per cent “real beef”.“The other 85% is meat filler cleansed with Ammonia which causes stomach and intestinal cancer,” the meme reads.The November 2019 post had been shared 195 times and generated more than 100 reactions at the time of writing. An older post featuring the same meme had been shared more than 296,000 times with more than 21,000 comments and 43,000 reactions. A post claiming McDonald’s burgers are not 100% beef is being widely shared in Australia and NZ. The AnalysisConsumer campaigns over the contents of McDonald’s hamburgers are nothing new. The claims in the meme were addressed by the US fast food giant in 2011, when it stopped using so-called “meat filler” in its burgers.The practice was brought to the attention of the wider public by UK celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who campaigned against the use of the meat product.Oliver branded meat filler – made up of treated lean beef trimmings used as a cheap bulking agent –  as “pink slime” in an episode of the chef’s Food Revolution program that highlight its production process.The processing involves the use of ammonium hydroxide to kill pathogens in the meat, although experts say the quantity of the chemical ingested by consumers doesn’t pose any health risks such as causing cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration has also cleared the process as safe.A 2009 New York Times article probed the use of ammonia in processed beef, which along with other reports fuelled a “stop pink slime” movement in the US.McDonald’s ended its use of “lean beef trimmings treated with ammonia, what some individuals call ‘pink slime'” in 2011, according to a 2013 statement from the fast food giant.It said the company used pure beef with “no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders” in the US after ending its use of ammonia-treated meet filler – which it described as a safe product.Since then, social media claims about McDonald’s use of “pink slime” in burgers have repeatedly resurfaced – and been debunked (see here, here and here).McDonald’s has taken the step of open its doors to prove its burgers are made of 100 per cent beef. British YouTube host Doug Armstrong followed the company’s production process from the farm to the restaurant in this 2015 video, as did the late Mythbusters co-host Grant Imahara in this investigation.McDonald’s New Zealand spokesman Simon Kenny told AAP FactCheck in an email that the company now had a global standard of using 100 per cent real beef. In New Zealand, the beef was entirely locally sourced.“The beef is sent to ANZCO Foods in Waitara, Taranaki, where it is made into beef patties. The beef is minced, formed and then snap frozen, meaning no added binders or fillers are required,” he said.The company also says its Australian burgers contain 100 per cent locally sourced beef. Ammonium hydroxide is not listed as an approved food additive in either Australia or New Zealand.In a video, New Zealand McDonald’s franchisee Peter Foster responds to a customer question asking: “Is it true that the beef patties are washed in ammonium hydroxide?”“The answer is no,” Mr Foster says. “The beef patties do not get washed in ammonia or ammonium hydroxide or any of that pink slime business that you hear people talking about.”McDonald’s also addresses the question in the Q&A section on its US website. McDonald’s said 100 per cent real beef was a global standard for the company.","https://archive.is/DgQ1W,https://archive.vn/1ox5w,https://www.livescience.com/33786-pink-slime.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObcsswhO83I&feature=youtu.be,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonium-hydroxide,https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/controversial-science-food-health-you-asked/you-asked-can-consuming-food-such-beef-treated-ammonia-hydroxide-potentially-cause-any-health,https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1139,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html?pagewanted=all,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/05/23/the-pink-slime-saga-continues/,https://web.archive.org/web/20201024145730/http://news.mcdonalds.com/media-statements/food-details/discontinued-use-select-lean-beef-trimmings-slbt,https://consumerist.com/2014/05/13/dont-believe-the-social-media-hype-no-mcdonalds-doesnt-use-pink-slime-in-burgers/,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mcdonalds-addresses-pink-slime-claims-2014-5?r=US&IR=T,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mcdonalds-100-beef/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8VBYnByPds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6IMQaiYKeg,https://mcdonalds.com.au/maccas-food/whats-in-it,https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/additives/additiveoverview/Documents/Food%20additives%20-%20alphabetical%20May%202019.pdf,https://youtu.be/YSOv6Uhbva0,https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/our-food-your-questions/22906-do-you-use-so-called-pink-slime-in-your-burgers-or-beef-treated-with-ammonia.html",Social media beef over McDonald’s burgers is all sizzle no steak,,,,,,
62,,,,Partly False,,2020-11-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/can-victoria-businesses-refuse-entry-to-maskless-customers/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAs Victoria eases its mandatory mask rules for people in outdoor settings, a social media post claims it is “disability discrimination” for businesses to refuse people entry for not wearing a mask.The post shared by the Facebook page Reignite Democracy Australia on November 21 features a screenshot of an article from The Age which states: “Businesses can refuse entry to shoppers who are not covering their faces.”The article goes on to state that several major retailers, including the Wesfarmers-owned Bunnings, Officeworks and Kmart, “bar unmasked customers from entering their stores, unless they have an exemption”.The post’s caption claims that “The Age should be sued for inciting unlawful behaviour”.It continues, “In this article they say that businesses can refuse entry to those not wearing a mask, they are WRONG! It’s disability discrimination.“Why is it so hard for them to read the (Department of Health and Human Services) guidelines. It’s there in black and white that you cannot ask to see someone’s exemption and you cannot refuse them entry.”Reignite Democracy Australia states it is an “advocacy group representing citizens of Australia”. The page has previously posted false information about COVID-19 testing, and suggested vaccines to prevent the virus were “designed by men who want to depopulate the world”.The Facebook post had been viewed more than 19,000 times at the time of writing, attracting more than 70 shares, 720 reactions and 280 comments. A Facebook post claims it’s “disability discrimination” to refuse entry to people not wearing masks. The AnalysisBusinesses in Victoria can refuse people entry or service for not wearing masks, however that power does come with limits under the state’s mask rules.Retailers and other enterprises cannot bar entry or service to anyone with a lawful reason for not wearing a mask – such as a medical condition – and people are not required to show proof such as a medical certificate to support their excuse.In July, the Victorian state government implemented mandatory mask rules for people living in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire when leaving their homes in a bid to control the “concerning increase in coronavirus cases”. The edict was extended to the rest of the state in August.While mask-wearing was made compulsory with non-compliance punishable with a $200 fine, there were also a number of exceptions. They included exceptions for children under the age of 12, those with medical excuses, and in situations when mask-wearing wasn’t practical, such as during exercise.After a tough lockdown followed by a run of 23 straight days of zero new COVID-19 cases, the government announced the easing of face mask rules from November 22.The new rules stipulate that masks are no longer required outdoors where it is possible to stay 1.5 metres apart, but they remain mandatory in outdoor areas where social distancing is not possible and in all indoor locations, such as in shopping centres or on public transport.Exceptions under the new rules are similar to those in place with the previous restrictions, and include exemptions for those “affected by a relevant medical condition, including problems with their breathing, a serious condition of the face, a disability or a mental health condition”.According to the DHHS, businesses and service providers can refuse entry or service to people who are not wearing a face mask, unless they have a lawful exemption.However, a DHHS spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck in an email that people who have a lawful reason for not wearing a face mask in a shop do not need to apply for a formal exemption or permit, or show a medical certificate.“A business owner will not be fined if a customer refuses to wear a face mask without a lawful excuse. The penalty would be applied to the customer,” she said.The DHHS guidelines note that people with disabilities must also wear face masks, unless “it is unsuitable to do so for medical, physical, communication or other individual risk factors”.The Victorian Equal Opportunity & Human Rights Commission says a person who alerts a shop owner of a disability which prevents them from wearing a face mask but is still refused entry or service, can make a complaint under the Equal Opportunity Act as this may amount to unlawful discrimination.“If you do not have a disability that affects your ability to wear a face mask or covering and are refused entry or service by a shop owner, you are unlikely to meet the requirements of the lawful exception to public health orders – and the refusal of entry or service is unlikely to be discrimination,” the commission says.It adds that anyone making a discrimination complaint because they were refused service needs to demonstrate “a clear link between their disability and inability to wear a face mask or covering”. Victorian businesses can refuse entry to people not wearing masks unless they have a lawful excuse.","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-22/victoria-daniel-andrews-on-coronavirus-restrictions-changes/12907456,https://archive.vn/fXyxa,https://www.facebook.com/reignitedemocracyaustralia/about/?ref=page_internal,https://archive.vn/tBAMA,https://archive.vn/TYQ8h,https://archive.vn/igv4m,https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/new-victorian-covid-restrictions-include-changed-mask-rules-c-1631485,https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/coronavirus-update-victoria-22-november-2020,https://archive.vn/l1IIf,https://archive.vn/l1IIf#exceptions-for-not-wearing-a-face-mask,https://archive.vn/l1IIf#shopping-and-retail,https://www.humanrights.vic.gov.au/resources/faqs-face-masks-and-human-rights/",Can Victoria businesses refuse entry to maskless customers?,,,,,,

The president-elect’s actions can also not be reasonably compared to those of Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying about his dealings with Russia, they said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison and US president-elect Joe Biden spoke over the phone on November 12, when Mr Morrison congratulated Mr Biden “on his election”, according to a tweet from the Australian leader.At a subsequent press conference, Mr Morrison said both leaders reaffirmed their “strong commitment to strengthening our alliance”, adding that the Australian government would work with the US administration “respecting (the) protocols” during the post-election transition period.It was one of several congratulatory calls fielded by Mr Biden, who spoke with the leaders of Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, among others, following the US election despite President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede.The claim that Mr Biden potentially breached the Logan Act through the congratulatory conversations before he was sworn in as president began circulating among conservative politicians and commentators well before the call with Mr Morrison.On November 10, Republican Senator Ted Cruz suggested that Mr Biden’s team had potentially violated the Act – comparing his behaviour to that of Mr Flynn – a theme picked up by Fox News host Sean Hannity on November 11.Mr Flynn resigned from his role as national security adviser in February 2017 after he admitted he had “held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers and ambassadors” and that he “inadvertently” provided “incomplete information” about his calls with the Russian ambassador to then vice president-elect Mike Pence.He pleaded guilty to falsely stating that the calls didn’t include a request for Russia to refrain from escalating tensions following US sanctions on the country, among other claims. He was never charged with violating the Logan Act.He later attempted to withdraw the guilty plea, and on November 26 Mr Trump announced he was pardoning Mr Flynn.The Logan Act was passed by the US Congress in 1798 and formally enacted in 1799 after George Logan, a Pennsylvania state legislator, tried to negotiate with the French government as a private citizen in a bid to prevent a war between the two countries.The Act’s aim is to prevent any US citizen from undertaking unauthorised negotiations with foreign governments and officials to influence their actions on issues concerning the United States.Michael W. McConnell, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford Law School, told AAP FactCheck he believed neither Mr Biden nor Mr Flynn violated the Logan Act, although the video could be accused of exaggerating the similarities between the two examples.Prof McConnell said in an email it was standard practice for the foreign policy officials of an incoming administration to communicate with their foreign counterparts prior to the inauguration.“The Logan Act does not forbid all communications between Americans and foreign leaders. It prohibits such communications made ‘with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States’,” he said.“By no possible measure did Biden’s communication fall into that category. Flynn was a closer case, though it would be ridiculous to apply the Act to communications of that sort during the transition.”Daniel Hemel, a professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School, told AAP FactCheck in an email that Mr Biden had not violated the Logan Act by accepting congratulatory calls from world leaders.He added that Mr Biden’s conversations weren’t “even remotely comparably” to Mr Flynn’s case as the retired general “allegedly sought to flip votes at the UN Security Council so as to undermine the Obama administration’s Middle East policy”.Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, agreed, telling AAP FactCheck in an email the suggestion Mr Biden violated the Logan Act by speaking with Mr Morrison was without foundation.“(The Act) is in no respect applicable to this kind of entirely routine interchange between a president-elect and a foreign prime minister or head of state,” he said.“It is such a vague and nebulous restriction on discussions by private American citizens with foreign leaders that most constitutional scholars (including me) believe its application would be barred by the first amendment to our constitution.”It’s not the first time a US political figure has been accused of breaching the Logan Act due to their interactions with Australian representatives.In 2017, Republican senator John McCain was baselessly accused online of breaching the Act in 2017 after he called Australia’s then ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, to reassure Australia of the two countries’ longstanding alliance following a tense phone call between Mr Trump and then Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.Only two cases have ever led to an indictment under the Logan Act and no convictions have ever been recorded in its 221-year history. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called to congratulate US president-elect Joe Biden.","https://www.lionheartaustralasia.com/about-riccardo-bosi  ,https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/SenateStateFirstPrefs-24310-NSW.htm,https://results.aec.gov.au/25820/Website/HouseDivisionPage-25820-117.htm,https://results1.elections.qld.gov.au/state2020/nicklin/primary,https://archive.vn/95ZUj,https://www.youtube.com/user/joeljammal/about,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Flynn,https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1326682544272666625/photo/1,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-10,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/12/more-world-leaders-congratulate-biden-than-us-republicans,https://youtu.be/ag0FSFqhjqk,https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/trump-campaign-demands-transparency-accountability-in-vote-audit-push,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/flynn-resignation-ltr.pdf,https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55080923,https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-3/the-logan-act,https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/953,https://law.stanford.edu/directory/michael-w-mcconnell/ ,https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/hemel ,https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10899/Tribe/ ,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/feb/21/blog-posting/did-john-mccain-violate-logan-act-call-australian-/,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10058.pdf",Did Scott Morrison ‘help’ Joe Biden violate the Logan Act with a phone call?,,,,,,
64,,,,Missing Context,,2020-11-26,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-a-new-study-show-masks-are-ineffective-at-stopping-covid-19-infection/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post suggests a new study shows that masks are ineffective at preventing COVID-19 infection.The post discusses the findings of a Danish study, which compared the incidence of the coronavirus in a group that were told to wear masks and a group that did not wear them.The post describes the results and includes a diagram showing a small difference in the number of people who caught COVID-19 in the two groups, which it said was “not distinguishable from a chance finding”.“This is probably the best evidence we have up to now, which is disappointing for advocates of mask use to prevent covid-19 infection,” the post reads.“This evidence is consistent with previous trials which found no effect in trials designed to assess the effect of masks to prevent the community transmission of influenza.”At the time of writing, the November 19 post had more than 100 reactions and 50 shares.It was posted by COVID Plan B, a group of seven New Zealand academics including three health science lecturers. The group claims the risks of the virus have been overstated and efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are more harmful than the virus itself. The group has more than 2300 followers on Facebook and has made several posts about the Danish study. It also posted a YouTube clip of COVID Plan B spokesperson and University of Auckland epidemiologist Simon Thornley discussing the study’s findings. In the video, he says: “The evidence is strongly pointing in the direction of masks not being effective in a community setting”. A post claims a new study shows that masks are ineffective at preventing COVID-19 infection. The AnalysisResearchers in Denmark published a study in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine on November 18 which set out to determine whether recommending people wear masks reduced infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.It included a randomised control trial involving more than 6000 people, half of whom were asked to wear surgical masks in public while half were placed in a control group.After a month, the participants were tested for the virus to determine whether masks reduced the number of people who contracted the illness.The study found 2.1 per cent of the control group were infected compared to 1.8 per cent of the mask-wearing group, a result that researchers said was not statistically significant.It said the findings had a 95 per cent confidence interval compatible with mask use leading to anywhere from a 46 per cent reduction to a 23 per cent increase in infection for wearers.The study said 46 per cent of the mask group wore the coverings as recommended, while 47 per cent wore them predominantly as recommended, and seven per cent not as recommended.In conclusion, the authors said the recommendation to wear masks “did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50 per cent”.But they added that this did not mean masks were ineffective because the study did not look at whether masks limited the spread of the virus from infected people, which is called “source control”.“The findings … should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the study said.“While we await additional data to inform mask recommendations, communities must balance the seriousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about the degree of source control and protective effect, and the absence of data suggesting serious adverse effects of masks.”University of Otago epidemiologist and public health professor Michael Baker noted that the study did not show masks were ineffective at reducing community transmission of the virus.Prof Baker said the main benefit of masks was not to protect the wearer from infection, but to prevent the mask wearer from spreading disease.“There is nothing at all surprising about the findings of the Danish study and it no way alters or contradicts the current understanding of how masks operate for mass masking,” he told AAP FactCheck during a phone interview.“The main purpose of mass masking is not to protect the wearer, so the Danish study is really not the one you would use to work out whether mass masking is working or not.”He said the study found masks had a small protective effect, although this was not statistically significant due to the sample size in the study.Prof Baker said masks were known to effectively protect the wearer in a medical setting, but this required high-quality masks and face shields to protect the eyes.“We already know that very high-quality masks that are worn robustly by people are effective. That’s what healthcare workers use and if you really believe that masks have no benefit then why are healthcare workers using them at all. It’s a matter of life or death for them.”University of Otago public health professor Nick Wilson, who has published articles on the efficacy of masks (see examples here and here), said the Danish study had many limitations.The study listed its limitations as including inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, and patients self-reported findings based on home tests.However, Prof Wilson told AAP FactCheck via email: “Public health action in an ongoing pandemic emergency should be guided by the totality of the scientific evidence – which favours mask use – especially in indoor environments.”University of Auckland associate professor and microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles said it was misleading to claim the Danish study found masks were ineffective.Dr Wiles said the main benefit of mask use was to prevent infected people from spreading COVID-19 and the study did not look at this.Both the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend people wear masks to slow the spread of the virus.The CDC recommends everyone over the age of two should wear a mask in public and around visitors at home.A recent CDC report on masks said cloth masks could block up to 50-70 per cent of the fine droplets and particles that people exhale. It cited a number of observational studies that found masks reduced the transmission of COVID-19.WHO released advice on masks in June, which recommended the public wear them in a number of instances, including where physical distancing was difficult, like on public transport (page 7, table 2).It cited numerous studies, including ones that looked at the efficacy of masks for controlling influenza (page 6), however the report noted that was “no direct evidence (from studies on COVID-19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19”.When contacted by AAP FactCheck, Dr Thornley didn’t dispute that the Danish study did not look at whether masks were effective at reducing community transmission.He said there was evidence to support the use of masks, but research that found masks were beneficial was largely from observation studies and not randomised trials.“Generally, meta-analyses of randomised trials are considered the highest level of evidence,” Dr Thornley said.“To my knowledge, meta-analyses of trials for use of masks to prevent transmission of influenza do not demonstrate benefit of the use of masks.”He pointed to a meta-analysis, published in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in May, that included 10 randomised control trials investigating whether face masks were effective in reducing influenza.The study said it “did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility”. However, the authors noted “most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group”.A PolitiFact fact check found it was incorrect to state the meta-analysis proved masks were ineffective; it was more accurate to say it found a lack of evidence.One of the report’s authors said suggestions that the study found masks were ineffective were “confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence”. The CDC and World Health Organization recommend people wear masks to slow the spread of COVID-19.","https://archive.is/7kz0P,https://www.covidplanb.co.nz/,https://www.covidplanb.co.nz/manifesto/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPC_f9nCfxU&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR2A77J94iCBVdQoXguBiESNulJ9Zf7mWQ2VlhIqj9jnoGVcOtjrlsypELA,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-thornley,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817?fbclid=IwAR1OpFcmyyYZzzksV330COtYpYzchJQxQ0FYLCvMXNAg-HZyxpvW88dhGNk,https://www.dummies.com/education/science/biology/confidence-interval-basics/,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024831.html,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024455.html,https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/mass-masking-an-alternative-to-a-second-lockdown-in-aotearoa,https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/pubhealthexpert/2020/05/11/the-strong-case-for-mask-requirements-in-public-transportation-and-border-control-settings-in-nzs-current-covid-19-pandemic-context/,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817?fbclid=IwAR1OpFcmyyYZzzksV330COtYpYzchJQxQ0FYLCvMXNAg-HZyxpvW88dhGNk&,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-wiles,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html?fbclid=IwAR28PppCa6x2uxwO8Z2baHM0KHS4JXx0inzzMQs3zRHV1qql_0a8mxZfpCw,https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1279750/retrieve,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/31/facebook-posts/no-cdc-who-study-does-not-prove-masks-do-not-preve/",Does a new study show masks are ineffective at stopping COVID-19 infection?,,,,,,
65,,,,False,,2020-11-25,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/soap-and-cotton-ball-tick-removal-advice-gets-a-big-cross/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims that “a nurse discovered a safe, easy way to remove ticks”, adding that the parasites will “automatically withdraw themselves” when you follow her simple instructions.“Apply a glob of liquid soap to a cotton ball. Cover the tick with the soap-soaked cotton ball and swab it for a few seconds (15-20); the tick will come out on its own and be stuck to the cotton ball when you lift it away,” the post reads.One version of the post, from 2013, continues to circulate on Facebook and has been shared by users in New Zealand among other countries. It had amassed more than 27,000 shares at the time of writing, while more recent versions of the same advice have also attracted hundreds of shares (see example here). A Facebook post claims “a safe, easy way to remove ticks” is by using liquid soap and a cotton ball. The AnalysisDespite being shared widely for years, the Facebook post’s easy tick remedy doesn’t hold up to inspection. Experts told AAP FactCheck that the recommended way to remove the parasite is either by freezing, or using tweezers, forceps or a tick remover.Ticks are spider-like parasitic arachnids that attach themselves to other animals – including humans – to feed on their blood. They use a “mouthful of hooks” to attach themselves deeply to the skin to ingest blood. In the process, they can transmit bacteria, viruses, and other ailments through their saliva.The serious tick-borne infection, Lyme disease, while common in other countries, is not believed to be present in Australia or New Zealand.There are about 70 species of ticks in Australia and more than 800 around the world. However, the “soapy cotton ball” remedy in the Facebook post isn’t recommended as a way to remove them.“It is not a safe way to remove ticks,” Professor Stephen Doggett, director of the Department of Medical Entomology, NSW Health Pathology at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, told AAP FactCheck via email.For the Australian paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus) found on the east coast, Prof Doggett recommended they be killed in place by “freezing with an ether-based spray or dabbed with a permethrin-based scabies cream”.Australia has the highest prevalence of tick-related allergies in world, according to Dr Sheryl van Nunen, an immunologist and clinical associate professor at Sydney Medical School University of Sydney in a video for Tick Induced Allergies Research and Awareness (TIARA).Both Prof Doggett and Dr van Nunen appeared on Channel 7’s Morning Show earlier this month to discuss tick safety in Australia. For tick removal, Dr van Nunen advised: “Don’t disturb the tick. Don’t scratch anything you can’t see because it could be a tick. Freeze it, leave it to drop off, because removing it is quite difficult.”Dr van Nunen said another removal option is to use fine-tipped forceps.In a statement to AAP FactCheck, the New Zealand Ministry of Health recommended using tweezers or tick removers.“Advice provided to the Ministry of Health is that ticks are safely removed by using fine tweezers or tick removers (tick removers can be purchased in pharmacies or online stores),” the statement said.“The advice says ticks must be grabbed with the tweezers close to the skin, and pulled out at the angle the tick is attached. This helps to limit the risk of breaking the tick’s mouthparts. A secondary infection can occur if the mouthparts get stuck in the skin.”“The skin needs to be disinfected once the tick has been removed,” the statement added.The Australian Department of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the use of fine-tipped tweezers.Australian health officials also advise against using “folklore remedies such as matches or pins because they will irritate the tick and make it harder to completely remove”, while the CDC provides similar advice to avoid purported methods such as “‘painting’ the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat to make the tick detach from the skin”.Similar claims about tick removal to those included in the post have been previously debunked (here, here and here). Australia has the highest prevalence of tick-related allergies in world, an expert says.","https://archive.is/zjoFO,https://www.facebook.com/503423689742036/posts/2971113152973065,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279240/,https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks,https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html,http://www.mja.com.au/journal/2016/205/9/does-lyme-disease-exist-australia,https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/environmental-health/pests-and-insects/ticks,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-tick-bite-prevention.htm,https://www.tiara.org.au/stephen-doggett-bsc#:~:text=Stephen%20,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-tick-bite-prevention.htm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084664/,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Permethrin,https://www.tiara.org.au/associate-prof-sheryl-van-nunen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8TYZKn2Msk&feature=youtu.be,https://www.tiara.org.au,https://7news.com.au/the-morning-show/story-info/experts-explain-what-a-tick-is-and-how-to-safely-remove-them-from-your-body-c-1616793,https://www.health.govt.nz,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/EA2FA455F96F36F1CA257C3700786BCB/$File/Preventing-treating-tick-bites.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html,https://factcheck.afp.com/best-way-remove-tick-fine-tipped-tweezers-not-soap-and-cotton-ball,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/liquid-soap-ticks/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/07/facebook-posts/no-liquid-soap-not-effective-way-remove-ticks-use-/",Soap and cotton ball tick-removal advice gets a big cross,,,,,,

While our population hits 5.1 million, no new hospitals are being built and the health budget is $400 million in deficit!”At the time of publication, the October 12 post had been shared more than 140 times, attracting more than 50 reactions and 15,00 views.It was posted by the NZ Observer Facebook account, which states in its “about” section: “The NZ Observer is part of the Oxford media group in Wellington. We comment on issues we find topical. We offer a very informal opinion and look forward to comments from readers.”AAP FactCheck was unable to identify any “Oxford media group” based in Wellington. The Facebook page, created in July 2019, posts frequent memes critical of the Labour government and opposing immigration. A Facebook post claims 500,000 New Zealanders are waiting for hospital treatment. The AnalysisThe Facebook post does not include any sources for the claim that “a staggering report” found 500,000 New Zealanders were waiting for hospital treatment.However, a report from November 2019 titled Hospitals on the Edge and commissioned by the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS) estimated there were “potentially 430,000 children and adults with an unmet need for hospital care” (page 12).These figures were based on a 2017 pilot study, published in the New Zealand Medical Journal, which investigated methods for a possible future national survey to measure unmet healthcare need in NZ.The study included interviews with 1277 people in Auckland and Christchurch between November 2015 and February 2016. They were asked if they had not received secondary health care that had been recommended by a doctor or other health professional in the previous five years (page 26).It found 9.3 per cent reported an unmet healthcare need in that period. Of that nine per cent, 63 per cent required a consultation and 39 per cent required a procedure (page 29).Of those who needed but had not received secondary care, the most common reason given by respondents was because the procedure was “not available at public hospital/below public hospital threshold” (44.5 per cent) or was unaffordable (26.9 per cent). Another 9.2 per cent of respondents said they were on a waiting list (page 30).The survey results were not weighted to reflect the population: the average age of respondents was 54.4 (page 28), well above the median age of 36.2 for men and 38.5 for women, nor did it include children (page 25).The ASMA report applied the nine per cent figure to the entire population in 2019 to arrive at the figure of 430,000 children and adults with an unmet need for hospital care (page 12/13).As the original survey was conducted in 2015/16, it gauged unmet needs under the previous National-led government and does not provide information on whether demand had increased or decreased under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s Labour-led administration.In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health told AAP FactCheck its records showed there were 49,725 people waiting for hospital treatment as of September 30, 2020.The Facebook post also claims no new hospitals were being built in New Zealand, however work has started on clearing the site for a new hospital in Dunedin which is due to be completed by 2028. It will be the largest hospital ever built in the country.A new hospital also opened in Christchurch in November, a facility double the size of the previous location. A new hospital opened in Greymouth in July.Meanwhile, budget deficits among New Zealand’s district health boards (DHBs) have been reported widely.The Ministry of Health said the projected deficit for DHBs in the 2020/21 financial year is $397 million.The Ministry’s website shows the unaudited deficit for all DHBs for the year to June 30, 2020 was $497 million, but the figure rises to $874 million when costs associated with COVID-19 and back-paying holiday pay are accounted for. New Zealand’s health system is in expected to be in deficit this year.","https://archive.vn/10nN2,https://www.asms.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12671-Hospitals-on-the-Edge-WEB.pdf,https://www.asms.org.nz/about-asms/,https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e332a62c703f653182faf47/5e332a62c703f622242fcfe2_Bagshaw%20FINAL.pdf,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/national-population-estimates-at-31-march-2020-infoshare-tables#:~:text=At%2031%20March%202020%3A,36.2%20and%2038.5%20years%2C%20respectively.,https://www.asms.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/12671-Hospitals-on-the-Edge-WEB.pdf,https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/hospital-site-could-be-cleared-june,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-confirms-new-dunedin-hospital-design,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/431044/christchurch-hospital-waipapa-opens-after-two-years-of-delays,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/122280631/new-west-coast-hospital-opens-after-long-delay-and-budget-blowout,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/122017066/dhb-overspends-now-a-feature-of-the-system--auditorgeneral,https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/key-health-sector-organisations-and-people/district-health-boards/accountability-and-funding/summary-financial-reports/dhb-sector-financial-reports-2019-2020,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/400523/dhbs-owe-health-workers-up-to-650m-for-holidays-act-errors","Are 500,000 people waiting for hospital care in New Zealand?",,,,,,
67,,,,False,,2020-11-20,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/tall-tale-of-women-begging-for-forgiveness-is-a-christmas-cracker/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims that women used to apologise to their husbands at Christmas for their mistakes and ask for forgiveness in an apparently forgotten tradition.The post, from November 8, includes a meme that states: “At Christmas women used to apologize (sic) to their husbands for all the mistakes they made during the year and beg for forgiveness. Let’s not let this beautiful custom get lost.”The meme text is above a black-and-white image showing five women kneeling, many with their hands clasped together, in front of five men dressed in suits.It was posted by a New Zealand-based account and at the time of writing it had been shared more than 70 times, attracting more than 30 comments and 25 reactions. Other versions of the same meme have received thousands of shares (see examples here, here and here). A post claims that women used to apologise to their husbands in a long-lost Christmas tradition. The AnalysisThe image in the post has appeared on the internet for several years accompanied by a variety of captions – none of which are able to be verified – but AAP FactCheck could find no credible source to corroborate the existence of the purported Christmas tradition.A reverse image search reveals the same image included in the meme has been posted widely online since 2014, including on several Russian-based websites.The earliest use of the image AAP FactCheck identified was from May 2, 2014, when the photo was headed as an “interesting party” on a blog and captioned as a “weird photo of a bunch of women being submissive” on photo-sharing site Flickr.One Russian website included the photo in a post from 2015 with a caption that translates to: “Ladies invite gentlemen to the White Dance, 1900.” A “white dance” has been described as a tradition in Russia and other European countries where women invite men to dance (see here and here).A Google search reveals the same description in Russian appears more than 700 times online, and the photo and caption have been posted on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.However, AAP FactCheck was unable to find any reputable source that confirmed that the photo was of Russian origin and showed women asking men to a white dance.A Spanish-language blog from 2017 claims the image shows a Mexican tradition from the Porfiriato period (1877-80 and 1884-1911) when “a strange and humiliating ritual spread among the wealthy classes: at the end of the year the woman knelt in front of her husband and asked forgiveness for the mistakes made throughout the year”.Similar claims were made in Spanish-language posts on Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter, while an English-language blog post claims the image is from 1876.University of Wisconsin history professor Victor Macias-Gonzalez, an expert on gender and class in Mexican history and a specialist on the Porfiriato period, said he had never heard of the tradition.“I have been reading and writing about this for 25 years and have never seen a reference to this,” Prof Macias-Gonzalez told AAP FactCheck via email.“I suspect there was a postcard that was created at some point and misinformation has grown out of it.”The photo is available to buy as a postcard on one website under the description, “Vintage Victorian Women Kneel Before their Husband Postcard.”University of Houston history professor John Mason Hart, an expert on Mexican history, said the claim in the post “sounds like malarky”, although he added it could be linked to a religious sect.University of Chicago history professor Maurico Tenorio, who has written extensively on Mexican history in the 19th and 20th centuries, said he had never come across this tradition.“Maybe some people did it, but that the gesture was a tradition, I never found such a thing in the many newspapers, novels, documents and memoirs I have read,” Prof Tenorio told AAP FactCheck via email.“Maybe some religious group did so, maybe some families, but it was not a ‘tradition’.”The image has also appeared on Chinese-language websites with a caption that translates as: “In London, England in 1892, 5 women kneeled in front of some men, showing a relationship of pursuit and attachment” (see examples here, here and here).The earliest instance AAP FactCheck found of the photo being used with text similar to that in the Facebook post appeared in 2018. The following year the image and text appeared on meme websites awwwmemes.com and memedroid.com.Other versions of the post claim the tradition was from 1918 without presenting any supporting evidence (see examples here and here).Macquarie University history professor Bronwen Neil, who has written about the origins of Christmas traditions, said the “tradition” in the Facebook post was fictional.“You can’t rule out that it happened in some puritanical sect, but I’ve never heard of it and it’s definitely not mainstream,” Prof Neil said via email.American author Ace Collins, who has written multiple books on Christmas traditions including Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas, said he had never heard of the tradition mentioned in the post.“I’ve studied traditions for almost two decades and that is a new one to me,” Mr Collins told AAP FactCheck in an email. “I’ve never heard it.”University of Otago history professor Barbara Brookes, an expert on women’s history, said she had never heard of the tradition, adding: “This seems made up to me.”University of Otago history teaching fellow Dr Violeta Gilabert wrote her thesis on the history of marriage in New Zealand and also said she had never come across the tradition.“You’d think that if the tradition existed that I would have come across it,” she said during a phone interview.Similar posts have been fact-checked as false (here, here and here). Many traditions surround Christmas – but women begging for forgiveness isn’t one of them.","https://archive.vn/UMchO,https://www.facebook.com/983486471694463/posts/2749636221746137,https://www.facebook.com/1693165154231456/posts/2518895508325079,https://www.facebook.com/474385552582983/posts/2886115751409939,https://tineye.com/search/118eb2d7434c6c5d3278ce5ddb3c0a6cea068ba0?sort=crawl_date&order=asc&page=1,http://dreamslikethat.blogspot.com/2014/05/an-interesting-party.html,https://www.flickr.com/photos/110347036@N05/13903368689/,https://pikabu.ru/story/damyi_priglashayut_kavalerov_na_belyiy_tanets_1900_g_3238216,https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=1_hLXn6CbewC&q=%22white+dance%22#v=snippet&q=%22white%20dance%22&f=false,https://translate.google.com/translate?newwindow=1&uact=5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob&sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftancor.info%2Fo-tancah%2Fbelyj-tanec-etiket-stoletnej-davnosti%2F,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02k1nEWGcbEGXDk6EKVszWKmW8JuA%3A1605664071349&ei=R320X7_qFPCf4-EP9biZ4Ao&q=%22%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8B+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82+%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%B9+%D0%A2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%2C+1900+%D0%B3.%22&oq=%22%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8B+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82+%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%B9+%D0%A2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%2C+1900+%D0%B3.%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQoAEQiwMyCAghEKABEIsDMggIIRCgARCLAzIICCEQoAEQiwMyCAghEKABEIsDOgQIIxAnOgcIIxDqAhAnUNCfA1jhsQNgs7YDaAFwAHgAgAHjCIgB7yySAQk0LTEuMS40LjGYAQCgAQGgAQKqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEKuAEDwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwj_qefk_IrtAhXwzzgGHXVcBqwQ4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/473370610835385112/,https://www.facebook.com/pojiznib/photos/%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86-1900-%D0%B3/2225569260868647/,https://twitter.com/katrin_buk/status/571071795614371840?lang=en,https://www.instagram.com/p/B1OIEZllfsS/?hl=en,https://blogs.publico.es/strambotic/2017/12/mujeres-pidiendo-perdon-a-sus-maridos/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Porfiriato,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1393455270860778&id=417705648435750,https://www.pinterest.com.mx/pin/863143084811951602/,https://twitter.com/Sra_Catolica/status/946090214040244224,https://9gag.com/gag/aW1Ejnq,https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/vmacias-gonzalez/,https://www.zazzle.com/vintage_victorian_women_kneel_before_their_husband_postcard-239881238599850592,https://www.uh.edu/class/history/faculty-and-staff/hart_j/,https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/mauricio-tenorio,https://www.xuehua.us/a/5ec1fac4b0af2733fb73f0be,https://kknews.cc/zh-sg/history/3v5lme3.html,https://kuaibao.qq.com/s/20190716AZOZSP00?refer=spider,https://9gag.com/gag/abYZDAE,https://awwmemes.com/i/3e5b4b13fa6b4ea0a494a53d2ecbd636,https://www.memedroid.com/memes/detail/2815663/apologize?refGallery=tags&page=3&tag=Women,https://www.reddit.com/r/AreTheStraightsOK/comments/i8fr89/_/,https://archive.is/wDV9E,https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/bronwen-neil,https://theconversation.com/how-did-we-come-to-celebrate-christmas-66042,https://www.acecollins.com/,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5323.Stories_Behind_the_Great_Traditions_of_Christmas,https://www.otago.ac.nz/history/staff/otago031116.html,https://www.otago.ac.nz/history/staff/otago730361.html,https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/10037,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/11/facebook-posts/no-evidence-old-christmas-tradition-had-women-begg/,https://www.truthorfiction.com/christmas-tradition-of-women-begging-their-husbands-for-forgiveness/,https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-evidence-photo-shows-women-begging-husbands-for-forgiveness-in-forgotten-tradition/",Tall

68,,,,Partly False –,,2020-11-19,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/can-australians-be-locked-up-for-refusing-a-covid-19-vaccine/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA comment on the British Medical Journal (BMJ) website claiming people who refuse a future COVID-19 vaccine could face prison terms and hefty fines has been widely shared online.A Facebook post from The Natural Nutritionist page includes a meme with text that mirrors the first line of the comment: “Five years imprisonment and/or a $66,600 fine for refusing coronavirus vaccination?”.The post text then duplicates the BMJ comment in full, including a claim that “under the Australian Biosecurity Act 2015, refusers of coronavirus vaccination in Australia could be at risk of five years imprisonment and/or a $66,600 fine”.“This emergency power has been active since March 2020, and has been extended to December 2020, with the potential for unlimited extensions,” it says.“It’s possible this emergency power could be extended until a coronavirus vaccine is available, and that people in Australia could be under duress to have coronavirus vaccination, i.e. at risk of imprisonment and/or a huge fine, for a virus which is not a threat to most people under 70.”The end of the post includes the additional lines: “When will the remaining experts with a conscious (sic) raise their concerns over this? Coerced vaccination is illegal.”At the time of writing, the November 3 post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and shared more than 170 times, attracting over 240 reactions and 190 comments.The BMJ comment has also been shared by other social media users in Australia and New Zealand (see examples here and here). A Facebook post suggests people refusing COVID-19 vaccinations could be jailed or fined. The AnalysisWhile it is possible for authorities to issue control orders to specific individuals to get vaccinated, the federal government can’t use the Biosecurity Act to make vaccines mandatory across the broad population, two legal experts told AAP FactCheck.The Australian government has also said a COVID-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory, and that emergency powers granted under the Act were not intended for the enforcement of national immunisation programs.With multiple potential vaccines in development to combat the virus, Australia has entered into agreements to secure access to at least four different vaccine candidates and more than 134 million potential doses, according to a government press release from November 5.However, concerns have also been raised about people being forced or coerced into taking the vaccine.Prime Minister Scott Morrison initially said in August he expected the vaccine to be made “as mandatory as you could possibly make it”, and the only exemptions should be on medical grounds.But later on the same day he stepped back from the comments, saying there would be “no compulsory vaccine but there will be a lot of encouragement and measures to get as high a rate of acceptance” as possible.Following a National Cabinet meeting of state and territory leaders on November 13, Mr Morrison reiterated that a COVID-19 vaccine would be strongly encouraged but not mandatory.The claim in the Facebook posts repeats a BMJ comment in response to an article from the journal’s editor, Fiona Godlee, that questioned the value of a hastily developed COVID-19 vaccine.The source of the comment, which suggests COVID-19 vaccination could be enforced under the Biosecurity Act, is listed as an “independent person investigating the over-use of vaccine products and conflicts of interest in vaccination policy” from Adelaide.The Biosecurity Act came into effect in 2015 and lays out Australia’s plan to protect itself from biosecurity threats like pests and diseases that can affect plants, animals or humans.Associate professor Patrick Emerton, a legal theorist from Monash University in Melbourne, said the post’s hypothesis – that “refusers of coronavirus vaccination” could be at risk of imprisonment or fines – was “simplistic” and failed to unpack the “conditionalities” of the Act.“There are two pathways under the Act for vaccine requirements. It can be made an entry condition, which is already similar to how yellow fever works in Australia, and a lot of other countries, and it could also be made a condition under a control order, which could be issued against an individual who has been found to have symptoms or have been exposed,” he told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview.“That control order could include a requirement to be vaccinated. There’s no process for exercising force to impose the vaccination, but if you refuse to be vaccinated, then you’ve committed an offence … which could result in a fine or imprisonment as punishment.”Dr Emerton added that these measures were unlikely to be used “aggressively” due to a lack of popular support.Paula O’Brien, director of the Health Law and Ethics Network at Melbourne Law School, told AAP FactCheck in an email there were “serious restrictions” on the scope of human biosecurity control orders (HBCOs) under the Act.An order could state, for example, that an individual receives, at a specified medical facility, a specified vaccination, she said.Restrictions under the Act include: the HBCO can only be used on certain high-risk individuals (section 60(2)); the order must be a matter of last resort under strict principles (section 34); force cannot be used to require compliance (section 95); and the procedure must be carried out in a manner consistent with appropriate medical and professional standards (section 94).“There is only a risk of penalty if a HCBO and a biosecurity measure is in place requiring vaccination … and it is simply not possible to imagine the government making millions of these orders to get the population to vaccinate against COVID,” Dr O’Brien said.“These are not general laws which apply to all of us but such an order could be made against an individual if all of the requirements set out were met.”Dr O’Brien said there were also rights for an order to be reviewed in court. However, anyone breaching an order could be imprisoned for up to five years or fined 300 penalty units, which currently equates to $66,600.She said it was “very unlikely at this stage” that the Commonwealth would use this provision to enforce the use of a COVID-19 vaccine for specific individuals.Dr O’Brien added that, generally, if the government wanted to do something “very intrusive of individual rights and freedoms”, it would need to pass fresh laws through parliament in order to do so rather than rely on delegated authorities under existing public health laws.“I have little doubt that, if a direction for vaccination by all people in Victoria were made by the CHO (chief health officer) under section 200 (of Victoria’s Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008) and if it were challenged in the courts, the courts would say it was unlawful for such a requirement to be imposed on the population under delegated legislation,” she said.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told AAP FactCheck vaccinations were not mandatory in Australia, and individuals would maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate.“This right will extend to any COVID-19 vaccination that may become available,” she said.The spokeswoman said emergency powers under the Biosecurity Act were intended to be time-limited, and they would be removed when the public health evidence supported doing so.“It is not the intention of the human biosecurity emergency power to enforce national vaccination campaigns,” she said. Experts say it’s “very unlikely” people will be jailed or fined for refusing COVID-19 vaccines.","https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3258/rr-17 ,https://archive.vn/mqFoA,https://www.facebook.com/josefa.savu/posts/10164741604850122,https://www.facebook.com/104464501397663/posts/143248024185977,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/australia-secures-a-further-50-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-20/coronavirus-vaccine-mandatory-rules-anti-vaxxers/12575138,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-19/morrison-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-mandatory/12572992,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/19/scott-morrisons-talk-of-mandatory-covid-vaccine-is-dangerous-experts-warn,https://archive.vn/OGZ89,https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3258/rr-17,https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3258,https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/legislation/biosecurity-legislation,https://lens.monash.edu/@patrick-emerton,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-communic-factsheets-yellow.htm#travellers,https://law.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff/paula-obrien ,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2020C00127,https://www.agriculture.gov.au/import/industry-advice/2020/89-2020#:~:text=On%201%20July%202020%2C%20the,a%20penalty%20unit%20is%20maintained.,https://content.legislation.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/08-46aa043%20authorised.pdf",Can Australians be locked up for refusing a COVID-19 vaccine?,,,,,,
69,,,,Missing Context,,2020-11-19,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/worlds-oldest-person-candidate-hasnt-aged-well/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementClaims that Chinese man, Li Ching Yuen, lived for 256 years has reignited social media’s fascination with human longevity.An Instagram post shared by a New Zealand account features two black-and-white pictures under the title, “Did you know?” The text below the title reads, “According to a research (sic) published in the New York Times in 1933 Li Ching Yuen was quite the extraordinary man. As a Chinese herbalist and martial artist, he lived 256 years or, ‘only’ about 200 years by his own account.”The post goes on say that Mr Li credited his longevity to “Qi-Dong, meditation and a diet containing herbs like Reishi medicinal mushroom, shilajit and sea vegetables”.A caption includes additional information on Mr Li, claiming he was “born in 1736 in Sichuan, China” and died on “May 6, 1933, 256 (sic) years later” and that the “Imperial Chinese Government had congratulated him on his 150th and 200th birthday”.At the time of writing, the November 3 post had been viewed more than 2000 times and attracted more than 90 likes.Variations of the post have previously been shared on Facebook with one post from 2013 recording more than 53,000 shares. An Instagram post claims that Chinese man Li Ching Yuen lived for 256 years. The AnalysisThe extraordinary tale of Li Ching Yuen’s supposed longevity is well documented, but experts told AAP FactCheck that there is no verifiable evidence to support the claim that he lived for 256 years – nor was this alleged life span plausible.As of 2020, the oldest person whose age has been verified is Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who lived for 122 years and 164 days.Mr Li’s death was recorded in The New York Times in 1933 following a report by the Associated Press. The story’s headline, “Li Ching-Yun Dead; Gave His Age as 197” is augmented by a sub-head that reads, “Inquiry putting his age at 256.”The news report goes on to say that Mr Li was reported to have buried 23 wives during his long life. It drew on tales from his native province to support the longevity claim, as well as a purported study from a Chinese academic that was also referenced in a 1929 Time article.However, the New York Times article casts doubt on Mr Li’s claims in the final paragraph, which reads: “One statement of THE TIMES correspondent which probably caused (sceptical) readers to believe Li was born more recently than 1677, was that ‘many who have seen him recently declare that his facial appearance is no different from that of persons two centuries his junior’.”Dr Thomas Perls, an expert in the genetics of ageing and exceptional longevity from Boston University, told AAP FactCheck in an email that claims of people living for more than 200 years are “all false”.“Just from a demographic point of view, a claim of 256 is impossible,” he said.Dr Perls pointed to a study he co-authored titled, “Typologies of Extreme Longevity Myths”, which investigated the “various causes of false claims of extraordinary longevity”.The paper compared supercentenarian cases, people who lived for more than 110 years, generated from the US Social Security Death Index, to a validated list by the Gerontology Research Group.“One observes that the rate of (age) validation declines with age, from about 35 per cent at age 110-111 to just two per cent by age 115 and zero per cent for 120+ years,” the paper stated.In the case of Mr Li, the paper said his claim of longevity was related to the category of spiritual practice which “asserts that certain philosophies or religious practices allow a person to live to extreme old age”.“Not only was his age claim fantastical, and the number chosen as a multiple of eight (considered good luck in China), but the rationale was that he lived so long due to his following a certain practice or way of life,” the paper said.Dr Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said the average life span at the time Mr Li was alive was around 35 years.“Efforts by the World Health Organization to confirm the age of death of supposedly long-lived people (>150) around the world have failed. Some motivations (for these claims) were adopting grandparents’ identities to avoid army services, amongst other things,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.Dr Barzilai conceded that lifestyle practices in Mr Li’s era could increase the chances of a person living until they’re 80, about the average age of death today, but not to hundreds of years.“I doubt there is a chance that this ever happened and probably will not happen in our lifetime,” he said.When it comes to verifying extreme longevity cases, Dr Dmitri Jdanov from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany told AAP FactCheck: “We need to trace the whole life of the person – early life documents like (their) birth certificate, census records, marriage certificate. As I understand, it is impossible for Li Ching Yuen.”However, Dr Jdanov was open to the possibility that one day humans may achieve extreme longevity.“There is no evidence (at the moment) that humans may live longer. But there is also no strong evidence that it is impossible,” he said.An Italian study looking into human longevity found, in a sample of more than 4000 supercentenarians, the risk of mortality plateaus once people reach an age of 105.The study concluded that once a person reaches this age, they have an almost 50 per cent chance of surviving from one year to the next. An Italian study found that mortality risk plateaus once people reach the age of 105.","https://archive.vn/OSbL8,https://archive.vn/KguCk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928146/,https://www.nytimes.com/1933/05/06/archives/li-chingyun-dead-gayehisageas197-keep-quiet-heart-sit-like-a.html,http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,752163,00.html,https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/thomas-perls/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062986/,https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/supercentenarian,https://grg.org/,https://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/484/nir-barzilai/,https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/about_us_6113/staff_directory_1899/dmitri_a_jdanov_516,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1459",World’s oldest person candidate hasn’t aged well,,,,,,

This example has since been shared more than 143,000 times, however it includes no reference to the actor.A week later, the same wording appeared in a meme that included Carrey’s face and his name next to the comments, which were surrounded in quote marks. This version has been shared more than 1000 times in the case of one post, while it has since been recreated and shared in numerous other posts (including here and here).None of the memes included information about where or when Carrey made the purported remarks.In an email to AAP FactCheck, Carrey’s publicist, Marleah Leslie, said he did not make the statement.“The quote you are referring to was not made by my client Jim Carrey,” she said.Wording used in the quote does not appear on Carrey’s Twitter feed, nor does it appear from legitimate sources in Google searches.A search through archives of Carrey’s Twitter account, his only official social media profile, also show no sign of any later-deleted comments that match the quote from the period between the outbreak of COVID-19 and March 10, when the meme appeared.Carrey did not post about the pandemic during this period. His first tweet relating to COVID-19 was posted on March 25 and it criticises US President Donald Trump’s handling of the health crisis.In public statements, Carrey has expressed his concern about the virus and has called for more action to be taken to reduce the death toll, at odds with the purported quote.He has created multiple artworks and cartoons criticising President Trump’s handling of the pandemic (here, here, here) and has repeatedly tweeted his concerns about the mounting death toll of COVID-19 in the US (here, here and here).In an opinion piece published in The Atlantic in September, Carrey criticised Mr Trump and the Republican Party for not listening to scientists during the pandemic.The actor has previously attracted controversy for his opposition to a California law change which reduced exemptions to childhood vaccinations.At the time, he claimed that children could be poisoned by mercury and aluminium in the vaccines, referred to the Californian administration as “fascist and labelled the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as corrupt. His comments were criticised as not understanding the science behind vaccines.Carrey later stated he was “pro-vaccine” but “anti-neurotoxin”. The actor has previously been falsely credited with a comment stating that America was “morally upside down”, according to a 2018 Snopes fact check. Actor Jim Carrey has been critical of President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://archive.vn/9sFfu,https://www.facebook.com/elizabethjohnstonministries/photos/a.954653337986149/3390768384374620,https://elizabethjohnston.org/about/,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jim-Carrey,https://www.facebook.com/yash.sharma.9404/posts/10216352300586969,https://www.facebook.com/747419318721729/posts/1808577362605914,https://www.facebook.com/269494609918542/posts/1611352592399397,https://www.facebook.com/954553357996147/posts/3390768384374620,https://www.marleahleslie.com/clients,https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40JimCarrey%20world%20manipulated&src=typed_query&f=live,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk0066aXyQXgl78fKHMQv8wtt1q4mlg%3A1605237427241&ei=s_qtX_-eDpDl9QPlm73QCA&q=Jim+Carrey+%E2%80%9CThe+virus+has+proved+that+the+entire+world+can+be+easily+manipulated%22&oq=Jim+Carrey+%E2%80%9CThe+virus+has+proved+that+the+entire+world+can+be+easily+manipulated%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DhR1jhR2DxSmgAcAB4AIAB8AGIAfABkgEDMi0xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi_xIW1x_7sAhWQcn0KHeVND4oQ4dUDCA0&uact=5,https://web.archive.org/web/20200315080000/https://twitter.com/JimCarrey,https://archive.is/GeQlY,https://archive.is/9zQs1,https://archive.is/ShN9d,https://archive.is/fw5sP,https://twitter.com/JimCarrey/status/1297606666909700096,https://twitter.com/JimCarrey/status/1303945053203656704,https://twitter.com/JimCarrey/status/1297624675120365568,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/jim-carrey-truth-justice-and-world-without-trump/615964/,https://theconversation.com/dumb-or-dumber-jim-carreys-anti-vax-antics-expose-the-tactics-of-internet-cranks-44236,https://twitter.com/JimCarrey/status/616051925859987456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E616051925859987456%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedcitynews.com%2F2015%2F07%2Fjim-carrey-is-adamantly-insisting-he-is-not-actually-anti-vaccine-despite-his-very-public-opposition-to-californias-new-law%2F,https://archive.is/RU2Eg,https://archive.is/OjWFI,https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/jim-carrey-vaccination-tweet_n_7708106,https://archive.is/qYA7m,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jim-carrey-america-upside-down/",Fake Jim Carrey COVID-19 quote is no laughing matter,,,,,,
71,,,,Satire,,2020-11-17,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/pope-post-is-a-hoax-of-biblical-proportions/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post claims Pope Francis has cancelled the Bible and proposed a new book to take its place.The post features a photo of Pope Francis and a screenshot of an article from April 2018, which is headlined: “Pope Francis cancels The Bible and proposes to create a new book.”The article, dated April 2, 2018, reads, “Pope Francis has surprised the world today by announcing that The Bible is totally outdated and needs radical change, so The Bible is officially canceled and it’s announced a meeting between the highest personalities of the church where it will be decided the book that will be replace it, its name and its content.”Above the article is a caption which reads, “dear friends the time is near/repent while you still can/2 THESSALONIANS 2:3.. let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition…”The post was shared by a Facebook user in Fiji to the public group Adventist Living, which is described as “dedicated to Seventh-Day Adventist living to spread the gospel and the good news through the principles taught in the Bible”. The group has more than 69,000 members.Some of the comments on the post call out the claims as false, while others criticise the Pope for his purported action.At the time of publication, the November 5 post had been shared more than 140 times and drawn more than 120 comments, 180 interactions and 24,000 views. A post claims Pope Francis has cancelled the Bible and proposed a new book to take its place. The AnalysisSince becoming pope in 2013, Francis has embarked on a reform agenda within the Vatican and more widely the Catholic Church, drawing criticism from conservative church figures for his stance on issues such as same-sex civil unions.Reformist intentions aside, cancelling the Bible and replacing it with a new book is not part of his plans.The source of the post’s article, Thereisnews.com, describes itself on its legal disclaimer page as “a humor site whose purpose is entertainment”, adding: “The content of TIN is fiction and does not correspond to reality.”Under its header, including on the page that hosts the article about the Pope, the site carries the tagline, “Not real, but so funny.”The post dates back to at least 2018 and has previously been debunked as satirical here, here, here, here and here.Far from cancelling the Bible, Pope Francis continues to quote from the religious text in his homilies. For example, the Pope’s November 15 homily includes at least seven direct biblical references.The caption introducing the post’s article are from the New Testament book 2 Thessalonians 2.3, echoing what is known as “end times theology”, or the belief in a series of events and signs that herald the end of the world and the return of Jesus Christ to liberate his followers.Dr Scott Kirkland, lecturer in practical theology and ethics at Trinity College, University of Melbourne, said the post’s article is a “fake story”.“The Pope hasn’t declared that the Bible needs to be replaced,” he told AAP FactCheck.“Francis has actually been quite self-conscious of using the Bible in order to make a case for several important developments in Catholic theology and teaching, not least concerning the environment.”Dr Kirkland said the post plays on anxieties about the papacy, and it appeals to an Adventist school of belief in which the antichrist is an important precursor to Christ’s return.“This article, which is written as satire, is interpreted through this theological lens as both a sign of something terrible – the antichrist – but also as something for them strangely hopeful,” he said.Reverend Dr Kevin Waldie, a biblical studies lecturer at the Catholic Good Shepherd College in Auckland, said the post completely misrepresents the Pope’s public stance on the authority of the Bible.“Anyone familiar with the documentation that Pope Francis has been issuing in recent times would see that quite clearly his thinking is based on the biblical text itself,” Dr Waldie told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview.He said the post had more to do with something deep-seated in evangelical fundamentalism’s view of Catholicism.“There’s something there that lacks respect, possibly, for the tradition that is witnessed through the spoken word of Pope Francis and through the documentation.” Pope Francis continues to quote from the Bible during his homilies.","http://archive.vn/zpGPh,https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmazingFactsPresents/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmazingFactsPresents/about,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francis-I-pope,https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-francis-plan-reform-convert-church,https://apnews.com/article/relationships-rhode-island-civil-unions-providence-pope-francis-a2326069ab177719eba12a41d8019046,https://thereisnews.com/legal-warning/,https://thereisnews.com/pope-francis-cancels-bible/,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/265981603/fake-news--no-pope-francis-is-not-cancelling-the-bible,https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/fake-news-no-pope-francis-is-not-cancelling-the-bible-20200803,https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-pope-francis-not-cancelling-bible/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/apr/11/everyday-devotional/its-fake-news-pope-cancelled-bible/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-pope-francis-cancel-the-bible/,http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2020.index.html,http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2020/documents/papa-francesco_20201115_omelia-giornatamondiale-poveri.html,https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/KJV/2Thess/2/3/,https://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/theological-school/faculty-and-staff/scott-kirkland,https://www.gsc.ac.nz/about-gsc/our-people/kevin-waldie/",Pope post is a hoax of biblical proportions,,,,,,
72,,,,False,,2020-11-16,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/new-zealands-new-food-bill-doesnt-ban-gardening/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA post widely shared on Facebook claims a new food bill in New Zealand “takes away (the) human right to grow food”.The blog post, dated October 29, begins by stating: “I was shocked to learn from a friend on the weekend that a new Food Bill is being brought in here in New Zealand. The new bill will make it a privilege and not a right to grow food.”It goes on to say that “the government has created this bill to keep in line with its World Trade Organisation obligations under an international scheme called Codex Alimentarius (“Food Book”)”.The post goes on to list the purported effects of the bill, including making it “illegal to distribute food without authorisation”, controlling the supply of seeds and allowing “police acting as Food Safety Officers” to raid premises without a warrant.According to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media insights tool, the article had been shared more than 240 times at the time of writing.Similar versions of the same claims were also shared direct to Facebook, with one example generating more than 300 shares, while a meme repeating points made in the article had also been shared more than 390 times since it was posted in late October. A meme shared on social media claims a new bill in NZ will “take away human right to grow food”. The AnalysisAlthough the blog post is dated October 29, 2020, and refers to a “New Food Bill”,  the legislation in question was introduced to the New Zealand parliament in May 2010 before passing into law as the Food Act in 2014.At the time of the Food Bill’s first reading in parliament, then Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson said the legislation would overhaul near-30-year-old laws that related to trading in food.It would do this by introducing a series of risk-based measures for businesses, “for example, a baked goods fund-raiser will no longer have the same regulatory requirements that a bakery has”, Ms Wilkinson said.The Bill attracted controversy at the time, with a 2011 Stuff.co.nz article under the headline “Bill sparks garden concerns” quoting an Oamaru community gardener who expressed fears of “big companies wanting sole rights to seeds because they don’t produce seeds and you have to buy them again each year”.However, in a press release from October 2011, Ms Wilkinson criticised “misinformation” surrounding the Bill, noting that “anonymous agitators” had been spreading “false information on the internet” about the legislation.“Small growers who share or trade their produce with neighbours or who sell direct to consumers have nothing to fear from the new Food Bill,” she said in the press release.“They will not face costs of any kind, or require to be registered or verified. At most, they will be supplied with free educational pamphlets which provide basic tips on how to handle food safely.”The minister told Stuff in October 2011: “Unfortunately a small minority have decided the Bill is some sort of global corporate conspiracy designed to take control of the food chain and will lead to armed police storming the homes of private gardeners. Obviously this is rubbish.”Neither the earlier draft versions of the Food Bill nor the Food Act include any references to restricting access to seeds, with the legislation making it clear any rules relating to nuts and seeds applied only to companies processing the goods for human consumption.The October 29, 2020, post was made to the SGT Report site, which describes itself as the “corporate propaganda antidote” and reproduces articles on topics such as alleged “Deep State” conspiracies.It cited the source as another site, Greed Med Info, which posts articles questioning the existence of COVID-19 alongside posts on various purported natural cures.The latter site’s version of the Food Bill article includes a prominent “correction”, which reads: “The bill and article was published in error as ‘new’. The article is from 2011, and the bill did not pass, although some of the proposed regulations were passed and incorporated into the Food Act of 2014. These did not make gardening illegal. We apologize for this editorial oversight.”The text in the articles appear to have been drawn from a September 2011 post on the Investment Watch blog site.Both the articles and the Facebook posts include fallacious references to the World Trade Organization and the “Codex Alimentarius”.The Codex Alimentarius is “a collection of standards, codes of practice, guidelines and other recommendations relative to food”, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organization.However the international bodies state that the Codex standards are “voluntary in nature”, adding that they would need to be translated into national legislation in order to be enforceable (page 13).None of the Bill’s readings in parliament make mention of the government introducing the new laws in order to meet any international obligations, other than New Zealand’s joint food agreement with Australia.New Zealand’s Ministry of Primary Industries told AAP FactCheck in an email that the claims made in the Facebook meme, which mirrors sections of the articles, were “entirely false and there is no legislation supporting these claims”.A BuzzFeed article in 2016 addressed lingering social media rumours that it was “illegal to grow a garden in New Zealand”. The ministry reiterated that there are “no laws against people in New Zealand having gardens”.“There are no laws against people having gardens, or sharing food that they’ve grown at home. New food safety law (the Food Act 2014) only applies to food for sale, so has no effect on people sharing food,” it said at the time.“The law also allows people sell the food they grow at home, at their farm gate or on a market stall for example, without the need to register under the Food Act.” NZ’s Ministry of Primary Industries told AAP FactCheck the claims about the Food Bill are false.","https://archive.vn/jqW1g,https://archive.vn/ueLu0,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL9974_1/food-bill,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/49HansD_20100722_00000652/food-bill-first-reading,https://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/5640888/Bill-sparks-garden-concerns,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/greens-wrong-food-bill,http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5767084/Political-stoush-over-Food-Bill,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2010/0160/45.0/versions.aspx,https://www.sgtreport.com/2020/11/unelected-officials-override-the-president-to-continue-wars-but-only-kooks-believe-in-the-deep-state/,https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/yet-another-case-missing-virus-they-lied-and-locked-down-world,https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/bayberry-leaf-offers-hope-against-growing-antibiotic-resistance,https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/new-food-bill-in-new-zealand-takes-away-human-right-to-grow-food/,http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5667e.pdf,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL9974_1/tab/hansard,https://www.mpi.govt.nz/,https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/nz-garden-ban",New Zealand’s ‘new’ Food Bill doesn’t ban gardening,,,,,,

In the video, Ms O’Doherty claims SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the disease COVID-19, has never been isolated nor shown to cause the illness – and therefore does not exist.“Ask them (politicians) does SARS-CoV-2 exist, does it cause an illness that matches the characteristics of all of the deaths attributed to COVID-19, has it been isolated, reproduced and then shown to cause this illness? The answer will be no,” she says in the clip.At the time of writing the Instagram post had been viewed more than 15,500 times, attracting more than 90 comments.It was posted by Australian chiropractor Jennifer Barham-Floreani, whose website states she is “an award-winning health practitioner and best selling author“. She has more than 19,000 Instagram followers.Ms Barham-Foreani also posted a full eight-minute video featuring Ms O’Doherty, in which she says her claims are based on a Freedom of Information request to the UK health department which shows “the ministry does not hold any information on the isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus”.“In other words, it does not exist,” Ms O’Doherty concludes.Ms O’Doherty has been campaigning against restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland. She has previously had her YouTube account suspended for hate speech and her Twitter account permanently suspended for breaching policies to prevent abusive behaviour and hateful conduct.At the time of publication the post had been viewed more than 12,400 times, attracting more than 80 comments.The full video has been shared multiple times online to various platforms, including here, here, here and here. An Instagram post and video claim the virus that causes COVID-19 has never been isolated. The AnalysisSince being identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to more than 51 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and over 1.2 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization’s tally from November 12.Research shows the virus was isolated early in the outbreak and has since been isolated many times in multiple countries.An article in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization said researchers first isolated the virus in December 2019, and in February scientists analysed the genome from 10,022 samples to understand its variability.An article published in the journal Nature in February detailed how SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, was isolated by scientists in Wuhan.It said full-length, near-identical genome sequences for the virus were obtained from five patients at an early stage of “an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome” that began in the Chinese city on December 12.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated in its lab and had been available for free to researchers and scientists to study since February.An article in the CDC journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, detailed how US scientists isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient in January.Journal articles also detail how the virus was isolated in Korea and Germany.In Australia, it was isolated from the first person in the country diagnosed with COVID-19, a Wuhan man who was admitted to a Melbourne hospital with fever, cough and laboured breathing.The University of Melbourne explained in January how scientists in the city had been the first to grow the virus in a lab outside China.Pathology professor Karen Mossman, part of the team that isolated the virus in Canada, wrote in an article on The Conversation that isolating the virus required collecting specimens from patients and culturing, or growing, it by getting it to infect live mammalian cells in a lab.A blog post by virologist and adjunct associate professor at the University of Queensland Ian M Mackay also detailed a number of instances where the virus had been isolated around the globe and debunked some of the misconceptions that the virus had not been isolated.The virus had also been successfully isolated from urine and from ocular secretions.University of Auckland associate professor and microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles said the theory that SARS-CoV-2 had not been isolated was spreading based on government information requests worded in ways that misunderstood how the isolation process and viruses worked.In the extended video posted on Instagram, Ms O’Doherty discusses an information request which asked the UK health department for records that showed SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated “from a symptomatic patient of COVID-19 where the sample was not first combined with any other source of genetic material”. (video mark 2min 50secs)Dr Wiles said that was not possible – describing the request as “a problem of definitions”.“Viruses are basically inanimate objects which need a culture to activate in. But the way they are phrasing the requests is that the sample must be completely unadulterated and not be grown in any culture – and you can’t do that,” she told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview.“You can’t isolate a virus without using a cell culture, so by using their definition it hasn’t been isolated. But it has been isolated and cultivated using a cell culture multiple times all around the world.”University of Auckland senior virology lecturer John Taylor told AAP FactCheck that SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated many times using cells to amplify the virus from patient samples and the idea it could represent some kind of contamination originating in the cells was nonsense.“Viruses are obligate parasites, which means that they only grow within a living host cell. So if you have the caveat that you can’t combine the virus with a host cell then you get the answer you want by ignoring the fundamental biology,” he said.University of Auckland vaccinologist and associate professor Helen Petousis-Harris said SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated – and it could even be viewed with a powerful microscope.“We know what it looks like, we’ve got the architecture of it; for example, you can see the spike proteins under a microscope which looks like a halo, or a corona, which is why it’s called a coronavirus.“You can’t grow a virus without a cell culture, it can’t replicate without the cell machinery, but you can recreate the virus from its genome.”University of Otago public health professor Nick Wilson told AAP FactCheck the argument posed by the Instagram post “is approaching the level of arguing about the Earth being flat or not”. SARS-CoV-2 can be seen under an electron microscope after its isolation from numerous sources.","https://archive.vn/dtPgS,https://welladjusted.co/people/#drjen,https://archive.vn/dKb3J,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/date-set-for-o-doherty-and-waters-appeal-over-refused-covid-19-law-challenge-1.4376623,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/youtube-terminates-gemma-o-doherty-s-account-over-breach-of-hate-speech-policy-1.3958500,https://www.thejournal.ie/gemma-odoherty-twitter-5165384-Jul2020/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/282967603146622/permalink/376882537088461,https://www.bitchute.com/video/ERaMnv3UYgga/,https://www.facebook.com/lorraine.phillips.71/posts/10215966878438699,https://www.facebook.com/helen.hartmann.35/posts/10219074537797389,https://covid19.who.int/,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/98/7/20-253591/en/,https://www.who.int/publications/journals/bulletin/,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/bei-resources-repository,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article,https://ophrp.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x,https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2020/212/10/isolation-and-rapid-sharing-2019-novel-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-first-patient,https://about.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2020/january/melbourne-scientists-first-to-grow-and-share-novel-coronavirus,https://fhs.mcmaster.ca/pathology/contact_us/faculty/faculty_bios/mossman.html,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-1495_article,https://theconversation.com/i-study-viruses-how-our-team-isolated-the-new-coronavirus-to-fight-the-global-pandemic-133675,https://virologydownunder.com/sigh-yes-the-covid-virus-is-real/,https://virologydownunder.com/about-me/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340981118_Isolation_of_infectious_SARS-CoV-2_from_urine_of_a_COVID-19_patient,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175424/,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-wiles,https://archive.vn/dKb3J,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/ja-taylor,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/hpet002,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024455.html",‘Proof’ the virus behind COVID-19 doesn’t exist fails basic biology test,,,,,,
74,,,,Missing Context,,2020-11-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/is-5g-exposure-like-living-in-an-airport-scanner/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAn Instagram post claims Australia has some of the least protective standards for electromagnetic radiation in the world, and compares the radiation from 5G mobile networks to living in an airport security scanner.The post includes a photo of a woman holding a sign which says, “Do you want to live in an airport scanner 24/7?”The text adds that the 26GHz radio spectrum is going to be auctioned off to 5G network providers next year before it goes on to claim that Australia’s radiation standards are lax.“ARPANSA the regulatory body in charge of ‘safety’ for the exposure of electromagnetic radiation have some of the LEAST PROTECTIVE STANDARDS IN THE WORLD,” the post says.“ARPANSA compare 5G exposure to an airport scanner. Who in the their right mind wants to be bathed in one 24/7?!”At the time of publication the October 31 post, from an anti-5G Instagram account, had more than 350 reactions and had been viewed at least 6700 times. A post claims Australia has some of the world’s weakest standards for electromagnetic radiation. The AnalysisThe latest iteration of mobile technology, so-called fifth-generation or 5G, is in the process of being rolled out across Australia.The technology has been live since 2018, with Telstra, Optus and Vodafone all building transmission sites in the major cities. Telstra says its network already reaches more than 41 per cent of the population, to rise to 75 per cent by mid-2021.Current networks operate in the 3.4-3.7 gigahertz (GHz) frequency band, slightly above the spectrum used by 4G. However, the Australian Communications and Media Authority says it plans to auction licences for the 26 GHz spectrum for 5G in April 2021.In an attempt to explain that using these higher frequencies is safe and not new, Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) assistant director of assessment and advice Ken Karipidis has compared 5G to airport scanners in multiple press releases (here and here).“In our community today, there are a range of devices and applications that utilise higher frequencies, for example security screening units at airports, police radar guns to check speed, remote sensors and in medicine,” Dr Karipidis said in one example.So is the radiation from 5G like living inside an airport scanner, as the post claims?There are two main types of airport security scanners commonly in use. One is the backscatter X-ray scanner, which relies on low-dose X-rays similar to those used in medical imaging, according to an article in the Archive of Internal Medicine.These scanners emit low doses of ionising radiation, which had been linked to cell damage and cancer in higher doses, the article said. These scanners are no longer used in the US, Europe, Australia or New Zealand.The other type of scanner uses millimetre waves operating within a similar spectrum to that proposed for 5G. These scanners emit non-ionising radiation, which hadn’t been linked to cell damage or cancer, at a “small fraction of the energy of a cell phone”, the article said.The Australian government says radiation from the machines was “thousands of times lower than that of a single phone call and comparable to passive exposure to a mobile phone used several metres away”, while US authorities provide similar guidance.A 2017 consensus report from the US-based National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found the maximum radiation exposure during testing of several airport millimetre wave scanners was 0.00003 watts per square meter (W/m2) at a distance of 60cm, where a person usually stood during a scan. It said this was 320,000 times lower than the US government’s guideline of 10 W/m2.This level is a fraction of the measured radiation from 5G transmitters. A report by UK communications regulator Ofcom measured radiation at 22 sites around Britain, including at 5G base stations, and found the highest detected level of radiation was 1.5 per cent of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP) guidelines of 10 W/m2. The tested networks operated on frequencies up to 4.2 GHz.The NZ Ministry of Health says measurements at laboratory and operational 5G sites in Australia had shown that radiation from 5G signals was similar to, or lower than, those from existing cell phone sites, and a small fraction of the exposure standards (page 2).ICNIRP also says “initial measurement studies suggest that exposure from 5G antennas will be approximately similar to that from 3G and 4G antennas”.ICNIRP chair Rodney Croft, who is a professor of health psychology at the University of Wollongong, told AAP FactCheck via email there were similarities between millimetre wave airport scanners and 5G as both emitted low levels of radiation which did not penetrate deeply into the body.“The scanners are well-within the ICNIRP restriction levels, and recent research shows that 5G exposure levels are within the range of 100 to 1000 times lower than the restriction levels,” Dr Croft said.“Importantly, in both cases they must operate within the ARPANSA restrictions, and so neither will cause any harm.”Dr Karipidis told AAP FactCheck during a phone interview that it was difficult to accurately compare the level of radiation from 5G and an airport security scanner as it depended on the proximity to the source of radiation.“But the general point is all of these exposures are much lower than the Australian or the international guidelines,” he said.“The radiation from a millimetre scanner is also non-ionising which means it doesn’t accumulate. So as long as it is below the safety standard you, could stand in an airport scanner 24/7 and have no health affect.”The other claim in the post is that ARPANSA’s electromagnetic radiation standards are among the least protective in the world.ARPANSA says its exposure limits are “aligned with international guidelines prepared by ICNIRP and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO)”.GSMA, an industry association representing global mobile operators, says 152 countries use the ICNIRP limits.A 2018 report by the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment compared international policies on electromagnetic radiation. It found Australia’s policies on the exposure of radiofrequency fields for the general public were identical to EU recommendations (page 11).A table comparing exposure limits between selected countries showed China, India, Russia and several European countries had stricter radiation limits than Australia for transmission at certain frequencies (table 1, page 15).A literature survey which looked at regulations and health effects of millimetre-wave frequencies said exposure limits in Russia, China, Switzerland and Italy were two orders of magnitude lower than the ICNIRP standards used by Australia.It also said the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standards were stricter than the ICNIRP standards at some frequencies (see figure 1).ARPANSA says some countries have lower permitted radiation levels than Australia but “these limits are not based on substantiated scientific evidence”.Dr Croft said the ICNIRP standards used by ARPANSA were best practice and the most widely used in the world.“There are some countries that have lower restrictions, but these are not science-based,” he said.“For instance, India simply reduced the ICNIRP restriction values by an arbitrary factor of 10 and used those lower values as their restrictions. However, although lower, India’s restrictions do not provide additional benefit to health.”Nevertheless, Mary Redmayne, a Monash University adjunct research fellow with expertise in radio frequency radiation and its health effects, said the ICNIRP standards could be considered among the least protective in the world because few countries had lower standards and a number of countries used stricter provisions.“More than half the world’s population is under more stringent standards than Australia’s,” she told AAP FactCheck. Airport scanners emit radiation at levels lower than that from a mobile phone.","https://archive.vn/c0rej,https://exchange.telstra.com.au/weve-enabled-5g-in-all-major-australian-cities/,https://www.telstra.com.au/5g#:~:text=Our%205G%20now%20covers%20an,selected%20areas%20on%20selected%20plans.,https://www.optus.com.au/yesbusiness/article/5G-2020-in-Australia,https://www.vodafone.com.au/support/network/5g,https://www.communications.gov.au/departmental-news/instalment-payments-26-ghz-spectrum-support-5g,https://www.whistleout.com.au/MobilePhones/Guides/Will-my-phone-work-in-Australia-carrier-network-frequencies,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-new-generation-mobile-phone-network-and-health,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/misinformation-about-australias-5g-network,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/radiation-sources/more-radiation-sources/airport-passenger-screening#x-ray-backscatter-technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936792/,https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/airport_scan.htm,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_11_1343,https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/what-we-do/travelsecure/passenger-screening,https://www.aviation.govt.nz/passenger-information/what-to-expect-at-the-airport/learn-about-body-scanners/,http://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/radiation-sources/more-radiation-sources/airport-passenger-screening,https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/travelsecure-subsite/files/body-scanner-millimetre-wave-technology-info-sheet.pdf,https://www.epa.gov/radtown/radiation-and-airport-security-scanning,https://www.nap.edu/read/24936/chapter/2#3,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/190005/emf-test-summary.pdf,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/what-is-ofcom,https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/topic_sheets/5g-and-health-aug19.pdf,https://www.icnirp.org/en/applications/5g/index.html,https://www.icnirp.org/en/about-icnirp/commission/details/chair.html,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/regulation-and-licensing/regulatory-publications/radiation-protection-series/codes-and-standards-1,https://www.gsma.com/,https://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/emf-and-health/emf-policy,https://www.rivm.nl/sites/default/files/2018-11/Comparison%20of%20international%20policies%20on%20electromagnetic%20fields%202018.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629874/,https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/regulation-and-licensing/regulatory-publications/radiation-protection-series/codes-and-standards-1,https://www.scimex.org/experts?name=mary-redmayne&a=111419",Is 5G exposure like living in an airport scanner?,,,,,,
75,,,,False,,2020-11-11,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-the-australian-government-isnt-a-privately-owned-us-company/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA number of social media posts claim the Australian government is keeping a secret that it’s “privately owned American company”.One Facebook post is headed, “AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS REGISTERED AS A PRIVATELY OWNED AMERICAN COMPANY”.The post reads, “Is it a secret? I got banned from commenting on ScoMo’s Facebook for saying that the Australian Government is registered as a Privately Owned American Company…which it is. The Treasury website has a document released under FOI that clearly shows it is so.”The post links to the Treasury website and features documents, as per the heading on the relevant page, “relating to registration with the SEC of the Australian Government as a privately owned American company”.Similar posts can be found here and here, with one going on to claim people were being “controlled by a U.S. facist (sic), totalitarian, corporation”.At the time of writing, the Facebook posts had been shared more than 220 times and received at least 150 comments and reactions combined. A Facebook post claims the Australian government is a “privately owned American company”. The AnalysisWhile it is true that the Australian government has registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this is a routine process for the purposing of selling bonds and other financial instruments unrelated to the formation of a corporation – privately owned or otherwise.The SEC is tasked with protecting investors and overseeing US financial markets. As part of that brief, it requires most parties selling securities – essentially any tradable financial products – to provide certain information to potential buyers.It says that this allows investors to make informed purchases of securities, as set out under the Securities Act of 1933.SEC filings show that the Commonwealth of Australia, via its Washington embassy, has lodged a number of documents with the commission since 2002.For example, in 2006 the government filed a statement with the SEC relating to the issuance of Telstra shares, in which it then had a controlling stake.The document referenced in the Facebook post is a 2009 filing, which identifies that the Commonwealth of Australia was amending a registration statement under the 1933 Act.The document relates to the government’s 2008 decision to guarantee bank deposits and wholesale funding in the wake of the global financial crisis. The document makes no mention of the government establishing a foreign corporation.The Treasury website lists the document as being released under a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking access to “all documents that confirm the following: registration with the SEC of the Australian Government(Commonwealth of Australia) as a privately owned American company, file number:333-163307 CIK:0000805157”.These codes represent the government’s “central index key (CIK)” with the SEC, while the file number relates to a 2009 registration form for the so-called “state guarantee scheme” in which the federal government guaranteed the borrowings of Australia’s states and territories.That form is identified as being a “registration statement of securities of Foreign Governments and Subdivisions”, and again it contains no reference to establishing a foreign corporation.Professor Sinclair Davidson, an expert in institutional economics from RMIT University in Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview that the title of the Treasury web page featuring the FOI request was misleading as the document did not show the government was a “privately owned American company”.“In order to comply with American regulations to borrow money in America and to sell securities to American citizens, (Australia) has to comply with American securities law,” he said.“(The document) more or less provides investors information about Australia for the purposes of providing information to the market, but it’s stated very clearly within that document Australia is a sovereign nation.”Prof Davidson added that the implication that somehow the document showed Australia was “beholden to some other foreign power” was a “conspiracy theory”.Dr Karen Alpert, a lecturer from the University of Queensland’s School of Business, told AAP FactCheck the document on the Treasury website relates to government securities but it did not mean officials were “registering Australia itself”.She added that it appeared Treasury had just used the FOI request wording for the title of the corresponding page on it’s site, “even though that does not describe what’s happening”.A spokeswoman for Treasury told AAP FactCheck in an email that “the Australian government is not a US corporation”.“The Australian government was registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the purposes of guaranteeing ADI debt securities covered by the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding, which ended in 2015,” she said.NSW and Queensland are also registered with the SEC for similar reasons. A claim the Australian government is a US corporation has been dismissed as a “conspiracy theory”.","https://archive.vn/WdnH3,https://archive.vn/dPvnj#selection-473.0-504.0,https://archive.is/F2v0w,https://archive.vn/UOHaH,https://www.sec.gov/about.shtml,https://www.sec.gov/answers/about-lawsshtml.html,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000805157&owner=include&count=40,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805157/000095017206000088/was5319.txt,https://www.theage.com.au/business/pm-announces-8b-telstra-sale-20060826-ge305o.html,https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-03/FOI_2117_T198654.pdf,https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2016/mar/5.html,https://archive.vn/dPvnj#selection-473.0-504.0,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805157/000134100409002336/schedule_b.htm,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd0809/09bd157,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805157/000134100409002336/0001341004-09-002336-index.htm,https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/d/davidson-professor-sinclair,https://business.uq.edu.au/profile/167/karen-alpert,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000857076&,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001244818&","No, the Australian government isn’t a privately owned US company",,,,,,
76,,,,False,,2020-11-10,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/were-dead-people-in-michigan-able-to-vote-in-the-us-election/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementMultiple social media posts have shared claims that votes from people who died years before the 2020 US presidential election were counted in the closely contested poll.Several rely on voter records from the US state of Michigan to support their allegations. They come at the same time as US President Donald Trump has repeated unsubstantiated claims his campaign was the victim of voter fraud.One Facebook post includes a link to an article on the Rebel News website that includes claims a dead man, William Bradley, voted via absentee ballot in Michigan.The November 6 post reads “DEAD people registered to vote in Michigan database”, mirroring the article’s headline. It had been shared more than 750 times, drawing more than 300 comments and reactions at the time of publication.Another post, from November 5, features a screenshot of a tweet from former Australian senator Cory Bernardi, who founded but later disbanded the Australian Conservatives party. It also carries the caption, “Wow have a look. Dead people can vote”.Bernardi’s tweet includes a list of names, apparently drawn from a spreadsheet, their addresses and a column titled “YOB” with entries ranging from 1850 to 1902. It also includes William’s Bradley’s name.Bernardi’s tweet reads: “Good to see these seven active Michigan voters are all older than the oldest person alive. Heck, one was born in 1850! Happy 170th Birthday!”The Facebook post including the screenshot had been shared more than 200 times and attracted over 300 comments and reactions at the time of writing. Unsubstantiated claims that dead people could “vote” have been circulating since the US election. The AnalysisWhile most media outlets have called the US election for Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump has insisted that mass corruption of the voting system has skewed the results against him without providing credible evidence to support the suggestion.Widely circulated voter-fraud allegations include later-debunked claims that ballots in the names of as many as 14,000 dead people were cast in the state of Michigan.The Rebel News Australia article referenced in the November 6 post is centred on a series of tweets from right-wing activist Austen Fletcher, known online as ‘Fleccas’.The article says Mr Fletcher “found a number of votes tied to dead individuals, some of whom passed away decades ago” before going on to credit him for his “discovery of voter fraud”.One of Mr Fletcher’s tweets, which has since received more than 47,600 retweets and 88,300 likes, reads: “Turns out 118-year-old ‘William Bradley’ voted via absentee ballot in Wayne County, Michigan. How long has this been going on?”A search of the US Social Security Death Index shows a William Bradley was born in March 1902 and died in 1984. A search of Michigan voter records using the same information shows Mr Bradley registered to vote, with his absentee ballot listed as returned on October 2.However, a search of the Michigan residents database also reveals another William Bradley, born in 1959, living in the same ZIP code. He told PolitiFact that he received both his own ballot and one for his deceased father, but he had thrown the second ballot away.Lawrence Garcia, the principal attorney for the city of Detroit, told CNN the younger Mr Bradley’s vote was “was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago through a clerical error”.Michigan’s Department of State also responded to Mr Fletcher’s Twitter thread, saying: “This is misinformation. Ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day.”In a statement of “fact checks” on Michigan’s Secretary of State’s website, it added that “on rare occasions a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead”.“This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file; for example, someone born in 1990 accidentally recorded as born in 1890.“In such scenarios, no one ineligible has actually voted, and there is no impact on the outcome of the election.”In a fact check of similar claims, CNN tested a sample of 50 of the 14,000 names on a list of potentially dead “voters”. Of the sample, it found 37 were dead and had not recorded a vote, five were alive and had voted, while eight were alive and had not voted.“Not a single one of the names examined was of a dead person voting,” it said. Unsubstantiated claims of dead people “voting” have been circulating since the US election.","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-10/fox-cuts-white-house-briefing-trump-us-election-fraud-claims/12866816,https://archive.is/Zz97Y,https://www.rebelnews.com/dead_people_registered_to_vote_in_michigan_database,https://archive.is/3hPPF,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=G0D,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-20/cory-bernardi-de-registering-australian-conservatives/11230750,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/joe-biden-kamala-harris-presidency-called-media-outlets-election-2020-11?r=US&IR=T,https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-79c34b72633683af195ae945503883fe,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/08/fact-check-false-claim-14-k-dead-people-voted-michigan/6201900002/,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7052799/,https://archive.is/Io4Jg,https://search.findmypast.com.au/search-world-records-in-life-events-bdms,https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aap-nw-aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10151648/4143912B-46C8-45FA-903C-15B498AABED8.png.jpg,https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index,https://www.michiganresidentdatabase.com/person/777535/william-bradley#overview,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/05/facebook-posts/no-dead-voter-named-william-bradley-didnt-vote-det/,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/michigan-dead-voter-fact-debunking/index.html,https://archive.is/0glTw,https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_100423_102534_102535---,00.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/michigan-dead-voter-fact-debunking/index.html",Were dead people in Michigan able to ‘vote’ in the US election?,,,,,,

Staph infections can be treated with antibiotics.But Dr Louise Reiche, president of the NZ Dermatological Society, said face masks do not cause staph infections, which were generally a result of damaged skin.“If you’ve got damaged skin then damaged skin is more susceptible to secondarily picking up an infection, whether it be staph or another infection,” she told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview.“That’s because the skin surface, when the skin is intact, is a good barrier against the outside world. But if the barrier is disrupted, then it’s easier for infections, allergies and other matters to get in.”UNSW Sydney epidemiologist Dr Abrar Ahmad Chughtai told AAP FactCheck in a phone interview that there was no scientific basis to the claims of the post.“We’ve never seen this. Many healthcare workers have been using face masks for many years. I also have been using masks and I have never faced this problem,” he said.A 2001 study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, found that wearing masks significantly reduced the chances that chances of staff becoming carriers of methicillin-resistant staph, an antibiotic-resistant strain of the bacteria, when they were exposed to the pathogen in a dedicated treatment ward.“Staph bacteria is present on our nose, on our mouth, it’s very common. If there is a breach in the skin, for example, if there is already a cut on the face or acne, this is the only possible way an infection could happen,” Dr Chugtai said.Nevertheless, he advised those with skin conditions or related problems against wearing masks.The Learn About Covid19 blog, run by a group of public health experts and journalists, offers similar advice: “In order to develop a staph infection, the person wearing the mask would have to have an open lesion or untreated wound on their face, but even then, it very rarely happens.”It recommends people use moisturiser to protect their skin from any irritation that could develop into an open wound.According to UC Health, a not-for-profit health care system in Colorado, there are several ways people can prevent staph infections. These include keeping cuts and scrapes clean until they heal, avoiding contact with others’ wounds and not sharing personal items such as towels and razors.Similar claims about masks causing staph infections have been debunked here, here and here. Face masks do not cause staph infections, experts say.","http://archive.vn/IOnJa,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak,https://www.aap.com.au/face-mask-oxygen-deprivation-claims-are-a-lot-of-hot-air/,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-disease-comparison-masks-vital-differences/,https://archive.vn/5FFGO,https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/abr9564,https://www.nzdsi.org/Dermatologist-Detail.aspx?id=acf55540-bc82-4031-86d7-4c19f30f9142,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-abrar-ahmad-chughtai,https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(01)91024-2/pdf,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336,https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/is-there-any-evidence-for-a-relationship-between-staph-infections-and-using-masks-to-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/,https://learnaboutcovid19.org/about/,https://www.uchealth.org/services/infectious-diseases/diseases-and-conditions/3,40388/,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/08/fact-check-no-evidence-that-face-masks-cause-staph-infections.html?fbclid=IwAR1d80VnK5sgp0qreRGAnkDgJDC-0USUoi1d3itGI66GEXAaxE8I0Zeojdw,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/18/fact-check-staph-infections-common-not-caused-face-masks/5692064002/,https://apnews.com/article/9253760743",Do face masks cause ‘staph’ infections?,,,,,,

Your secularism & tolerance can not change our ideology. Quran does NOT permit the survival of Non-Muslims”.The caption running along the top and bottom of the image reads, “This is Islam. Islamophobic yet?”At the time of writing, the post had more than 740 shares and attracted more than 980 reactions and 390 comments. A Facebook post has been circulated with purported quotes calling for the killing of non-Muslims. The AnalysisThe man whose photo was used in the post – real name Abdullah Juber – was reportedly acquitted on terror charges in India, and has no connection to the purported quote, according to the news website that published the original image.The image of the man featured in the post was used in a 2014 post on TwoCircles.net, a US-based site providing news for the Indian Muslim community.The article was about three men, one of whom was named Abdullah Juber, who it said were left in jail in India for eight years on terror-related charges before they were eventually acquitted.A similar meme to that in the October 27 post featuring an image of Mr Juber – whose face was cropped from a photo included in the TwoCircles article – and a quote in Hindi was circulated online in 2014.An English version of the meme that included the Jihad quote was shared in 2017, with the source named as “Abdullah Zuber”.TwoCircles responded to the memes in 2017, when it published an article saying its “exclusively captured” photo of Mr Juber had been photoshopped and circulated online with a fake quote. It included several versions of the meme featuring Hindi text.The site included the original image of Mr Juber along with data it said showed the image was captured in 2014 and digitally altered to fit the meme format.The site quoted Mr Juber as saying: “Even after I am innocent in the eyes of judiciary and constitution, I think mob is not going to spare me. But I have to make it clear that I have not said anything like this ever in my life, even I cannot think if I would say such.”The post resurfaced in 2019 following the election of two Muslims to the US Congress the previous year. Included below the quote and photograph was the text: “Keep this in mind as new members of Congress who are Muslim are sworn into office on this book of death and inequality.”It was again shared following the Christchurch terror attack in March 2019, during which an Australian gunman killed 50 people at two mosques. A caption claimed Abdullah Zuber said the quote in response to BBC questions, however the UK broadcaster told AFP it did not interview anyone by that name following the shootings in New Zealand.An Indian website earlier said it had “stumbled upon a factory of fake quotes” being circulated in the names of actors, authors, activists and politicians to polarise people along religious lines.Its list of false quotes included the meme featuring Mr Juber’s image and a similar statement to that featured in the English-language versions,Associate professor Mehmet Ozalp, a theologian and founding director of the Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation at Charles Sturt University, explained to AAP FactCheck in an email the “Qur’an talks about warfare and fighting in just wars as a necessary evil and sets legal and ethical guidelines around it”.In a book chapter, Dr Ozalp wrote that after the Prophet Mohammad migrated to Medina in Saudi Arabia, he “established a pluralistic and multifaith society” and took “active steps to sign treaties with all neighbouring tribes”.“Military wars that the Prophet Muhammad or Muslims had to engage in were either purely defensive or they were pre-emptive strikes against the other party who were preparing to attack Muslims,” he wrote.Dr Ozalp said a verse from the Koran, which critics quoted to argue that Islam is inherently violent, is often taken out of context as it leaves out the verse’s ending.The verse starts, “When the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them and confine them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush…”But continues, “…but if they repent and perform prescribed prayers and give charitable alms then let them go their way, for God is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful”.In this case, “idolaters” refers to individuals who carry out acts of terrorism against a peaceful society and a popular and legitimate government, Dr Ozalp wrote. An Islamic scholar says a Koran quote is often misused to claim the religion is inherently violent.","https://archive.vn/B5i0F,https://twocircles.net/2014mar01/after_8_years_jail_terror_charges_three_persons_acquitted_kolkata_court.html,https://twocircles.net/about.html,https://archive.vn/eIXOF,https://archive.vn/VMOls,https://web.archive.org/web/20171024002944/http://twocircles.net/2017sep27/417140.html/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/29/facebook-posts/fact-checking-fabricated-quote-about-violence-agai/?fbclid=IwAR02-Pjocx_XD3NBstEZbFj3zUsUnoiqpMdpEIKYGhGXcJBZ6Uvj4fHI-b4,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-man-did-not-tell-bbc-after-new-zealand-mosque-shootings-jihad-will-continue-until-all-hindus,https://www.altnews.in/alt-news-unearths-factory-fake-quotes-dangerous-trend/,https://arts-ed.csu.edu.au/centres/cisac/staff/profiles/director/mehmet-ozalp ,https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aap-nw-aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06121511/Peace-and-Military-Engagement-in-the-Quran-and-in-the-Actions-of-the-Prophet-Muhammad-v3.pdf",False Islam quote attached to acquitted terror suspect resurfaces,,,,,,

The appearance featured a discussion about Mr Trump’s swipe at the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, after she called for Americans to vote.At the time of writing, the October 27 post had been viewed more than 16,000 times and attracted more than 160 shares and 300 reactions. A Facebook post falsely claims Ita Buttrose backed Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The AnalysisWhile Ms Buttrose’s on-air comments backed the US president’s criticism of Markle, she didn’t extend her endorsement to Mr Trump as leader for the vote.Ms Buttrose, who was announced as ABC chair in March 2019, previously worked as a journalist, editor and executive at several of Australia’s biggest news organisations, including a famous stint as founding editor of Cleo magazine under media mogul Kerry Packer.She was also a founding member of the panel for Studio 10, which airs on weekday mornings. Since leaving the show in 2018, she has returned for a series of guest appearances.In late September, Ms Buttrose took part in a discussion on the show about Prince Harry and wife Meghan calling for Americans to vote in the US election.In a Time 100 video message, Markle described the 2020 poll as the most important election of people’s lifetimes, while Harry called on people to “reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity” – comments perceived by commentators as being anti-Trump.The following day, Mr Trump responded with comments aimed at Markle. “I’m not a fan of hers,” he said, adding: “I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he’s going to need it.”According to The Australian’s Media Diary column on September 28, when asked on Studio 10 what she thought of Mr Trump’s comments, Ms Buttrose replied: “I think he probably said something that many people think.”“As an Australian, if someone from Britain came here and told me I should be voting and I should be doing this and that, then I’d be telling him to butt out of our business,” she added, according to the column. Video of the segment is not publicly available.The Australian article, which featured the segment, carries the tongue-in-cheek headline, “ABC first: Ita Buttrose backs Donald Trump”, while the lede reads: “Ita Buttrose has taken a public position that must be an ABC first: backing Donald Trump.”However the Facebook post, which otherwise repeats much of the column verbatim, adds the words “to win the American presidential election” to the end of the sentence. Another Facebook post, from October 28, includes just the article’s headline and an image of Ms Buttrose without additional context.Ms Buttrose told AAP FactCheck via an email from an ABC spokesman that “recent claims I support President Trump are simply not true”.“I never said it. I have not stated any position on the US election as it is a matter for American voters,” she said.“Of course I have my private views, and the outcome of this election will have far reaching ramifications for democracy in the US and for the rest of the world, particularly countries like Australia who have such strong trade links with the US.”On November 2, The Australian’s Media Diary featured a follow-up report, headlined, “Ita: ‘I’m not a Trump barracker'”. It said Ms Buttrose contacted the column “after Twitter lit up last week with trolling” suggesting she favoured Mr Trump over Joe Biden – which she categorically denied. ABC chair Ita Buttrose says the US election is a matter for American voters.","https://archive.vn/xH4LD ,https://about.abc.net.au/profile/ita-buttrose/,https://about.abc.net.au/profile/ita-buttrose/,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/cleo-taught-me-to-be-bold-ita-buttrose,https://10play.com.au/studio-10/about,https://youtu.be/Ns1QtLeBr9U,https://time.com/5891136/prince-harry-meghan-markle-vote-2020-election/,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54257450,https://youtu.be/Iyivk0docNk,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/fran-kelly-fights-to-end-ban-on-qa-rape-debate/news-story/84810b7c603082fe8b100dda7506e5d1 ,https://archive.vn/Ur5Ci,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/ita-buttrose-slams-fake-news-but-offers-donald-trump-faketan-tips/news-story/d5c387f0aed2aca2113531465de30106",ABC chief Ita Buttrose hasn’t endorsed Donald Trump in the US election,,,,,,
80,,,,False,,2020-11-05,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/experts-clamp-down-claims-linking-umbilical-cord-cutting-to-vaccines/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post advises future parents to wait an hour before cutting their baby’s umbilical cord to avoid a range of negative health effects.According to the October 24 post, there is an “unspoken and unofficial rule in maternity – hospitals” to sever the umbilical cord immediately after birth.The post states that the “umbilical cord must NOT be cut until 1 HOUR AFTER BIRTH”.“If the umbilical cord is cut immediately, the baby won’t have enough blood right after birth. However, the blood in the placenta contains the natural spectrum of baby immunity,” it reads.“In other words, if the umbilical cord is cut immediately, part of the baby’s natural immunity is deliberately denied.”The lengthy post goes on to claim that medical professionals benefited from babies having poor immunity as it provided a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 450 times and had attracted more than 915,000 views. A post advises to wait an hour before cutting a baby’s umbilical cord to provide “natural immunity”. The AnalysisWhile there is evidence that waiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord has some health benefits, AAP FactCheck could not find any health institute or credible research that recommended waiting an hour.The World Health Organization recommends waiting at least a minute before clamping the umbilical cord to reduce the incidence of iron-deficiency anaemia in infants.“Delaying cord clamping (by more than one minute) allows blood flow between the placenta and neonate to continue, which may improve iron status in the infant for up to six months after birth,” the WHO article reads.“This may be particularly relevant for infants living in low-resource settings with reduced access to iron-rich foods.”But the WHO made no recommendations on waiting significantly longer periods than one minute to cut the umbilical cord.The American College of Nurse-Midwives recommends waiting between two and five minutes before clamping the cord, depending on the circumstances (page 1).It says immediately clamping the umbilical cord after birth had been practiced for decades and there were concerns that delayed clamping “would result in neonatal respiratory distress, polycythemia, and jaundice from circulatory overload”.However, the ACNM says recent research found these complications did not occur and waiting a few minutes to clamp the cord increased the transfusion of iron-rich blood to the baby, increased birth weights and decreased the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia.A report by the UK’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said research had found blood flow continued through the umbilical cord for a few minutes after birth (page 2).It recommended deferring clamping the cord for at least two minutes, although it added that more research needed to be done into the alternative clamping strategies (page 2, 7).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also advises delaying umbilical clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth, which it says has benefits although it also carries a small increase in the risk of jaundice.The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends waiting at least a minute. “If the woman requests that the cord is clamped and cut later than five minutes, support her in her choice,” it adds (page 67).On the issue of early age immunisation, the Victorian government’s Better Health Channel says the measure is highly recommended for all children.It says babies receive some passive immunity from their mothers, derived from antibodies transferred during pregnancy, but the level of antibody protection can be low and wears off quickly.“This puts them at risk of diseases that can be prevented with vaccination,” it says.The New Zealand Ministry of Health also says passive immunity did not last long after birth and “babies and children need immunisation to provide ongoing protection from many life-threatening diseases” (page 5).Dr Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne Medical School, said there was no evidence that waiting an hour before clamping the umbilical cord had any health benefits.“Once the umbilical cord stops pulsating, the blood flow has stopped and it is just dead tissue,” he told AAP FactCheck during a phone interview.Dr Polyakov said all babies needed to be vaccinated, regardless of how long they remained attached to the umbilical cord.“Vaccines are the only way to ensure the baby won’t get diseases like whooping cough or measles.”University of Auckland associate professor of maternal and perinatal health Katie Groom said there was good evidence for waiting one minute before cutting the umbilical cord, particularly in preterm babies, but there was no evidence that waiting an hour was beneficial.“There is ongoing research into the benefits of waiting longer than one minute, but that means three to five minutes and certainly not an hour,” Dr Groom told AAP FactCheck via phone.She said there was no physiological reason why waiting an hour would improve immunity or reduce the need for vaccinations. The WHO recommends waiting at least a minute before clamping a baby’s umbilical cord.","https://archive.vn/ZLpUA,https://www.who.int/elena/titles/cord_clamping/en/,http://www.midwife.org/ACNM/files/ACNMLibraryData/UPLOADFILENAME/000000000290/Delayed-Umbilical-Cord-Clamping-May-2014.pdf,https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/scientific-impact-papers/sip-14.pdf,https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/01/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth,https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190/resources/intrapartum-care-for-healthy-women-and-babies-pdf-35109866447557,https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/immunisation-childhood,https://www.healthed.govt.nz/system/files/resource-files/HE1323_Childhood%20immunisation.pdf,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/772397-alex-polyakov,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/k-groom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097178/",Experts

However both the actor and French media have said the interview never took place, and the claimed quotes were fabricated.Culkin is best known for his starring role as Kevin McCallister in the Home Alone movie franchise during the 1990s before he turning his back on Hollywood following a series of box office flops. He later revealed his father was “physically and emotionally” abusive during his childhood.The claims included in the Facebook post appeared on several websites – here, here and here – in December 2017. The articles claim Culkin told French radio that Hollywood movie executives were “blood-thirsty Satanists” who ritualistically abused and murdered child actors.An article from the website Neon Nettle – which features in FactCheck.org’s Misinformation Directory as a repeated source of false information – matches the first five paragraphs in the post’s screenshot.The article claims that French media initially picked up Culkin’s story after he gave his radio interview but “within an hour of publication, all reports began to disappear”.It also featured a screenshot of a purported news article by French financial publication Les Echos detailing Culkin’s purported claims. Les Echos previously confirmed to French fact checking outlet Hoax Buster and Reuters it never published the purported article.A spokesperson for Culkin told Reuters that a lengthy quote detailing the alleged abuse featured in the Neon Nettle and other articles “is not only false it is completely fabricated”.“It is offensive and misleading and should be disregarded entirely,” the spokesperson added.Previous versions of the claim have been debunked here, here, here and here. Macaulay Culkin did not make the comments attributed to a French radio interview.","https://archive.vn/ZrWy0,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000346/,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/weekend/why-it-was-not-a-wonderful-life-for-macaulay-culkin-after-he-found-fame-in-the-hit-christmas-film-home-alone-37620091.html,https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/macaulay-culkin-speaks-out-about-childhood-abuse-for-the-first-time/6fd0b4c4-15ab-468c-81d1-f4714e93a7cc,https://web.archive.org/web/20180125040149/https://theneonnettle.com/features/1272-macaulay-culkin-satanic-hollywood-elites-murder-children-during-rituals,http://archive.is/ekumf,https://web.archive.org/web/20171219061327/http://thedisclosenews.com/macaulay-culkin-satanic-hollywood-elites-murder-children-rituals/#,https://web.archive.org/web/20180125040149/https://theneonnettle.com/features/1272-macaulay-culkin-satanic-hollywood-elites-murder-children-during-rituals,https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories/,https://www.lesechos.fr/,https://www.hoaxbuster.com/medias-et-techno/2018/01/19/les-chos-font-du-bruit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-culkin-quote-idUSKCN24O28C,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-culkin-quote-idUSKCN24O28C,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/macauley-culkin-satanic-hollywood/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-culkin-quote-idUSKCN24O28C,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/07/fact-check-macaulay-culkin-did-not-say-satanic-hollywood-elites-murder-children-during-rituals.html?fbclid=IwAR2aNwArR20TlIb6Q_m8Y2uB_XGttRosnF4v8qtjgJw-Gs1QmCfZ4JGCCzw,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/25/fact-check-macaulay-culkin-statement-hollywood-child-abuse/?fbclid=IwAR3Gfs0KRrBzM96lhcG_c694b4TRMpTK4DzLOw9GIJvjlG6_PRM0n0gqKlk",Article details fake Macaulay Culkin ‘satanic Hollywood’ revelations,,,,,,

The accompanying text states: “A deer that became riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup. It seems fairly common.”At the top of the post is a banner at the top, which says: “LABOUR LOVES ROUNDUP ITS (sic) THEIR BEST FRIEND & 99% OF NEW ZEALAND THOUGHT SHE LOVE THEM ha ha”.Beneath the image, the post also claims: “NEW ZEALAND COUNCIL OVER USES (sic) ROUNDUP IN ALL PARKS PLUS OTHER PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY.”At the time of publication, the October 19 post had been shared more than 240 times and attracted more than 15,000 views. A photo of a deer riddled with growths has been circulating on social media in New Zealand. The AnalysisPatented by Monsanto and sold under the Roundup brand, glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in New Zealand and across the world. It is used to kill a broad range of weeds.However, there have been calls (see examples here and here) for the use of glyphosate in New Zealand to be reconsidered due to concerns it causes cancer.The Facebook post claims the deer pictured in the post became “riddled with tumours from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup”.But the same image of the deer included in the post was tweeted by the Ohio Division of Wildlife in October 2017 as an example of an animal with “unsightly warts” called fibromas.Cutaneous fibromas, “more commonly called deer warts by hunters”, are found in deer herds in the “majority” of US states, according to an article by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP).Fibromas are caused by a virus thought to be transmitted by insects biting the animals, although it is also possible the disease is contracted when contaminated objects scratch or penetrate a deer’s skin, the agency said.The same growths are known to affect other wild animals in the US such as squirrels and rabbits.Daniel Schmidt, the vice-president of US-based publisher Deer & Deer Hunting, confirmed to AAP FactCheck via email that the deer in the image was suffering from cutaneous fibromas. He has previously addressed the condition in a blog post that addressed a similar Roundup claim.“In short, it’s not too unlike warts in humans,” he said. “The condition isn’t fatal, and the nodules typically fall off after the cycle or, in the case of northern deer, in winter.”The cause of fibromas in deer is also explained by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR).The post’s claim linking the deer “tumours” to Roundup has also been debunked here, here, here and here.The post also claims “NEW ZEALAND COUNCIL OVER USES ROUNDUP IN ALL PARKS PLUS OTHER PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY”. It does not identify which council.

83,,,,False,,2020-10-30,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-drinking-water-from-a-copper-cup-deliver-major-health-benefits/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims drinking water from a copper cup has a range of health benefits, including helping to lower the risk of cancer and heart disease.The post, from October 16, includes an image of a copper-coloured cup alongside text claiming drinking water from the vessel will variously kill bacteria; stimulate the brain; regulate the functioning of the thyroid gland; soothe arthritis pain; boost skin health; slow down ageing; improve digestion; “get rid of anemia”; and lower risk of cancer and heart disease.It was posted by Fijian radio station Mirchi FM Fiji, which has more than 112,000 Facebook followers. At the time of publication the post had been shared more than 90 times, attracting more than 34,000 views.A reverse image search reveals the image has been used hundreds of times online. One 2019 Facebook post including the image has been shared more than 9,600 times.The image includes a brand label for Cure Joy, a company with a website and social media channels that promote “natural health and wellness”. The image was shared on the Cure Joy Facebook page in March 2018. A Facebook meme suggests drinking from a copper cup delivers a series of health benefits. The AnalysisWhile copper is a crucial element in a healthy diet and supports a range of bodily functions, there are no benefits to drinking from a vessel made from the heavy metal, experts say.The US National Institute of Health’s (NIH) fact sheet on copper says copper is an essential mineral involved in processes including brain development and immune system function.But it adds the typical US diet already exceeds the recommended daily allowance for copper and deficiency in the metal is uncommon. The recommended daily allowance for adults is 900 micrograms (mcg) (table 1), but on average men consume 1400mcg and women consume 1100mcg, it says.Many foods are naturally high in copper, with one unpeeled potato delivering 675mcg of the mineral (table 2). The NIH puts the “tolerable upper intake level” for adults at 10,000mcg, or 10mg.It says the effects of copper deficiency, which is uncommon, include anaemia, high cholesterol, osteoporosis and an increased risk of infection. Copper deficiency may also play a role in heart disease but the results of studies are mixed, as are expert views on the role of copper in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.Professor Ashley Bush, a neuroscientiest and director of the Melbourne Dementia Research Centre, told AAP FactCheck via email that the image in the Facebook post was misleading as people only needed a small amount of copper in their diet each day and deficiency was rare.“It is essential, but more is not better,” Prof Bush said. His research has focused on the role of metal biology in neurodegenerative brain diseases.“Excess copper can be harmful but also difficult to achieve. Copper cups should be harmless enough, but there are no benefits.”A 2016 review of the evidence on dietary copper and human health, published in the Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology, found the metal was neither beneficial nor harmful for a range of conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, arthritis and cancer.It found limited evidence that a very low copper intake was linked with impaired immune function in healthy subjects, noting that there were few reports of deficiency in the general population except among formerly obese patients after gastric-bypass surgery.Another review into the health impacts of copper, by Polish academics, said high concentrations of copper in drinking water had been linked to infant deaths in a number of countries and that copper may contribute to cancer growth.However it noted that copper deficiency could contribute to heart disease and was associated with osteoporosis and a poor immune response.Copper is known to have antibacterial properties. A study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology found “metallic copper surfaces rapidly and efficiently kill bacteria” and trials in laboratories and hospitals had shown copper surfaces effectively kill a wide range of microbes.Another study, published in the Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition, found that storing water in copper pots for 16 hours killed bacteria. The vessels were found to leach the mineral, however this was done at only five per cent the maximum safe level included in World Health Organization guidelines.Scott Ayton, deputy director of the Melbourne Dementia Research Centre, studies the role of copper and other metals in the ageing process and in neurodegenerative diseases.He told AAP FactCheck via email and in a phone interview that copper did have a range of health benefits but most people got enough copper from their diet.He agreed that the amount of the metal you would ingest from drinking water from a copper cup would not be enough to be either beneficial or harmful.“It would be more effective to eat copper-rich foods than using a cup as a copper source,” Dr Ayton said.“That said, copper deficiency is not ordinarily a problem, and eating more copper is unlikely to translate to any of those beneficial claims.”A large portion of the population already had copper in their drinking water as copper pipes were the most common way to transport water throughout the world, he said.Dr Ayton added that copper did have antibacterial properties but ingesting it wouldn’t necessarily confer health benefits.“Copper is antibacterial, but just because something is antibacterial doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to ingest it,” he said. “It’s analogous to injecting bleach.“We may expect that less bacteria will grow on a copper cup, but another simple solution is to just wash a normal cup before you use it.”The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) public health statement for copper notes that people may be exposed to high levels of copper in their drinking water if corrosive water is passed through copper plumbing and brass fixtures.It says exposure to higher doses of copper may cause nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.The NIH says chronic exposure to high levels of copper could result in liver damage and gastrointestinal symptoms, and copper toxicity has been reported in people who drank water which had been sitting stagnant in copper plumbing.In Australia, some state authorities recommend initially flushing water systems for 30 seconds to reduce copper concentrations before drinking (see examples here and here).People can ingest dangerous doses of copper due to contamination in pipe systems.","https://archive.vn/l1xH0,https://www.facebook.com/mirchifmfiji/,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-NZ&tbs=simg:CAQSnQIJjbri8w6_1cYUakQILELCMpwgaYgpgCAMSKMkdyh2oE4YIhwi0CLUIgwiCCJ8IwzTMPcs91DTWNNk9zjTENNs9yT0aMNGiP-PLjJKftrPh4UVKa73RJDomoq5_1rcKjJPY6R3Z-qa-yho7x6fHZ_1hAMuQgVLSAEDAsQjq7-CBoKCggIARIETzzb1wwLEJ3twQkaiQEKFgoDY3Vw2qWI9gMLCgkvbS8wOGdxcG0KHgoKY29mZmVlIGN1cNqliPYDDAoKL20vMDJwNWYxcQoWCgNtdWfapYj2AwsKCS9tLzAyanZoOQoYCgVhd2FyZNqliPYDCwoJL20vMDJ3M2hsCh0KCXNlcnZld2FyZdqliPYDDAoKL20vMGg4bjIydgw&sxsrf=ALeKk01nH_4v4JLCskY_J2wI9kazsdykbw:1603850765026&q=copper+cup+benefits+to+health&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiu3_zYmdbsAhWFb30KHUnXDUQQ2A4oAXoECBAQLA&biw=1283&bih=670&dpr=2,https://archive.vn/k7muW,https://www.curejoy.com/content/about-curejoy/,https://archive.vn/Vbi1e,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/,https://florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-ashley-bush,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X16300207?via%3Dihub,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4113679/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028699/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312355/,https://florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/dr-scott-ayton,https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=204&tid=37,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/,https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/environmental-health/environmental-health-in-the-home/copper-in-water,https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/Copper-in-drinking-water",Does drinking water from a copper cup deliver major health benefits?,,,,,,

Text examples of the same message have also been widely shared in the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential election. A purported political message from actor Clint Eastwood reflecting in his “twilight years”. The AnalysisThe message is one of several sets of quotes falsely attributed to the Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood, who has publicly supported conservative US politicians in the past.The fake quotes in the post have been circulating online for more than six years and were originally worded to attack then-president Barack Obama.Despite his support for previous Republican leaders, Eastwood has made no public comments endorsing either President Donald Trump or Mr Biden in the current election campaign.The “preparing to say goodbye” message from Eastwood targeting Mr Obama reportedly dates back to 2013 and has been included on multiple websites, such as here, here and here.In March 2014, Snopes debunked the alleged Eastwood letter, which it traced to now-dead conservative message board links from late the previous year.While earlier versions of the post referred to Mr Obama by name, the current iteration retains the reference to a “Muslim loving, socialist crap hole … and I don’t mean Hawaii” despite the message now taking aim at Mr Biden. Mr Obama was born in Hawaii, while Mr Biden was born in Pennsylvania.A spokeswoman for the actor told AAP FactCheck via email that the quote was falsely attributed to Eastwood, adding that he had endorsed neither Mr Trump nor Mr Biden. AAP FactCheck has debunked previous quotes in favour of Mr Trump falsely attributed to the actor during the 2020 presidential campaign.In the past, Eastwood has supported Republican candidates, including an infamous appearance at the 2012 Republican National Convention where he endorsed presidential candidate Mitt Romney.During the convention, Eastwood addressed an empty chair representing the absent president Barack Obama – a speech he later said he regretted.Eastwood also expressed cautious support for Mr Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election, telling Esquire magazine he would “have to go for” the Republican candidate over Democrat Hillary Clinton but added it was “a tough one” because “there’s been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle”.But in February of this year, during the Democratic presidential primary contests, he expressed support for candidate Mike Bloomberg in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.He also expressed distaste for Mr Trump “tweeting and calling people names”, saying he wished the president would act in a “more genteel way” – statements at adds with the acerbic language used in the Facebook post.Similar posts have recently been debunked here and here. Clint Eastwood has supported Republican candidates – but he hasn’t spoken out against Joe Biden.","https://archive.is/i4kBq,https://archive.is/i4kBq,https://archive.vn/rYCgS,http://www.vista.sahafi.jo/art.php?id=9d36e240bb2be7c4f8bb6a8235533b2c5395281e,https://fau4u2.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90-clint-is-preparing-to-say-good-bye-%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90/,https://www.pineforestjewelry.com/blog-post/my-twilight-years-clint-eastwood,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/twilight-years/,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf,https://joebiden.com/joes-story/,https://www.aap.com.au/is-clint-eastwood-really-making-trumps-day-with-an-endorsement/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-19121795,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/08/04/clint-eastwood-really-regrets-that-whole-empty-chair-bit-at-the-2012-gop-convention/,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a46893/double-trouble-clint-and-scott-eastwood/,https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/a-hollywood-legend-talks-politics/ar-BB10fCtD,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/28/viral-image/old-fake-clint-eastwood-quote-about-obama-turns-fa/,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27D2O7","No, Clint Eastwood didn’t mark his ‘twilight years’ with a Biden attack",,,,,,

There is no evidence the election was “rigged” or the result was tampered with in any way.The 2020 national New Zealand poll was held on October 17. The preliminary count shows 2,383,796 votes were cast at the election, from which the Jacinda Ardern-led Labour Party won 49.1 per cent of the total.In the 2017 election, official results from the Electoral Commission showed 2,591,896 votes cast, excluding informal and disallowed votes. This is a difference of 208,100 from the 2020 preliminary results and near the “200,000 plus” figure cited in the post.However, the preliminary 2020 results do not represent the final voting total, which is predicted to include another 480,000 special declaration votes. The official results will be released on November 6.A spokesperson for the New Zealand Electoral Commission told AAP FactCheck in an email that the claim in the post is false.“The Electoral Commission can assure New Zealanders that no votes are missing and votes have not been removed from the count,” the spokesperson said.“It’s estimated that there will be approximately 480,000 special declaration votes taking the total number of votes cast this election to around 2.8 million.”The estimate of special votes was also included in the commission’s election night media release. Special votes include votes cast overseas or by telephone dictation, by people voting outside of their electorate or who enrolled late, Wellington lawyer Graeme Edgler wrote in an explanatory blog.The Commission noted in its statement to AAP FactCheck that “New Zealand has a robust and transparent electoral system with many checks and balances”.“The process for counting votes is thorough and careful. It is subject to independent scrutiny from candidate and party scrutineers, Justices of the Peace, and the judiciary if there are recounts or electoral petitions.” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern casts her vote during the New Zealand election.","https://archive.is/8wPI1,https://vote.nz/,https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020_preliminary/,https://www.labour.org.nz/jacindaardern,https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2017/new-zealand-2017-general-election-official-results/,https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/preliminary-results-for-the-2020-general-election/,https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/preliminary-results-for-the-2020-general-election/,https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/register/graeme-kenneth-edgeler/,https://publicaddress.net/legalbeagle/election-20-the-special-votes/",Thousands of ‘missing votes’ from NZ election are a social media mirage,,,,,,

The post had attracted more than 400 shares, 340 reactions and 27,000 views at the time of publication.The meme begins with the words: “Marcus Cicero (43 BC) of the Roman empire wrote this amazing wisdom.”It then continues with a list of nine witticisms, which read: “1. The poor – work & work. 2. The rich – exploit the poor. 3. The soldier – protects both. 4. The taxpayer – pays for all three. 5. The banker – robs all four. 6. The lawyer – misleads all five. 7. The doctor – bills all six. 8. The goons – scare all seven. 9. The Politician – lives happily on account of all eight.”Users in several countries have posted the same meme, with many of the posts attracting hundreds of shares (see here, here, here and here). Marcus Cicero was credited with the show of “amazing wisdom” included in this meme. The AnalysisMarcus Tullius Cicero was born in 106 BC and rose to become a member of the Roman senate, at one point taking on Rome’s highest office as consul. He was murdered in 43 BC, however his thoughts are preserved in his writings and speeches he made as both a lawyer and senator.Cicero’s death followed the fall of the Roman Republic, which he fought to save from a series of rulers who attempted to take control of the empire. He is renowned as a public speaker, politician and philosopher, according to the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.In a YouTube video, Cicero scholar Gesine Manuwald, a professor of Latin at University College London, describes Cicero as one of the greatest orators of the Roman Republic.Cicero left behind a bulk of written material, and is the subject of numerous quote pages online, such as here and here.The quote attributed to Cicero in the Facebook meme has been widely shared on the internet for several years in differing forms.An early example, from August 2012, features 11 witticisms instead of nine. It was posted to OccupyForum, part of a site linked to the Occupy Wall Street movement.It was provided by forum member “Benjamin“, who provides no information about the source of the purported Cicero quote.The same 11 observations were shared again in December 2013 in a Quora thread about famous Cicero quotes. However the quote is not drawn from any of Cicero’s works, according to two academics familiar with his writings.Sean McConnell, head of classics at Otago University in Dunedin, told AAP FactCheck in an email that he could not “think of anything in Cicero that would lend itself to this meme”.“It is quite strange,” said Dr McConnell, who is the author of Philosophical Life in Cicero’s Letters.Professor Jon Hall of Otago University, whose research focuses on Cicero’s letters and speeches, said in a phone interview that the modern language of the meme, such as its use of the word “goons”, immediately suggested the words did not belong to Cicero.Prof Hall said he had never seen the content of the meme in any of Cicero’s works, which included 58 speeches, 17 treatises and some 900 letters.“To me it seems like somebody’s come up with this cynical take on the world. By hanging it on Cicero it kind of gives it a patina of authority, or of longevity.’Prof Hall, who is the author of Politeness and Politics in Cicero’s Letters, added that the tone of the meme did not align with Cicero’s views.“At one stage he opposed some plans for land distribution to the poor – successfully,” he said.“He was through and through a senatorial man; and even though he was not from a traditional aristocratic family, he was still aligned with the conservatives.“It’s got to be remembered that the senate had a property qualification, which was equivalent to millions of New Zealand dollars. He’s not a rags-to-riches kind of guy; his father, even though he wouldn’t have been in the senate, was still a very rich man.”A 2016 Snopes factcheck on the list of 11 observations attributed to Cicero noted that as a renowned lawyer and politician it was unlikely he would have “excoriated” those professions. Marcus Tullius Cicero is considered one of Rome’s greatest orators.","https://archive.vn/ey1Ag,https://archive.vn/5jyhE,https://archive.vn/uWSG0,https://archive.vn/WFw7K,https://archive.vn/2CL7y,https://iep.utm.edu/cicero/#H3,https://iep.utm.edu/cicero/#H3,https://youtu.be/h13N2bxTGrs,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/people/full-time-staff/gesine-manuwald,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/classics/people/full-time-staff/gesine-manuwald,https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/13755.Marcus_Tullius_Cicero,https://www.brainyquote.com/search_results?q=cicero,http://occupywallst.org/forum/ciceros-theory-106-bc-43-bc-still-in-practice/,http://occupywallst.org/about/,http://occupywallst.org/users/benjamin/,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-Cicero-quotes/answer/Anuja-Kulkarni-Kumar,https://www.otago.ac.nz/classics/staff/otago056373.html,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-life-in-ciceros-letters/D30D52456E0BF89CC1984826ED4641F9,https://www.otago.ac.nz/classics/staff/otago054346.html,https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195329063.001.0001/acprof-9780195329063,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ciceros-view-of-life/",Marcus Cicero wrote many pithy quotes – but not the ones in this meme,,,,,,

The same image was later shared on the NZ Journal of Natural Medicine Facebook page, among other places.The post was on the Facebook page for Andrew W Saul, whose online bio states he is a New York-based author with a doctorate in “behavioral biology”.He has written a number of books advocating for the use of multivitamins to treat conditions such as alcoholism, depression and “women’s health problems”, and refers to himself as “the megavitamin man”.The caption accompanying the post’s image reads, “The sign is not my own, but I think it is a nice touch.” An image shared on Facebook says intravenous vitamin C doses can “stop” COVID-19. The AnalysisSince the outbreak of COVID-19, vitamin C products have been reportedly “flying off the shelves” as people seek to boost their immune systems during the pandemic.According to the US National Institute of Health (NIH), vitamin C plays an important role in the function of the immune system. It recommends adults consume between 75 and 90 milligrams a day (table 1), roughly the amount of the vitamin found in three-quarters of a cup of orange juice (table 2).But can an intravenous dose of vitamin C at hundreds of times this level – 20 to 30 grams – prevent COVID-19, as the post claims?Research on the use of high doses of intravenous (IV) vitamin C for a range of conditions suggest it may have benefits in some cases. But reviews into the use of vitamin C to treat COVID-19 have been mixed, and there is no evidence to suggest that high doses of IV vitamin C could prevent people from contracting the coronavirus altogether.A review of treatments for COVID-19 by Harvard Medical School pointed to earlier studies showing high doses of IV vitamin C may help treat sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which were were “the most common conditions leading to intensive care unit admission, ventilator support, or death among those with severe COVID-19 infections”.But it added “there is no evidence that taking vitamin C will help prevent infection” and high doses of vitamin C could cause nausea, cramps and an increased risk of kidney stones.A study published in PharmaNutrition in April looked at the potential for using high doses of IV vitamin C for treating ARDS in COVID-19 patients.It said vitamin C had shown benefits in reducing symptoms and mortality in some conditions (page 2) and “additional studies detailing the use of IV Vit-C for the treatment of severe Covid-19 infected pneumonia are definitely warranted” (page 6).A non-peer-reviewed overview of the effectiveness of treating COVID-19 with vitamin C by researchers from the University Hospital of Zurich was published in April. It found there was no scientific evidence that either oral or intravenous vitamin C was beneficial in treating the virus.Another review, published in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance in October, found high doses of vitamin C may “favourably impact patients with viral pneumonia and ARDS in severe SAR-CoV-2 infected patients”.Patients were recruited for a clinical trial in Wuhan, China, into the use of vitamin C for COVID-19 in February, however it didn’t reach its planned sample size as the city’s outbreak was brought under control and the number of qualifying patients available decreased.Researchers released a non-peer-reviewed preprint study in August after 27 critically ill COVID-19 patients were given 24g of IV vitamin C daily for a week.The study found the treatment “may provide a protective clinical effect without any adverse events in critically ill patients with COVID-19”.At least three other trials are underway – in Canada, the US and Italy – but their results are yet to be published.Meanwhile, in its series of COVID-19 “mythbusters”, the World Health Organisation notes vitamin C’s critical role in the immune system but adds there is no current guidance on its use as a treatment for the virus.The NIH’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines say the use of high-dose vitamin C in COVID-19 patients is being studied, but there is insufficient evidence on its effectiveness. They note there is “no compelling reason” for the use of vitamin C in non-critically ill patients as they were less likely to be experiencing severe inflammation.In Australia, the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care released a position statement in May on the use of high-dose IV vitamin C for COVID-19.It said the vitamin could support defences against infection but added there was “no robust scientific evidence to support the usage of high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in the management of severe cases of COVID-19”.In March, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) found there was “no evidence to support intravenous high-dose vitamin C in the management of COVID-19” and further research was needed.A spokesperson for the TGA told AAP FactCheck via email that “there remains insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous vitamin C in the management of COVID-19”.Magreet Vissers, a professor at the University of Otago’s Centre for Free Radical Research who specialises in the use of vitamin C in treating disease, said advocating a 30g intravenous dose to prevent COVID-19 was “a stupid thing to say”.“It’s one step above injecting yourself with bleach,” Prof Vissers said. “It’s probably not harmful but it’s not going to keep you safe.”She said a dose of about six to 10 grams of vitamin C each day could be beneficial for people who were critically ill as the body could become severely depleted of the vitamin, reducing the function of the immune system and other essential bodily processes.But Prof Vissers said people were generally able to maintain a saturation level of vitamin C through a healthy diet and taking a high dose of vitamin C intravenously would not help the body fight off COVID-19.University of Otago associate professor Anitra Carr also studies the role of vitamin C in human health, including in pneumonia and sepsis. She told AAP FactCheck via email “there is as yet no published data to indicate that high-dose IV vitamin C will prevent COVID-19”.She said the Wuhan study indicated vitamin C infusions could decrease mortality in the most severely ill COVID-19 patients, but noted the study had a small sample size and it was undergoing peer review.Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and researcher at the University of New South Wales, told AAP FactCheck via email that there was no evidence that taking large doses of vitamin C intravenously could stop the spread of COVID-19.Prof McLaws said there was evidence using IV vitamin C could help people with pneumonia caused by COVID-19, but it was “too early to determine the impact” until more research was conducted.Similar claims from Andrew Saul have been fact-checked as false here and here, while others relating to the use of vitamin C to treat COVID-19 have been debunked here and here. Experts say there’s no evidence high-dose injections of vitamin C help prevent COVID-19.","https://archive.vn/whcoF,https://archive.vn/Sb8gN,https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman/,https://andrewsaul.com/books-2/,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/coronavirus-vitamin-c-flying-off-the-shelves-but-does-it-boost-immunity/Z5RTWJLIX473O2S4IISRF4EZTE/,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/,https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/treatments-for-covid-19,https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(16)62564-3/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752063,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172861/pdf/main.pdf,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340660507_Effectiveness_of_vitamin_C_to_treat_COVID-19_an_overview,http://www.en.usz.ch/Pages/default.aspx,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716520302587,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04264533,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-52778/v1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04401150?term=intravenous+vitamin+c+high+dose&cond=covid-19&draw=2&rank=2,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04357782?term=NCT04357782&draw=2&rank=1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323514?term=NCT04323514&draw=2&rank=1,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#drugs,https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/adjunctive-therapy/vitamin-c/,https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-06/Covid-19%20-%20Position%20statement%20-%20Ascorbic%20Acid%20Intravenous%20high%20dose%20-%2012%20May%202020.PDF,https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/no-evidence-support-intravenous-high-dose-vitamin-c-management-covid-19,https://www.otago.ac.nz/free-radical/staff/margreet-vissers.html,https://www.otago.ac.nz/christchurch/departments/pathology/people/anitra-carr.html,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-marylouise-mclaws,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/fake-coronavirus-cures-part-3-vitamin-c-isnt-a-shield/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/29/facebook-posts/no-vitamin-c-cannot-slow-or-stop-spread-coronaviru/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-vitaminc-idUSKCN21X2PV,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/24/coronavirus-fact-check-could-vitamin-c-cure-covid-19/2904303001/",‘A step above injecting bleach’: Vitamin C cure for COVID-19 panned,,,,,,

That’s wrong. Permanently raise JobSeeker above the poverty-line now!” A post compares Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s salary to Australia’s unemployment benefits. The AnalysisWhile Scott Morrison is among the highest-paid elected leaders of countries in the developed world, he is not at the top of the heap. That honour goes to Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, who has led the city-state since 2004.Meanwhile, Mr Morrison, who has been Australian prime minister since August 2018, claimed during the lead-up to the 2019 poll that Australia had one of the best social-security safety nets – “if not the best” – of anywhere in the world, drawing renewed criticism of the $40-per-day unemployment benefit, then called Newstart.The rate has been unfavourably compared to the salaries and allowances enjoyed by federal politicians.Mr Morrison’s salary is made up of a base payment, determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, received by all parliamentarians, and an additional salary calculated as a percentage of the base.As of July 1, 2020, the base salary was $211,250, while the additional salary comes to $338,000 – taking the prime minister’s combined annual pay to $549,250, or just under $1505 per day.In comparison, the Singapore prime minister’s office reveals that Mr Lee receives a salary package, including bonuses, of SG$2.2 million ($2.29 million). The figure is based on a ministerial benchmark derived from the median income for Singapore’s top 1000 earners.A 2019 analysis by USA Today of the best-paid world leaders put Mr Morrison’s salary at the fifth-highest in the world. However three of the four leaders ahead of him in the list are not parliamentarians but head their government’s executive branches.They include US President Donald Trump, who is entitled to an annual salary of $US400,000 per year ($564,175) as well as an expense account of $US50,000. The pay packet for Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam is due to rise to a reported $HK5.21 million ($946,938) this year.Mr Morrison’s salary is also lower than that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who reportedly earns more than €340,000 per year ($568,132). Nevertheless, Mr Morrison’s salary compares favourably to that of many of his peers.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordinarly earns $NZ471,049 ($441,724) per year, although this was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Canadian leader Justin Trudeau earns $CA365,200 ($390,928) before allowances.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was entitled to a salary of £158,754 in 2019-20 ($293,880 at current exchange rates), based on the pay for his position in addition to the standard MP’s entitlement.Needless to say, a person on the JobSeeker unemployment benefit earns a fraction of the prime minister’s salary – receiving a base payment of $40.40 per day before the fortnightly COVID-19 supplement of $250, which is due to expire at the end of the year.Rent assistance of up to $139.60 per fortnight is also payable to eligible single people living alone, with lower payments for couples and those sharing accommodation.But does Australia have the lowest unemployment benefit in the developed world, as claimed in the post?Writing for Inside Story, Australian National University public policy professor Peter Whiteford noted that international comparisons are difficult because many countries use contributory insurance systems – in which unemployment payments are based on people’s past earnings.These tended to lead to higher payments during short periods out of work but lower benefits for the long-term unemployed, he said.There are several other countries with lower base unemployment benefits. In the UK, the maximum unemployment benefit is £74.35 ($137.56) for those aged 25 and over, or only $A19.65 per day. Those renting may also be entitled to rent supplements.In New Zealand, single people aged 25 and over can receive up to $NZ281.08 ($263.46) per week in unemployment benefits before tax, or $A37.64 per day. Weekly accommodation supplements of up to $NZ165 ($154.70) for singles are also available.In the United States, which largely relies on state-based systems of unemployment insurance, the minimum weekly payment rates fall to as low as $US5 ($7.05) in Hawaii, according to an analysis from USAFacts.org.However international comparisons that look at replacement rates – which compare unemployment benefits to workers’ previous incomes – put Australia at the bottom of the table.OECD data (see chart) shows that Australia ranks ahead of only Russia when benefits after two months of unemployment are measured against previous incomes. The figures are based on a single person earning two-thirds of the average wage.The relative situation improves for the long-term unemployed, whose benefits in Australia compare favourably to those available to the jobless in the US, Hungary and Czech Republic after six months out of work. For those out of work for five years, Australia’s replacement rate is above the OECD average.Prof Whiteford wrote in his analysis, which drew on the same figures, that including rent assistance, which about 40 per cent of people on Newstart receive, and the equivalent housing benefits in other countries made Australia’s replacement rate for the unemployed the lowest in the OECD.Research by Deloitte Access Economics in 2018 found that unemployment benefits in Australia had fallen relative to average wages, the minimum wage and the age pension over the past quarter of a century.Prof Whiteford told AAP FactCheck that the “absolute purchasing power” of Australia’s unemployment benefits was higher than countries such as the UK and New Zealand.“However, where I think replacement rates are important is in thinking about what the effects of losing your job are,” he said.“When you move from employment to being on benefit what is important in the short run is whether you can keep up your previous financial commitments – particularly your rent or mortgage.“So the drop in income is what is relevant here. And before the coronavirus supplement was introduced, the drop in income in Australia was greater than in any other high-income country.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earns $549,250 per year, or just under $1505 per day.","https://archive.vn/hpMYP,http://archive.vn/w0tXe,https://www.pmo.gov.sg/cabinet/mr-lee-hsien-loong,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=E3L,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-13/federal-election-newstart-allowance-you-ask-we-answer/11091150,https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2019/08/03/australian-politicians-newstart/,https://maps.finance.gov.au/guidance/remuneration/salary,https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/psd/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?qst=hRhkP9BzcBKnt75r%2Bl1bopmAANxUYJsZ1XtCavhh%2Bg8uifs%2FSSJBsHDTcHJB1%2FKdJEcaudLZZH80Azo7UxJvw21ao65qKq3tvdU1YT5vbbQ%2Bvz2gBNUuTEU9RYYbiXjcxxx1iuuCkEH58vl2LdFXxxSW45Ci62%2Fi#FAQ_34324,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/21/20-highest-paid-world-leaders-president-trump/39352195/,https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/102,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1518717-20200403.htm,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-4000-eu-officials-are-paid-more-than-merkel/,https://www.parliament.nz/media/6767/parliamentary-salaries-and-allowances-determination-2020.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-15/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-pay-cut/12150174,https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Salaries,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/811042/Salaries_of_Members_of_Her_Majesty_s_Government_April_2019.pdf,https://www.theipsa.org.uk/mp-costs/mps-pay-and-pensions/,https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment/how-much-you-can-get,https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/rent-assistance/how-much-you-can-get,https://insidestory.org.au/is-newstart-the-pace-setter-scott-morrison-says-it-is/?fbclid=IwAR0B2Z9OJfQQ3gVKh1IsLxgGfqSbsV5uf3XwhgZ_5LqvOeEWgp1T7LE-szc,https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/academic/peter-whiteford,https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance,https://www.gov.uk/housing-benefit/what-youll-get,https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/documents/deskfile/benefit-rate-summaries/benefitratesummary-2020-07-06.pdf,https://usafacts.org/articles/unemployment-benefits-by-state-and-county/,https://data.oecd.org/benwage/benefits-in-unemployment-share-of-previous-income.htm,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DAE-Analysis-of-the-impact-of-raising-benefit-rates-FINAL-4-September-...-1.pdf",Is Scott Morrison the highest paid leader while Australia’s jobless get the lowest benefits?,,,,,,

If you don’t want to be at the mercy of FOREIGN FORCES next ’emergency’ you must demand this component in the amendments of the Bill be stopped by tomorrow 5pm (Thursday 15th October 2020).”The post urges readers to lodge a submission opposing the amendment and includes a template detailing the user’s opposition and concerns about the law change.At the time of writing, the October 14 post has been viewed more than 53,000 times and shared more than 1800 times attracting more than 330 reactions and 170 comments. A social media post claims a Bill will allow the government to bring in foreign armies to Australia. The AnalysisIt’s true the Defence Bill provides some immunity to foreign forces when called on to help in case of emergencies.However, the proposed laws do not allow for unfettered actions from foreign forces without any criminal or civil liabilities. Instead, it brings their immunity provisions into line with those granted to Australia’s state and territory emergency-services personnel, according to legal experts.Australia experienced a raft of disasters in 2020, starting with devastating bushfires, followed by floods and the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight foreign nations provided military assistance during the 2019-20 bushfires, according to the Department of Defence.The Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of Defence Force Response to Emergencies) Bill 2020 was introduced into the House of Representatives on September 3.If passed into law, the Bill would amend the Defence Act 1903 to streamline the process for calling out Australian Defence Force (ADF) Reserves, and provide them, other Defence personnel and foreign forces with similar immunities to state emergency personnel when called out to deal with civil emergencies and disasters, according to an explanatory memorandum on the Bill.According to the Defence Assistance to the Civil Community Manual (see AL3, chapter 3), the Commonwealth government can already call on the ADF and foreign personnel to help in emergencies when “immediate action is necessary to save human life or alleviate suffering, prevent extensive loss of animal life, prevent widespread loss/damage to property or to prevent environmental damage, and when State/Territory resources are inadequate”.The Bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on October 8 for inquiry. The committee is due to report back by November 4.The post claims that if the Bill passed into law, a minister would be able to bring in foreign armies to “control Australians with complete immunity from criminal and civil liability”.University of South Australia professor Jennifer McKay, an expert in environmental laws during times of conflict, told AAP FactCheck the post was alarmist and its claim of “complete immunity” is “too wide”.“(Under the Bill), Defence personnel and members of foreign forces will have similar immunities to state and territory emergency services personnel,” Prof McKay said.“Those immunities are generally that these people can damage private property in order to preserve life. They can’t kill people, but they can commandeer a truck or back burn on somebody’s land in order to protect the greater good.”Professor Natalie Klein, an international law expert at UNSW Sydney, told AAP FactCheck in an email it is unlikely that foreign armies would be granted absolute immunity from civil or criminal jurisdiction.“In relation to foreign armies, if anything, immunities would be accorded only in relation to conduct that is undertaken in the performance of official duties. That seems to be in line with the language in the Bill,” Prof Klein said.“Typically, any atrocity, such as a war crime, would not be considered as performance of official duties.”Under Section 123AA (1) of the Bill, a “protected person” is “not subject to any liability (whether civil or criminal) in respect of anything the protected person does or omits to do, in good faith, in the performance or purported performance of the protected person’s duties”.The immunity condition only applies when the duties are carried out to assist either the ADF or Defence Department in preparing for or responding to a natural disaster or other emergency.Prof McKay said if Defence or foreign forces acted in “bad faith in any way then they lose that immunity immediately”.“They would be civilly liable just like the police would be if they were to hit you too hard or are unreasonable in what they do. It becomes an assault.”A spokesperson for the Department of Defence told AAP FactCheck via email that the Bill would not expand on or change the government’s power to deploy the ADF or foreign forces in response to natural disasters and other emergencies.Eight nations already provided military support to Australia, through the ADF, during the 2019-20 bushfire crisis, the spokesperson said.“(The laws do not) authorise ADF members or others (including foreign forces) to use force or coercive powers against members of the Australian community,” they said.However ADF members and foreign personnel who acted in good faith in the course of their duties – such as in the event of a member of the public being accidentally injured during assistance – would be afforded immunity, similar to that afforded to state and territory emergency responders.“The Bill does not make the Commonwealth itself immune from prosecution,” the spokesperson said. An Australian Army soldier clearing shed remains after bushfires in South Australia in February.","https://archive.vn/KPbaR,https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Australian%20bushfires_Final.pdf,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146284/extreme-rain-douses-fires-causes-floods-in-australia,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6594,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r6594_ems_9fe3f627-9bf3-4423-8248-98e7ef57e242/upload_pdf/746860.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf,https://emergencylaw.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/dacc-manual.pdf,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/ADFResponseBill2020,https://people.unisa.edu.au/Jennifer.McKay,https://www.law.unsw.edu.au/staff/natalie-klein,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r6594_first-reps/toc_pdf/20117b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf",Defence law change won’t give foreign forces ‘complete’ immunity in Australia,,,,,,
90,,,,Partly False,,2020-10-22,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/are-aborted-babies-being-used-for-a-covid-19-vaccine/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims “aborted babies” are being used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.The post, from August 26, states: “Aborted babies are being used for the vaccine you all are waiting for.” It is accompanied by a video of Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, speaking at a press conference on August 24.In the video, Dr Coatsworth addresses a question about ethical concerns regarding the use of cells derived from aborted fetuses in developing a leading COVID-19 vaccine.Dr Coatsworth said he was aware of concerns that “the particular cell line that was produced for the vaccine was from an ethically aborted human fetus”, adding that the use of human cells was an important part of developing vaccines.The Facebook post is from a user who lists their location as Melbourne. At the time of publication, it had been shared more than 6,600 times and attracted more than 970 reactions and 800 comments. The video had been viewed 194,000 times. The post features a video of Dr Nick Coatsworth discussing a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The AnalysisThe press conference featured in the Facebook post followed Australian religious leaders raising concerns that cells derived from aborted fetuses were being used for a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, commonly referred to as the “Oxford vaccine”.On August 19, the Australian government announced it had reached an agreement with AstraZeneca to secure access to the Oxford vaccine if trials proved successful.The following day, Anglican archbishop Glenn Davies, Catholic archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia archbishop Makarios wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison raising concerns about the use of cells derived from an aborted fetus in the development of the vaccine.The letter states the religious leaders are disappointed the government has “thrown its lot in” with a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that involves the HEK-293 cell line, cultivated from an aborted human fetus.The leaders write that a portion of the population will have an issue with the use of fetal cells and they ask that the vaccine not be made mandatory, while also requesting that an “ethically uncontroversial alternative vaccine be made available”.Dr Coatsworth addressed these concerns during a press conference on August 24, video of which was shared on the Department of Health’s social media channels.In the 74-second snippet of the press conference included in the Facebook post, Dr Coatsworth says human cells were needed to develop vaccines, including the Oxford vaccine, and “we can have every faith” the vaccine has been developed using “the highest of ethical standards internationally”.AAP FactCheck found the video in the Facebook post had not been altered from the original or edited in a misleading way.So, are “aborted babies” being used to develop COVID-19 vaccines?University of Auckland vaccinologist and associate professor Helen Petousis-Harris is chair of the World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.Dr Petousis-Harris told AAP FactCheck via email that “aborted babies are not being used for the development of COVID-19 vaccines”.However, she said human cells were required in order to grow the COVID-19 virus when developing certain vaccines as using these was the fastest and most reliable way to study human pathogens.Dr Petousis-Harris said some cell lines, established decades ago, were derived from cells from electively aborted fetuses and these lines are used in both medical research and the production of some vaccines. These include common vaccines for hepatitis A, rubella, chickenpox and rabies.She said the cells used to develop vaccines are not the originally harvested cells but distant descendants of those cells. No cells of any kind are part of the final vaccine formulation.Dr Petousis-Harris said the Oxford vaccines used HEK-293 cells to grow the vaccine and the developers have published details of the manufacturing process that make clear this information.She said the HEK-293 cells were derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The line was developed in scientist Alex van der Eb’s Dutch laboratory in about 1973 from cells taken from a single fetus.Prof van der Eb told a US Food and Drug Agency hearing in 2001 that the kidney cells were likely obtained in 1972 from an electively aborted fetus, and he did not know the reason for the abortion (page 81).Dr Petousis-Harris said other COVID-19 vaccines were being developed from different human cell lines established in the 1960s, while some COVID-19 vaccines would not require human cell lines at all.“That said, all vaccines will have benefited during some stage of development from the use of human cell lines because studying the virus and immune responses in the lab inevitably use these cell lines to ensure reliable results that are relevant to humans,” she said.An article co-authored by Professor Megan Munsie, research fellow Dr Chris Gyngell and Associate Professor Michelle Taylor-Sands, all from the University of Melbourne,  investigated ethical issues relating to the Oxford vaccine.The article said the Oxford vaccine was manufactured using the HEK-293 cell line “as ‘factories’ to make the component of the vaccine that carries genes from the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the aim of triggering an immune response to protect the recipient when injected”.The article said there were six COVID-19 vaccines being developed that used human fetal cell lines. The use of fetal cell lines was “ubiquitous” in medical research, the article added.It reiterated that the cells used to manufacture the Oxford vaccine were laboratory-cultivated “descendants” of the cells originally obtained in the 1970s from an aborted fetus, and the vaccine itself would contain neither fetal cells nor fetal DNA.An article in Science Mag has also detailed the use of fetal cells in vaccine development and found at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates used one of two human fetal cell lines: the HEK-193 cell line, and the PER.C6 cell line developed in 1985. Several potential COVID-19 vaccines use cell lines derived from an aborted fetus.","https://archive.vn/PkPJS,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/government-response-to-the-covid-19-outbreak/our-medical-experts#dr-nick-coatsworth,https://www.ox.ac.uk/coronavirus,https://www.astrazeneca.com.au/,https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Area/coronavirus-research/vaccine,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/new-deal-secures-potential-covid-19-vaccine-every-australian,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-24/sydney-catholic-archbishop-warns-pm-against-coronavirus-vaccine/12588578,https://sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/Archbishops_to_PM_re_COVID_vaccine_with_attachments.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01YQ2_V6lqM&feature=youtu.be&t=188,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/hpet002,https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/current_members_June_2020.pdf?ua=1,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00300/full,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17972-1,https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/4073,https://web.archive.org/web/20170516050447/https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/01/transcripts/3750t1_01.pdf,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/gaining-clarity-on-the-ethical-issues-of-a-possible-covid-19-vaccine,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/379400-megan-munsie,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/811748-christopher-gyngell,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/28463-michelle-taylor-sands,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/abortion-opponents-protest-covid-19-vaccines-use-fetal-cells",Are ‘aborted babies’ being used for a COVID-19 vaccine?,,,,,,

The lengthy post, quoting Dr Griesz-Brisson, makes the central claim that rebreathing exhaled air when using a mask will “create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide”.The post, which has been shared by New Zealand Facebook users, was originally posted by this Facebook user. At the time of publication it had been shared more than 2100 times. A Facebook post claims face masks cause oxygen deprivation and permanent neurological damage. The AnalysisCan using a face mask deprive the brain of oxygen and cause carbon-dioxide flooding? Not according to the World Health Organization, which debunked the “myth” in June.“The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency,” WHO says on its website.The health agency does say, however, that children aged five and under shouldn’t be required to wear masks, while mask-use among those aged between six and 11 should be based on factors such as local transmission levels, adult supervision and the potential impact of wearing a mask on learning development.AAP FactCheck examined the two main claims in the Facebook post: that mask use can create an oxygen deficiency and that it can cause a harmful flooding of carbon dioxide.Research published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society this month directly addresses the effect of masks on gas exchange in healthy people and those with lung disease.The research tested CO2 levels and oxygen saturation before and after wearing a surgical mask on 15 physicians without lung conditions and 15 veterans with severe respiratory disease, such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis and chronic asthma.It found that “gas exchange is not significantly affected by the use of surgical mask, even in subjects with severe lung impairment” (page 3).Dunedin pathologist Dr Ling Chan, a co-author on a NZ Medical Journal report on the use of masks in COVID-19 infection control, told AAP FactCheck there was no evidence that mask-wearing increased carbon dioxide intake.“The CO2 would pass through the gaps ’round the side and through the face covering as CO2 (molecules are) much smaller than the fabric/mask materials,” Dr Chan said.On the question of whether masks cause low oxygen levels, pulmonologist Dr David G Hill rejected the claim in a blog post for the American Lung Association.“Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur,” he wrote.He did acknowledge that prolonged use of N-95 masks, which filter at least 95 per cent of airborne particles, could be detrimental to patients with pre-existing lung disease, but that “there is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask-wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system”.In a video posted to Twitter, a Dublin-based doctor debunked the claim that masks can lower oxygen levels by putting on six masks while measuring the oxygen saturation levels in his blood.“I managed to get six face masks on + it had no effect on my oxygen levels!” Dr Maitiu O Tuathail tweeted.Dr Michael Niederman, a pulmonologist with New York-based Weill Cornell Medicine, told Associated Press that wearing masks does not decrease oxygen levels, nor does it increase carbon dioxide levels. “There’s no evidence that I know of that they are going to harm anyone.”UNSW Sydney epidemiologist Dr Abrar Ahmad Chughtai told AAP FactCheck it was important to differentiate between N-95 respirators used by health care professionals and disposal cloth masks worn by the public.One study showed that N-95 masks don’t lead to increased physiological burdens when used by healthcare workers, however it did find increased carbon-dioxide levels and reduced oxygen inside the “dead space” between the mask and the wearer’s face.“N-95s seal around your face so that there is no leakage,” Dr Chughtai said during a phone interview.“Prolonged use of N-95, technically, yes, some CO2 can accumulate. After, for example, two hours, that’s why we say health care workers should take some rest.“But with general surgical masks and cloth masks there is no evidence, and it is almost impossible.” Wearing a face mask does not decrease oxygen levels, experts told AAP FactCheck.","http://archive.today/6Hm5X,https://www.doctify.com/uk/specialist/dr_margareta_griesz_brisson_md_phd,https://www.facebook.com/hennamaria22/posts/1448632362193051,https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/mythbuster-masks,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19,https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202007-812RL,http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202007-812RL,https://twitter.com/drlingchan,https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/mass-masking-an-alternative-to-a-second-lockdown-in-aotearoa,https://www.lung.org/about-us/our-leadership/david-g-hill,https://www.lung.org/blog/covid-masks,https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks,https://archive.is/NjopT,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-maitiu-o-tuathail-a9a6691a3,https://weillcornell.org/mneiderman,https://apnews.com/article/9091960069,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-abrar-ahmad-chughtai,https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20420727/",Face mask oxygen-deprivation claims are a lot of hot air,,,,,,

TOO MUCH MCDONALDS HEY?”The 28-second video pans across tens of thousands of people waving Spanish flags in a plaza and surrounding streets as the country’s national anthem plays in the background.The original post’s caption, written in Italian, translates to: “SPAIN MADRID. MANIFESTATION (demonstration) AGAINST (the) HEALTH SYSTEM AND NEW WORLD ORDER.”At the time of writing, the original post has been shared more than 14,000 times and attracted more than 1800 reactions. A video on Facebook purportedly shows Spaniards demonstrating against the country’s health regime. The AnalysisSpain is in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19 cases with restrictions across the country. However, the video claimed to show protests against Spain’s health system and the “new world order” is more than 18 months old and relates to the government’s plan to meet with Catalan separatists.Spain was one of the countries hit hardest during the first wave of COVID-19 cases. While it had started to regain control of the spread, the country is now experiencing a second wave of infections. A state of emergency was declared in Madrid on October 9 and a partial lockdown imposed.The video was posted in August alongside the claim it showed protests against the “health system” as COVID-19 cases rose and the government introduced fresh restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.However, AAP FactCheck traced the video back to a tweet of a protest in Madrid on February 10, 2019. The footage was taken overlooking the Plaza de Colón in Madrid.Thousands took to the streets on that date to demand Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez call a snap general election after he proposed discussions with Catalan separatists to try and ease tensions.The protests were led by right-leaning political parties in support of Spanish unity after they deemed the talks to be “a betrayal and a surrender to pressure from Catalan separatists”, according to a New York Times article.Catalonia, one of Spain’s autonomous regions, has been home to a strong independence movement for decades.Catalan governments have held two referendums on succession, in contravention of the Spanish constitution, the second of which was held in 2017 and led to a declaration of independence.Several independence leaders were jailed in October 2019 for their roles in the failed succession bid, while others fled into exile.The video included in the Facebook post was previously verified by Spanish fact-checkers Newtral and Italy’s Facta, both of which confirmed it showed protests on February 10, 2019, against the Spanish national government’s proposed dealings with Catalan separatists.Another video of the 2019 protest from a different angle at the same location can be seen here. Thousands protest against Spanish government and Catalan pro-independence talks on February 10, 2019.","https://archive.is/u9DUs,https://archive.vn/u5Lqp,https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/spain?country=~ESP,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30239-5/fulltext,https://boe.es/boe/dias/2020/10/09/index.php?d=268,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/state-of-emergency-in-madrid-as-europe-s-covid-19-cases-jump-by-28-per-cent-in-a-week,https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-11590,https://twitter.com/angel_munarriz/status/1094590200871821312,https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/plaza-colon?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F,https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/presidente/biografia/Paginas/index.aspx,https://archive.is/O1ovY,https://www.spain.info/en/query/autonomous-regions-spain/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-independence-what-is-the-story-what-happens-next,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/29/the-referendum-in-catalonia-explained/,https://www.elnacional.cat/en/editorial/jose-antich-six-months-declaration-independence_263091_102.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences,https://www.newtral.es/verificamos-los-videos-que-circulan-sobre-la-manifestacion-en-colon/20190211/,https://facta.news/fuori-contesto/2020/09/30/questo-video-e-stato-girato-in-spagna-ma-la-covid-19-non-centra/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIRkuF_SV8g",Video shows huge Madrid protest – but it’s not over COVID-19,,,,,,

He was first elected to the state parliament in the seat of Mulgrave in 2002.The Facebook post claims information about the premier’s net worth was sourced from Wikipedia, Forbes and IMDb, but AAP FactCheck found no evidence that these sources provide any information about his wealth.The Victorian premier’s Wikipedia entry makes no mention of his net worth, only including a line about a salary increase in 2019.That year, Mr Andrews became the highest-paid state leader in Australia after the Victorian Independent Remuneration Tribunal increased his total salary and allowances to $441,439. This consisted of the base salary of $182,413 received by all the state’s MPs, an additional premier’s salary of $203,542 and an expense allowance of $55,484.Assuming Mr Andrews paid tax on the full sum, he would be left with an after-tax income of $269,594 based on rates for the 2019-20 financial year. If he were to continue on that income, it would take the premier more than 337 years to amass a fortune of $91 million.AAP FactCheck also found no information relating to the premier’s net worth on the Forbes website nor on his listing on film information site IMDb.However, the text in the Facebook image matches wording used on the website Trend Celebs Now, although the site’s name is missing from the post. Under a heading ‘Daniel Andrews  (sic) Net Worth’, the website lists the premier’s net worth and annual salary as “under review”.Members of the Victorian parliament are required to submit regular returns detailing financial and other interests that are relevant to their public roles. Under the relevant laws, anyone who breaches the disclosure rules can be held in contempt of the state parliament, fined or even pursued for criminal charges.According to the most recent Register of Interests, dated July 28, Mr Andrews’ only asset was his home in Mulgrave in Melbourne’s southeast (page 29). According to the Herald-Sun, Mr Andrews bought a house in Mulgrave in 2002 for around $251,000, although in 2016 the newspaper put its value at “closer to $1 million”.The median sale price for a three-bedroom home in Mulgrave during the past 12 months is $826,000, according to Domain. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews lists his only asset as a home in the Melbourne suburb of Mulgrave.","https://archive.vn/326As ,https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/about/people-in-parliament/members-search/search-members/details/22/37,https://archive.vn/6W92w,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/victorian-premier-to-become-highest-paid-state-leader-pay-rise/11520214,https://www.vic.gov.au/tribunals-determination-mp-salaries-and-allowances#determination-in-effect,https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Host/?anchor=STC&anchor=STC#STC/questions,https://www.forbes.com/search/?sort=recent&q=Daniel%20Andrews,https://archive.vn/5zEWw,https://trendcelebsnow.com/daniel-andrews-net-worth/,https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/publications/register-of-interests,https://content.legislation.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/cc334b5e-583b-3e72-b51b-cdd92753d54a_78-9223aa005%20authorised.pdf,https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/file_uploads/LA_Ordinary_Returns_28_July_20_vol_1_TnjHYtGQ.pdf,https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/page-13-premier-daniel-andrews-bulldozes-mulgrave-family-home/news-story/ea214a51637cc803c90d7045878e6cd9,https://www.domain.com.au/suburb-profile/mulgrave-vic-3170",Is Daniel Andrews really a multimillionaire?,,,,,,

I’m sure that’s the message we are all getting from the media.”The caption on the Instagram post adds: “It must be getting harder for the branch covidians to cling on to the biggest fraud in human history. The thing is, the stats don’t lie. Just the media does.”At the time of publication, the post had been viewed around 13,200 times, attracting more than 450 likes. A post claims the US is on track for fewer deaths in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The AnalysisWhile some of the figures included in the tweet are accurate, the tally of 2020 deaths in the United States is well below the true count, according to data provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The post also fails to take into consideration seasonal factors when wrongly concluding that the US was likely to record fewer deaths in 2020 than previous years.The figures in the tweet all appear to have been drawn from CDC data. In its report, Mortality in the United States, 2018, released in January 2020, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) said 2,839,205 resident deaths had been registered in the US that year.Provisional counts for 2019 show there had been 2,855,000 deaths recorded in the 12 months ending in December. The CDC told AAP FactCheck via email that final 2019 death data will not be available until later in 2020.The tweet, posted to Twitter on September 25, adds that there were 2,033,736 deaths in the United States in 2020 “through Sep 24th”.This tally, however, is significantly below the closest equivalent figure provided by the CDC, which told AAP FactCheck its provisional records showed 2,309,502 deaths in the US in 2020 up to and including September 19.The tweet’s claim that the US is on track for fewer deaths in 2020 than previous years appears to be based on comparing the daily death rates for each year.For the year up to and including September 24, the 2020 daily death rate stood at 7,589, based on the figure provided in the tweet.If the US were to record the same death rate throughout 2020, a leap year, as it had purportedly recorded to September 24, there would be 2,777,416 deaths – lower than the 2018 and 2019 tallies.However the annual tally based on the CDC’s updated figure of 2,309,502 to September 19, which is in line with its weekly provisional death counts, would provide a daily death rate of 8,771 and an annual toll of 3,213,984 for 2020 – significantly higher than for either 2018 or 2019.The apparent calculation to produce the tweet’s claim also fails to take into account the highly seasonal nature of the death data. In 2017, according to the CDC, the average daily number of deaths in December was 16.6 per cent higher than in July.The figures bottom out in summer and steadily rise from September until the end of the year. Based on this trend, the daily death rate would be expected to accelerate through the remainder of 2020.The NCHS has its own provisional tally of deaths from all causes – and how these compared to “expected deaths” using figures from an average of the equivalent periods in 2017 to 2019.The tally showed there were 11 per cent more deaths than expected in the US by the week ending October 10. The CDC notes that the deaths reported in the tally are only those recorded by the date of analysis, not all those that would have occurred.Due to this, it is likely to underestimate the total number of deaths and the rate of unexpected deaths.The CDC said research on the “excess deaths” could provide more information about the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.This research estimated that the weekly rate of excess deaths in the US peaked at as high as 40 per cent of the normal tally in April 2020 (see graph).Research from academics at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and the Yale School of Public Health found there were around 20 per cent more deaths in the US between the start of March and August than would normally be expected.The research noted that deaths attributed to COVID-19 only accounted for only two-thirds of the excess figure.The study’s lead author, Steven Woolf, told VCU News: “Contrary to sceptics who claim that COVID-19 deaths are fake or that the numbers are much smaller than we hear on the news, our research and many other studies on the same subject show quite the opposite.”The claim in the tweet the US is on track for a lower death rate in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic has also been debunked here and here. Experts say the US will likely record hundreds of thousands of “excess deaths” this year.","https://archive.vn/LvgXe,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm,https://archive.is/P5rH5,https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-Select-Causes/muzy-jte6/data,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6826a5.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771761,https://societyhealth.vcu.edu/about/staff/,https://news.vcu.edu/article/Total_deaths_recorded_during_the_pandemic_far_exceed_those_attributed,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/10/fact-check-no-proof-that-2020-will-end-with-fewer-total-us-deaths-than-2018-and-2019.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-death-count-stable-idUSKBN22Q2MT",The US isn’t headed for fewer deaths in 2020 with COVID-19,,,,,,

There are multiple preventative vaccines for flu and whooping cough, and there are effective treatments for diphtheria and tuberculosis.Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist and a member of the New Zealand government’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group, noted that COVID-19 is a new, fast-spreading virus that is “highly infectious and relatively dangerous”.“Because (COVID-19) is a new virus, most people are not immune, so it has the potential to infect a large proportion of the world’s population resulting in a high burden of death and disease,” told told AAP FactCheck in an email.“Masks are one of the few tools we have available to limit transmission of this virus between people, hence their widespread use.”Patricia Priest, an associate professor of Epidemiology at the University of Otago and also a member of the COVID-19 advisory group, said mask-wearing can slow the spread of COVID-19 to prevent healthcare networks from being overwhelmed.“It’s because of the wider context – i.e. the number of cases (and associated impacts) that would result from this virus spreading widely in a fully susceptible population,” she told AAP FactCheck.“With influenza, for example, there is a vaccine which reduces the risk of infection in a large proportion of the population and so the impact of masks as a protection is arguably less important.”The Instagram post includes a reference to tuberculosis, which is one of the top-10 causes of death worldwide and in 2019 was the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Tuberculosis is spread by a bacterium, not a virus, and is also curable.“Respiratory infections such as TB fortunately don’t cause fast-moving pandemics,” Prof Baker told AAP FactCheck.The CDC has also recommended that anyone suspected of having seasonal influenza wear a mask in healthcare settings until they can isolate to prevent spreading the infection.“Masks have also been widely used by the public in some societies for decades to protect themselves from infections, particularly at times where people are in crowded environments such as public transport,” Prof Baker said.“For less-serious respiratory infections, such as rhinoviruses that cause many common colds, mass masking would not usually be justified.”Even before COVID-19, mask-wearing was common in parts of Asia, notably in Japan and also China during the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The wearing of masks can even traced back as far as a 1910 Manchurian plague in China.Similar claims comparing mask-wearing responses for tuberculosis and COVID-19 have been debunked here, here and here. An epidemiologist told AAP FactCheck that mask-wearing helps slow the spread of COVID-19.","https://archive.is/Y4C3s,https://archive.is/ncIsy,https://www.facebook.com/PeopleOfTheUnitedStatees/photos/a.2303055413094761/3493287937404830/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/KDBxxx/status/1296020578613301248/photo/1,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-on-covid-19-for-older-people#:~:text=While%20some%20western%2C%20traditional,research%20results%20become%20available.,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/different-flu-vaccines.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pertussis/index.html,https://www.immune.org.nz/diseases/diphtheria,https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024831.html,https://www.health.govt.nz/about-ministry/leadership-ministry/expert-groups/covid-19-technical-advisory-group,https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm/people/expertise/profile/index.html?id=784,https://www.health.govt.nz/about-ministry/leadership-ministry/expert-groups/covid-19-technical-advisory-group,https://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/tb19_Exec_Sum_12Nov2019.pdf?ua=1,https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/tuberculosis-disease,https://www.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis#tab=tab_3,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/maskguidance.htm,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/07/04/national/science-health/japans-history-wearing-masks-coronavirus/,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2014.923815?src=recsys&,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01459740.2017.1423072,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/comparisons-of-tuberculosis-and-flu-with-covid-19-omit-important-context-that-explains-the-different-public-health-responses/?fbclid=IwAR2A6XLMNRWF3w_MuVEhBbS0FgUds6rNrCJLmFF1tFLal5wFPmFgYGZGoL0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/18/viral-image/post-misleads-about-covid-19-using-tuberculosis-da/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-covid-tb-idUSKCN25F16X",COVID-19 disease comparison masks vital differences,,,,,,

I’m going to trade my mask in for a helmet.”At the time of writing, the post has been viewed more than 18,000 times, attracting more than 200 shares and 250 reactions. A Facebook post suggests an approaching asteroid is more of a threat than COVID-19. The AnalysisAn asteroid, named 2018VP1, is predicted to approach Earth on November 2, 2020, with a 0.41 per cent chance it will enter the atmosphere, according to NASA. However, the US space agency says there is no chance it will strike the planet’s surface intact as it would disintegrate before then.NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) monitors near-Earth objects (NEO) in space and predicts close approaches to the planet, producing assessments of impact probabilities over the next century.The center’s earth impact monitor says the cumulative “impact probability” for asteroid 2018VP1, which has an estimated diameter of 2 metres, is 0.41 per cent – not 0.042 per cent as stated in the Facebook post.In a tweet, NASA Asteroid Watch described the object as “very small” and posing no threat to Earth.“It currently has a 0.41% chance of entering our planet’s atmosphere, but if it did, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size,” the tweet said.Dr Paul Chodas, the director of CNEOS, told AAP FactCheck via email that the Facebook meme was incorrect on several counts and implied danger where there was none.He said the term “impact probability” as used by NASA meant “impact into the Earth’s atmosphere”.“The asteroid in question is extremely tiny which means that even if it does impact, it will disintegrate into dust as it streaks through the atmosphere, producing at most a little shower of small meteorites. There is no chance this asteroid would reach the surface intact.”The post claims the chance of dying from COVID-19 is 0.026 per cent, however it is unclear what this figure represents.Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong, told AAP FactCheck in an email he had never heard a death rate claim of 0.026 per cent which he said was “extremely low and definitely wrong”.There are several ways that the risk of dying from COVID-19 can be assessed. Three key figures are the infection fatality rate (IFR), case fatality rate (CFR) and crude mortality rate (CMR).IFR measures the number of deaths as a proportion of all COVID-19 infections, including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases, and can show how likely it is that someone who becomes infected with COVID-19 will die.It is also increasingly being used as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19 by both policy-makers and the general public, according to a review in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.Mr Meyerowitz-Katz told AAP FactCheck it was difficult to arrive at a single accurate figure for IFR, but it had been shown the rate increased exponentially with age – from less than one in 10,000 at age 20 to nearly one in three at 85.His meta-analysis of IFRs for COVID-19 produced the aggregate figure of 0.68 per cent. This represents the purported chance of anyone who becomes infected with COVID-10 dying as a result of the virus.In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use a “current best estimate” of IFR for planning purposes (table 1) ranging from 0.00003 for those aged under 20;  0.0002 for those aged between 20-49 years; 0.005 for those aged 50-69 years; and for 70+ year age bracket, 0.054.However, the above figures are ratios, and need to be multiplied by 100 to get a percentage –  making it 0.003 per cent for those aged under 20, to 5.4 per cent for people aged 70 and older.An analysis published in the British Medical Journal (page 1) in August predicted COVID-19 IFRs for 187 countries based on their demographics, likelihood of comorbidities existing and health system capacities. Its estimates ranged from 0.43 per cent for countries in western sub-Saharan Africa to 1.45 per cent in Eastern Europe.In contrast, CFR is the proportion of deaths among those confirmed as having the illness. The World Health Organization identifies several flaws with the use of CFR as a metric during a pandemic, noting that it is generally used at the end of an outbreak after all cases were resolved.For example, in counting only confirmed cases and confirmed deaths it does not capture those currently infected who may later die from the illness. It also does not account for anyone who died with an undiagnosed case.The Johns Hopkins University Mortality Analyses placed Australia’s CFR at 3.3 per cent on October 15, while in US the rate was 2.7 per cent and in the United Kingdom it was 6.6 per cent.CMR looks at the deaths as a percentage of the entire population, including those who haven’t contracted the virus.According to Boston University’s School of Public Health, there are limitations in using crude rates as they don’t take into account confounding factors such as age or location. It also can’t be used to accurately predict the chance of future deaths in an ongoing pandemic as the final tally of fatalities is unknown.In Australia, for example, the crude mortality rate for COVID-19 stood at 0.0035 per cent based on the country’s coronavirus death toll and estimated population on October 15. In the US it stood at 0.065 per cent, using figures from John Hopkins University and a census estimate. NASA says an asteroid has a 0.41 per cent chance of hitting the Earth’s atmosphere as it nears on November 2.","https://archive.vn/efcA6 ,https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/cneos.html ,https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=2018%20VP1,https://twitter.com/AsteroidWatch/status/1297576303206576133,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/gideon-meyerowitz-katz,https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#what-do-we-know-about-the-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32180-9/fulltext,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6 ,https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32180-9/fulltext ,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html,https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/5/9/e003094.full.pdf ,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality ,https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#what-do-we-know-about-the-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19 ,https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_StandardizedRates/EP713_StandardizedRates2.html  ,https://archive.vn/jaaVJ,https://archive.vn/SubvG,https://archive.vn/JvFOk,https://archive.vn/snSLf",Is there more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth than dying from COVID-19?,,,,,,
97,,,,Ambiguous,,2020-10-16,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/evidence-on-nzs-carbon-emissions-far-from-clear/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Have New Zealand’s carbon emissions increased over the past three years under the Labour-led government? The Statement“Actually our carbon emissions have gone up in the last three years, not down.”Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 30, 2020.The AnalysisIn 2017, the Labour Party campaigned on making climate change a priority if it were in government, but three years on the National Party says greenhouse emissions have actually increased in New Zealand.During Labour’s 2017 campaign launch, party leader Jacinda Ardern called climate change “my generation’s nuclear free moment”, citing NZ’s 33-year-old nuclear free policy which is often viewed as a defining moment in its history.However during the Newshub Leaders Debate on September 30, National Party leader Judith Collins said the government had made no progress on reducing carbon emissions. (Video mark 1hr 8min 45secs).“Actually our carbon emissions have gone up in the last three years, not down,” Ms Collins said. “So all the talk, all the fluffing around about emergencies, tell you what, actually it’s got worse not better under this particular leader.”AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins’ statement that carbon emissions increased during the past three years under the Labour coalition government.Ms Collins’ office told AAP FactCheck her statement was based on net emissions figures from the Ministry for the Environment, released in December 2019, which included recorded greenhouse gas levels from 1990 to 2017 and projected greenhouse gas levels from 2018 to 2050.The figures show net greenhouse gas emissions were 56.895 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2-e) in 2017 and were projected to increase 17 per cent to 66.597Mt CO2-e in 2020 (see Data file, tables ‘Estimated historical’ and ‘Projected’).Net emissions account for forestry and land use changes that can remove, and add, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Gross emissions were expected to stay about the same, rising 0.09 per cent from 80.853Mt CO2-e in 2017 to 80.928Mt CO2-e in 2020.The historical figures show gross emissions have changed little since 2001, rising and falling between 78Mt CO2-e and 83Mt CO2-e, and were predicted to decline steadily from 2020.Recorded net emissions show rates have varied between 54Mt and 57Mt CO2-e since 2012, while the projections show net emissions were expected to increase until 2025 and then steadily decline.The figures were released as part of the Fourth Biennial Report, which outlines NZ’s progress on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.A summary of the report said net emissions were expected to increase in the short term as forestry planted in the late 1980s and early 1990s was harvested, but noted that projections were “inherently uncertain” (page 3).The figures were updated in April this year as part of a report, New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2018, which included recorded figures for 2018. These show gross emissions were expected to decline slightly overall, from 79.6Mt CO2-e in 2017, to 78.9 Mt CO2-e in 2020.Figures accompanying the report show recorded net emissions declined slightly between 2017 and 2018, from 56.93Mt CO2-e to 55.468Mt CO2-e. Gross emissions had also declined slightly, from 79.64Mt CO2-e to 78.862Mt CO2-e.A summary of the report notes (Page 1): “Gross emissions in 2018 were one per cent lower than 2017 levels and net emissions were three per cent lower. This is mainly due to a decline in emissions from manufacturing and construction, and public electricity and heat production; and a reduced rate of  deforestation and an increase in the production of harvested wood products.”The report did not include updated projections of net greenhouse emissions.However, a report released by the Ministry for the Environment in June, which reviewed the proposed settings of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), said emissions were expected to decline in 2020 due to COVID-19.The report found “emissions from many sectors will be substantially suppressed in the short-term” due to COVID-19 lockdowns and emissions could also be reduced in the medium to long term “if any major industrial facilities close and/or international tourism fails to rebound” (page 32). But it noted “there is substantial uncertainty at this stage about both the duration and severity of the COVID-19 impact” (page 32).The ministry produced three emissions scenarios to model the impact of COVID-19 between 2020 and 2025 and all show a significant decrease in emissions in 2020 (page 33).Massey University emeritus professor Ralph Sims told AAP FactCheck that “gross emissions have been fairly stable since 2012 and net emissions declined slightly from 2013 to 2018 but tend to fluctuate greatly with land use change that is hard to measure”.Prof Sims said projections were “anybody’s guess at the time and don’t mean much” and the impact of COVID-19 would make any earlier projections “null and void” due to the impact of lockdowns on transport and industry.He said recorded figures were also retrospectively changed as more information was gathered, making even recent figures somewhat uncertain.Victoria University of Wellington physical geography professor James Renwick, a leading researcher on climate change, said it was difficult to assess the record of the government over the past three years due to the lag in figures being reported.“It doesn’t have a lot of meaning to look at figures for the last three years,” Prof Renwick told AAP FactCheck in an email.“In terms of policy, a huge amount has happened because of the Zero Carbon Act and the emissions budgets being set in the Emissions Trading Scheme. We just haven’t seen that flow through to actual emissions yet.” Experts told AAP FactCheck it’s difficult to assess the Labour led government”s record on emissions","https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11907789,https://nzhistory.govt.nz/new-zealand-becomes-nuclear-free#:~:text=8%20June%201987&text=The%20New%20Zealand%20Nuclear%20Free,and%20biological%20weapon%2Dfree%20zone.&text=In%201989%2C%2052%20per%20cent,armed%20ships%20to%20their%20harbours.,https://youtu.be/50FHR7h3k8A?t=4125,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/emissions-reduction-targets/projected-emissions,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/2050-historical-and-projected-sectoral-emissions-data-2019-BR4.xlsx,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/emissions-reduction-targets/about-measuring-and-reporting-emissions,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/new-zealands-fourth-biennial-report-under-united-nations-framework,https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/snapshot-4th-biennial-report-2019.pdf,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/climate-change-and-government/emissions-reduction-targets/reporting-our-targets-0,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-inventory-1990-2018,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/2020-crf-summary-data.xlsx,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/new-zealands-greenhouse-gas-inventory-1990-2018-snapshot.pdf,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/RIA%20-%20NZ%20ETS%20unit%20supply%20and%20price%20control%20settings.pdf,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/new-zealand-emissions-trading-scheme/about-nz-ets,https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=426100,https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/james.renwick,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/zero-carbon-amendment-act",Evidence on NZ’s carbon emissions far from clear,,,,,,
98,,,,Mostly True,,2020-10-15,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/is-australia-outplaying-nz-on-debt-and-unemployment/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Are debt and unemployment lower in New Zealand than Australia?The Statement“In my view, in New Zealand our unemployment rate is lower, our debt rate is already lower (than Australia’s).”Jacinda Ardern, Labour Party leader and NZ Prime Minister, October 6, 2020.The AnalysisPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been defending the Labour-led government’s COVID-19 response, claiming New Zealand is doing better than Australia on key measures, including unemployment and debt.During an interview on The Mike Hosking Breakfast on NewstalkZB on October 6, the host asked Ms Ardern if Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had “outplayed” her because the Australian government had announced tax cuts as part of its pandemic budget response. (Audio mark 1min 58 secs)“No, no, and we’ve always said – you and I have had this debate often – we’ve always said we’re not at the end of this global pandemic yet,” Ms Ardern replied.“In my view, in New Zealand, our unemployment rate is lower, our debt rate is already lower.”AAP FactCheck examined Ms Ardern’s statement that New Zealand’s unemployment rate and government debt were lower than Australia’s.According to the latest figures from Stats NZ, New Zealand’s unemployment rate for the June quarter was 4.0 per cent, while the most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) are for September, when the unemployment rate was 6.9 per cent.During the June quarter, Australia’s official unemployment rate rose from 6.2 per cent in April to 7.1 per cent in May and 7.4 per cent in June, giving an average rate of 6.9 per cent for the three-month period.Stats NZ noted the June quarter figures may under-represent unemployment as the country was in a lockdown for much of the period.This was because people were only classified as unemployed if they had been actively seeking and available to work in the last four weeks, which may not have been possible during lockdown.“In these cases, the respondent will have been classified as not in the labour force rather than unemployed,” Stats NZ said.Similarly, the Australian unemployment figures come with caveats attached due to COVID-19.The ABS calculated a secondary unemployment measure for the “effective unemployment rate”, which included those who had been stood down from their jobs, or had no or not enough work, but were still considered employed. In July, the unemployment rate including this group was 8.3 per cent, down from a peak of 11.8 per cent in April.In its pre-election update, Treasury predicted New Zealand’s official unemployment rate would peak at 7.8 per cent in the March quarter of 2022, while in Australia the unemployment rate was expected to reach a high of eight per cent in the December quarter of this year, according to budget papers.Government debt can be expressed in both gross and net terms. New Zealand’s gross debt is the government’s total borrowings, while net debt is the same figure less the value of relevant financial assets.However, NZ and Australia calculate net debt in different ways, making it difficult to make direct comparisons between nations.The NZ Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update (PREFU), released on September 16, shows the primary government debt measure, net core Crown debt, was 27.6 per cent of GDP for the year ending June 30, 2020, while gross debt was 33.6 per cent of GDP (Table 2.1, page 40).Net core Crown debt was forecast to increase to 55.3 per cent of GDP in 2024, while gross debt was forecast to rise to 43.9 per cent of GDP. The 2020 figures were unaudited due to a delay caused by COVID-19 and may be revised.The Australian government released its 2020-21 budget on October 6, the same day Ms Ardern was interviewed by Mr Hosking. Budget documents show net debt was lower than New Zealand’s, while its gross debt was slightly higher.Australia’s net debt was 24.8 per cent of GDP for the 2019-2020 financial year, which ended on June 30, while gross debt was 34.5 per cent of GDP (page 6).Australia’s net debt was forecast to rise to 43.8 per cent of GDP in 2024, while gross debt was forecast to reach 51.6 per cent of GDP.A spokesperson from Ms Ardern said the two countries’ net debt figures were not comparable as the New Zealand measure did not include assets in the government’s NZ Super Fund (see page 173), while the Australian figures included its equivalent, the Future Fund.Australia’s Parliamentary Budget office has explored whether Future Fund assets should be included in net debt calculations, suggesting other measures may offer more consistent and complete indicators of the government’s financial position.When the NZ Super Fund is included in calculations, New Zealand’s net debt levels are significantly lower than Australia’s. The PREFU shows NZ’s net debt was 12.1 per cent of GDP in 2019/20 when the fund is included, predicted to rise to to 36.8 per cent in 2024 (page 176).A New Zealand Treasury spokesperson told AAP FactCheck via email that its debt figures were not directly comparable to Australia’s, even with the Super Fund included, due to the use of different accounting frameworks. Treasury recommended using OECD data for comparison purposes.The OECD’s Economic Outlook report, released in June, included forecasts of government debt in member countries based on both the current COVID-19 outbreak being contained and a second outbreak in October/November, called “single-hit” and “double-hit” scenarios.Based on these forecasts, New Zealand would have general government gross debt of 48.7 per cent in 2020 after a single hit and 51.6 per cent of GDP in the case of a double hit (pages 276 and 277).Australia was forecast to have gross debt of 57.1 per cent of GDP after a single hit and 62.4 per cent of GDP from a double hit (pages 137 and 138).However, the OECD forecast Australia would have a lower unemployment rate than New Zealand in 2020 under both scenarios.More recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund, released as part of its fiscal monitor on October 14, predicted Australia would have gross debt worth 60.4 per cent of GDP in 2020 and net debt of 39.4 per cent (full report, pages 75 and 76).Both figures were significantly higher than New Zealand’s forecast gross debt of 48 per cent of GDP and net debt of 21.3 per cent. NZ PM Jacinda Ardern was asked if Scott Morrison had “outplayed” her on COVID-19 budget responses.","https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/ardern-jacinda/,https://www.iheart.com/podcast/211-the-mike-hosking-breakfast-24837692/episode/jacinda-ardern-rejects-accusations-of-politicising-72247137/,https://7news.com.au/business/finance/income-tax-cuts-breeze-through-parliament-c-1375436,https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/unemployment-rate,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/apr-2020,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/may-2020,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/jun-2020,https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/covid-19-and-labour-market-statistics-in-the-june-2020-quarter,https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/understanding-unemployment-and-loss-work-during-covid-19-period-australian-and-international-perspective,https://budget.gov.au/2020-21/content/overview.htm,https://budget.gov.au/2020-21/content/overview.htm#:~:text=Real%20GDP%20is%20forecast%20to,confidence%20to%20employ%20more%20workers.,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLEcoC5141/core-crown-debt,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2020-09/prefu20.pdf,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/media-statement/unaudited-30-june-2020-results-included-pre-election-economic-and-fiscal-update,https://budget.gov.au/2020-21/content/overview.htm,https://budget.gov.au/2020-21/content/download/glossy_overview.pdf,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2020-09/prefu20.pdf,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Budget_Office/Publications/Research_reports/Net_debt_and_investment_funds_-_Trends_and_balance_sheet_implications?CalendarWidgetTarget=03-03-2019&tab=tab2b,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2020-09/prefu20.pdf,https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2020/issue-1_0d1d1e2e-en#page278,https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2020/issue-1_0d1d1e2e-en#page279,https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2020/issue-1_0d1d1e2e-en#page278,https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2020/issue-1_0d1d1e2e-en#page140,https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2020/issue-1_0d1d1e2e-en#page139,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2020/09/30/october-2020-fiscal-monitor",Is Australia ‘outplaying’ NZ on debt and unemployment?,,,,,,

Can they really get on top of the debt when they took, I think it was a $6 billion surplus to a billion dollar deficit in only two years before COVID happened?'”AAP FactCheck analysed Mr Seymour’s claim that a $6 billion surplus had been reduced to a $1 billion deficit in the space of two years pre-COVID-19.The total Crown operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) can be found in the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update reports from Treasury.According to the 2018 report, the government recorded a surplus of $5.5 billion in the financial year ending 30 June, $500 million less than Mr Seymour’s figure of $6 billion (page 22, table 2.1 – fiscal indicators). The following year’s surplus was $7.3 billion, according to the 2019 report (page 24, table 2.1 – fiscal indicators).In the same report, Treasury provides the projected deficit for 2020 as $0.9 billion, close to the $1 billion deficit highlighted by Mr Seymour.The forecast doesn’t take into account the unforeseen impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which pushed the actual 2020 deficit out to $23.4 billion, according to unaudited Treasury figures from September.In explaining the pre-pandemic budget turnaround, Treasury said: “In the past two years the Government has run surpluses of $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion. The Treasury forecasts a small OBEGAL (operating balance before gains and losses) deficit in 2019/20.“This is owing to increased investment at recent Budgets and the temporary effects of the global headwinds … flowing through the New Zealand economy.” ACT leader David Seymour has questioned whether a Labour-led government can rebuild NZ’s economy.","https://www.act.org.nz/david_seymour,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/nz-election-2020-opinion-why-act-is-suddenly-popular-and-where-its-supporters-have-come-from.html,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/ok-you-got-me-seymour-admits-not-following-own-advice-masks-level-1,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-02/fiscalind-fsg.pdf,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-12/hyefu18.pdf,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2019-12/hyefu19.pdf,https://www.treasury.govt.nz/system/files/2020-09/prefu20.pdf,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/bps/bps2020.pdf",Did Labour turn a big surplus into deficit before COVID-19 struck NZ?,,,,,,
102,,,,Partly False,,2020-10-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-false-positives-dont-make-case-figures-meaningless/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post claims the high number of false-positive results from COVID-19 tests is rendering reported case numbers meaningless and the testing of asymptomatic patients useless.The post by an Australian Instagram user features a short video clip of Paul Weston, a British former candidate for UKIP and Pegida UK, in which he says: “And they seem to think that if 10,000 tests returned 110 positives, and the false positive error percentage was one per cent, then the said one per cent applies to the 110 positive results therefore reducing the number to 109, a matter of little importance in the overall scheme of things.”Mr Weston goes on to say, “But they’re wrong. (The false positive rate) applies to the 10,000 tested, and one per cent of 10,000 is 100, meaning the true positive number is only 10, not 109.”The Instagram post’s caption reads, “Herein lies the problem. Case numbers mean nothing. Testing people without symptoms means nothing. Time to quit the biggest hoax in human history. Thanks Paul Weston.”At the time of publication, the September 28 post had been viewed more than 2000 times and received more than 350 likes. The post suggests the number of false positive results are inflating recorded COVID-19 figures. The AnalysisCOVID-19 testing and its accuracy has been the subject of much debate in 2020. There have been testing issues in many countries, including the United States where the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) withdrew batches of testing kits earlier this year due to high rates of false positive tests.False-positive results – a test showing that a person is infected when they are not – could occur in rapid-testing regimes if antibodies on a test strip also recognise antigens of viruses other than COVID-19, the World Health Organization said in April.At the time, it recommended molecular (PCR tests), which require laboratory testing of samples but take longer to return results. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration identifies PCR tests as the “gold standard” for COVID-19 detection, and state governments such as in Victoria deploy the molecular tests as the “test of choice”.False positive rates vary depending on how and where people are tested. False positives are more likely in an area where the prevalence of COVID-19 is low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.A Public Health England research document, published in June, on the UK’s COVID-19 RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing program states that Britain’s false positive rate is unknown.Meanwhile, a BBC report in September detailed the impact of false positives in order to address claims by commentators that they might be skewing COVID-19 figures.Dr Paul Birrell, a statistician at the Medical Research Council’s Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge told the BBC: “The false positive rate is not well understood and could potentially vary according to where and why the test is being taken. A figure of 0.5 per cent for the false positive rate is often assumed.”Despite difficulties with assessing false positive rates, the numbers claimed in the video and their implications for the efficacy of coronavirus results bear no relationship to current COVID-19 testing information, experts told AAP FactCheck.Professor Shaun Hendy from the University of Auckland’s, a physicist who led COVID-19 modelling efforts that informed the New Zealand government’s response to the pandemic, described the claims in the video included in the post as “highly misleading”.“Firstly, the false positive rate is thought to be well below one per cent if the tests are conducted properly (more like 0.1 per cent),” Prof Hendy told AAP FactCheck in an email.“Even then the argument made in the video would only apply if we were doing random testing of the population, which is not what is going on.“In New Zealand, we are testing close contacts of other cases, workers at MIQ (managed isolation and quarantine) facilities, and people with symptoms.“These groups are much more likely to have the disease than a random sample of the population, so the number of true positives will likely exceed false positives.”University of Otago’s Professor David Murdoch, who specialises in epidemiology and infections, agreed, telling AAP FactCheck via email: “I’m not actually sure what a ‘false positive error percentage’ is, but we certainly wouldn’t use a test for which only 10 out of 110 positive results are truly positive.”The video snippet included in the post is taken from a longer video featured on Mr Weston’s YouTube channel. In the video, he claims the true false positive rate for COVID-19 tests in the UK is 2.3 per cent – an apparent reference to a figure included in the Public Health England document (page 2).The figure was drawn from a paper from three US academics, whose specialisations are in marine biology, plant biology and obstetrics/gynecology (page 10), who cited the false positives rates from PCR tests for other viruses, such as SARS, MERS and Zika (page 4).Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong, said the testing regime for COVID-19 is not turning up the claimed number of false positive results – making it numerically impossible for a high percentage of tests to be returning incorrect readings.For example, NSW conducted 68,421 reported tests in the seven days ending at 8pm on October 4, resulting in one positive case. At a false positive rate of one per cent, assuming no follow-up testing, there would have been 684 positive tests.“As I explain in my blog, not only is the prevalence of COVID-19 (the proportion of people who actually have the disease) quite high in those tested (because they are a selected, symptomatic population), the specificity of PCR tests for COVID-19 is quite a bit higher than 99 per cent,” he told AAP FactCheck.Test specificity is the measure of a medical test’s ability to correctly generate a negative result for people without COVID-19 – in other words, its ability to generate an accurate negative result.“While no test is ever truly perfect, it is impossible for the specificity of the testing scheme in the UK to be lower than 99.92 per cent, and a reasonable estimate is somewhere around 99.995 per cent overall,” Mr Meyerowitz-Katz said.Regarding the post’s claims false positives are inflating COVID-19 figures, Mr Meyerowitz-Katz said false negatives are more likely than false positives in the populations currently being tested.“Ninety-nine per cent-plus of the positives in this population, given the true values, would be true positives, and in fact the main issue would be missing people who actually have the disease,” he said. Laboratory workers work on PCR testing samples amid the COVID-19 outbreak.","https://archive.vn/r4uxp,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClCJ4KEsWkhzvvxftRf0FYw/about,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/former-ukip-candidate-and-pegida-uk-leader-paul-weston-says-muslims-should-not-hold-political-power-and-claims-syrian-refugees-do-not-exist-a6856086.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/contamination-at-cdc-lab-delayed-rollout-of-coronavirus-tests/2020/04/18/fd7d3824-7139-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/advice-on-the-use-of-point-of-care-immunodiagnostic-tests-for-covid-19,https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-testing-australia-information-health-professionals,https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/assessment-and-testing-criteria-coronavirus-covid-19#serology-based-tests,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/2/03-0759_article,https://www.bbc.com/news/54270373,https://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/pjb51@cam.ac.uk,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/shaun-hendy,https://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/data-lab-home-access-during-covid-19-lockdown,https://www.otago.ac.nz/christchurch/departments/pathology/people/otago014202.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06yja21V7xg,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080911v4.full.pdf+html,https://www.uow.edu.au/the-arts-social-sciences-humanities/research/powerlab/people/,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/gideon-meyerowitz-katz,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/stats-nsw.aspx,https://medium.com/@gidmk/most-positive-coronavirus-tests-are-true-positives-60c95fe54fec,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/toolkit/tips-for-understanding-studies/understanding-medical-tests-sensitivity-specificity-and-positive-predictive-value/",COVID-19 ‘false positives’ don’t make case figures meaningless,,,,,,

It is anticipated that bookings will change closer to the commencement of the 2020-2021 season”.At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 110 times, attracting more than 400 reactions and 350 comments. The Facebook post shows cruise ship arrivals in Tasmania from December. The AnalysisWhile the cruise ship arrivals included in the Facebook post were previously scheduled for Tasmanian ports, updated schedules show none of the passenger vessels are due to arrive until October 2021.International cruise ships have been banned from arriving in Australia, except in cases of emergency, since the federal government declared a biosecurity emergency on March 18 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In September, the ban and related measures under the Biosecurity Act were extended until December 17. Smaller vessels – those capable of carrying fewer than 100 passengers – and domestic cruises are still permitted to dock during the ban.The cruise ship schedule in the post shows two expected arrivals in Hobart this year: the Coral Adventurer on December 8 and the Coral Discoverer on December 31.Both are small vessels, carrying 120 passengers and 72 passengers respectively, that operate mainly in Australian waters, according to the Coral Expeditions website.The schedule also includes larger cruise ships, such as the 2,670-guest Sapphire Princess. None of these are listed to arrive until October 2021.However, a current TasPorts shipping schedule, retrieved by AAP FactCheck on October 9, shows no cruise ships of any sizes scheduled to arrive in Tasmania until October 2021 at Hobart and November 2021 at Burnie.An archived version of TasPorts’ Hobart shipping schedule from August 5, 2020, shows a schedule generally consistent with the dates in the Facebook post. It is unclear when the schedule was updated.A spokeswoman for TasPorts, the state body responsible for the management and maintenance of 11 Tasmanian ports, told AAP FactCheck in an email that forward shipping schedules were “subject to continual change” during the pandemic.“There remains a high level of uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the 2020-2021 domestic cruise ship season,” she said.“Cruise lines are providing rolling updates on cancellations of calls in line with ongoing developments associated with COVID-19. Cruise ship visits to Tasmania will not resume until government directions permit.”Border restrictions remain in place in Tasmania, with anyone except for “essential travellers” such as healthcare workers arriving from interstate required to quarantine for 14 days. The state plans to ease the rules on October 26. International cruise ships have been banned from Australian ports since March.","https://archive.is/Mg7JL,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2020/March/COVID-19_Biosecurity_Emergency_Declaration,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/human-biosecurity-emergency-period-extended-by-three-months,https://www.coralexpeditions.com/au/our-fleet/coral-adventurer/,https://www.coralexpeditions.com/au/our-fleet/coral-discoverer/,https://www.princess.com/ships-and-experience/ships/sa-sapphire-princess/,https://archive.vn/ihkIz,https://archive.vn/mIWmB,https://web.archive.org/web/20200805133232/http://nexus.tasports.com.au/shippingschedules/shipping04.html ,https://www.tasports.com.au/corporate/about-tasports/,https://coronavirus.tas.gov.au/travellers-and-visitors/essential-travellers,https://coronavirus.tas.gov.au/travellers-and-visitors/quarantine,https://coronavirus.tas.gov.au/travellers-and-visitors/coming-to-tasmania",Is Tasmania about to welcome back cruise ships?,,,,,,

Two years of Corrections Vote is more than all the money paid out in all Treaty settlements.”Mr Tamihere added: “We cannot lock our way up out of this. We have to make our people positive, progressive citizens and we have to stop being embedded in welfarism.”AAP FactCheck analysed Mr Tamihere’s statement that two years’ Vote Corrections budget is greater than the total amount paid out in all Treaty of Waitangi settlements.NZ government budgets are divided into areas called ‘votes’. Vote Corrections is the budget allocated to the NZ Department of Corrections.Treaty of Waitangi settlements are the result of claims made by Maori against the Crown for breaching the articles of the 1840 Treaty before 1992.Treaty settlements are now the responsibility of the Crown entity, the Office for Maori Crown Relations – Te Arawhiti.In a written statement to AAP FactCheck, a spokesperson for Te Arawhiti said there had been 90 deeds of settlement negotiated and signed over the past 31 years, totalling $2.272 billion.The Vote Corrections budget documents show the total annual appropriation of Vote Corrections for 2020/21 was $2.429 billion (page 22). The estimated actual appropriation for 2019/20 was $2.211 billion. The Maori Party has drawn comparisons between Corrections funding and Treaty of Waitangi pay-outs.","https://www.maoriparty.org/,https://youtu.be/77R4X2cE9ec?t=1168,https://www.maoriparty.org/whanau_first,https://www.corrections.govt.nz/resources/research_and_statistics/quarterly_prison_statistics/prison_stats_june_2020#ethnicity,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/employment-and-skills/labour-market-reports-data-and-analysis/other-labour-market-reports/maori-labour-market-trends/#:~:text=The%20M%C4%81ori%20unemployment%20rate%20(10.8,%25)%20and%20women%20(12.0%25).,https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/by/vote/index.htm,https://www.corrections.govt.nz/,https://www.govt.nz/browse/history-culture-and-heritage/treaty-of-waitangi-claims/settling-historical-treaty-of-waitangi-claims/,https://www.tearawhiti.govt.nz/about-us/,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v7/est20-v7-corr.pdf",Has NZ spent more on Corrections in two years than on all Treaty of Waitangi settlements?,,,,,,

If it’s a man, they’re usually beaten and robbed and maybe left for dead, too”.The post also urges drivers who have eggs thrown at their windscreens during these attacks to not stop their cars or operate the windscreen wipers.“Eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5%, and you are then forced to stop beside the road and become a victim of these criminals,” the post claims.The September 24 post had been shared more than 15,000 times, attracting more than 1500 comments and 1400 reactions at the time of writing. A purported police warning about gangs using fake babies to lure unsuspecting drivers. The AnalysisWhile the Facebook user claims in the post that the described events happened to them, the language and the punctuation mirrors that used in other posts dating back to as early as 2009.One Facebook version, from 2013, includes references to Eastern Europe and 999 – the emergency number used in the United Kingdom and several other former colonies – which have been altered in the version shared among Australian users, which lists the emergency number as 000.Otherwise, the posts are virtually identical, including the use of capitals for “police” and the placement of punctuation such as ellipses.In late 2009, US fact-checking organisation Snopes debunked a similar hoax. It said the rumour of gangs using bloodied car seats to lure female motorists from the vehicles had been attributed to two US police departments, which said the information was either false or could not be verified.The text of the earlier purported gang warning, as reported by Snopes, again includes near-identical wording and punctuation to the version being shared in Australia.Meanwhile, fact-checking website Hoax Slayer debunked another near-identical version of the claim when it surfaced in the UK in 2019. Sussex Police confirmed it had not issued the warning at the time.The latest version of the post did not specify where the alleged event took place, however the user’s Facebook profile stated that they were based in northern NSW. The same post was shared later on September 24 by a user whose profile stated they lived in Brisbane.When contacted by AAP FactCheck, NSW Police declined to comment on the post. However a search of keywords included in the post showed no record of any related warning being issued by the police service, nor were there any similar alerts posted on the Facebook pages for NSW Police or the local police command.The claim about criminals throwing eggs at drivers’ windscreens to block visibility and force cars to stop to carry out robberies has also been repeatedly debunked (see here, here and here).A video testing the theory that eggs smashed on a windscreen would block visibility also found there were “no problems whatsoever” for wipers to clear the debris. The claims in the Facebook post do not tally with any official warnings from police.","https://archive.is/OHeEW ,https://archive.vn/4YRF7,https://www.neas.nhs.uk/news/2019/september/9/national-emergency-services-day-the-history-of-999.aspx,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-national-gang-week/,https://www.hoax-slayer.net/gang-initiation-warning-hoax-infant-car-seat-left-on-roadside/?fbclid=IwAR3fdFolGXnHLEsAR1y21yGz7Xje1dgSKV99NcVn3SvOBDoTBb2MquJVUQE,https://archive.vn/5mOj9,https://www.google.com/search?q=gang+initiation+fake+baby+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.police.nsw.gov.au&rlz=1C1GCEV_enAU918AU918&oq=gang+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j46j69i57j46l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.1239j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.facebook.com/page/218519706184/search/?q=gang%20initiation%20fake%20baby,https://www.facebook.com/page/284109264975867/search/?q=gang%20initiation%20fake%20baby,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/robbers-throwing-eggs-car-windshields/ ,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/25/facebook-posts/no-police-are-not-warning-public-about-gangs-throw/,https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/windscreen-egged-ignore-facebook-advice-and-use-your-wipers/ ,https://youtu.be/l4C2EbYJeQ4",Are gangs using fake babies to lure Australian motorists?,,,,,,
107,,,,False,,2020-10-06,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/post-misleads-on-australian-covid-19-death-data/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims a Department of Health report reveals that COVID-19 death figures for Australia have been dramatically overstated and the real tally is less than one-tenth of the official count.The post, headlined “There is ‘NO’ Covid Pandemic,” claims that the COVID-19 Epidemiology Report “proves with its own evidence the 29 August 2020 deaths were ‘not’ 600! The true Covid deaths are only 54!”.It goes on to claim, “The deaths recorded show 91% of deaths had massive ‘Comorbidity’ diseases of chronic cardiac disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease or dying of old age. 54 deaths in a 25 million population is ‘not’ a pandemic!”.At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 325 times and received more than 35,000 views. A post claims a Department of Health report reveals COVID-19 death figures have been overstated. The AnalysisThe Facebook post is one of a series of claims circulating on social media – see examples here, here and here – claiming that COVID-19 deaths are far fewer than the numbers being reported by governments.These posts often misrepresent what comorbidities are and how they are catalogued in relation to COVID-19-linked deaths. The latest post reinterprets sections of an Australian Department of Health report on Communicable Diseases Intelligence to make incorrect claims that there is no pandemic and that only nine per cent of Australian COVID-19 deaths were caused by the virus.A comorbidity means the existence of two or more diseases in a person at one time, according to a 2016 paper by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. These diseases may be unrelated but many share common risk factors.The Facebook post claims that the fatal COVID-19 cases were also suffering “massive comorbidity diseases”. A comorbidity is not by definition a fatal illness – it can include such conditions as obesity, diabetes, arthritis, asthma and back pain, according to the Department of Health report (table 7, page 16).A spokesperson for the Department of Health told AAP FactCheck via email that the fatalities listed in the August 2 report are directly linked to COVID-19.“State and territory health departments only report to the NNDSS (National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) COVID-19 deaths where it is considered that COVID-19 was the primary or a contributing cause of their death,” the spokesperson said.The post also incorrectly quotes “91% of deaths” as having comorbidities, when this figure in the report relates to all hospitalised patients whose data was captured by facilities using the sentinel events tracking system (see report page 14).Dr Craig Dalton, an epidemiologist at the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Newcastle, said the post contained false information.He said the Department of Health report “lists the comorbidities that fatal cases had at the time of death”.“These included a wide range of illnesses including diabetes and obesity – two diseases that many people are diagnosed with in their 20s or 30s but go on to live with for many years. Many of the other diseases listed could allow people to live for decades,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.“It can be assumed that all of the people who require (intensive) care for significant lung damage from COVID-19 who have a fatal outcome would not have died at that time if they had not had COVID-19.”Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong, described the post as misleading.“(It) is basically disinformation. Broadly we would expect most people who die of anything to have more than one contributing factor,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email.Mr Meyerowitz-Katz has written about similar claims on US COVID-19 death data and concluded they were wrong and misleading.The Australian Bureau of Statistics has also published guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 and notes that the coronavirus should be included whenever it was a contributing factor.“The new coronavirus strain (COVID-19) should be recorded on the medical cause of death certificate for ALL decedents where the disease caused, or is assumed to have caused, or contributed to death,” the guidelines state.In a previous AAP FactCheck relating to CDC COVID-19 death figures and comorbidities, the US National Center of Health Statistics noted that many comorbidities develop as a result of COVID-19.“These causes may include chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension,” the US National Center of Health Statistics told AAP FactCheck at the time. “They may also include acute conditions that occurred as a result of COVID-19, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.” A Facebook post claims ‘real’ COVID-19 deaths are far fewer than those reported by governments.","https://archive.is/q3ZDs,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/cdc-did-not-admit-only-6-of-recorded-deaths-from-covid-19/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/04/viral-image/people-are-dying-covid-19/,https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/no-the-cdc-did-not-quietly-adjust-u-s-coronavirus-deaths-from-153504-to-9210/,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/1D03BCB527F40C8BCA258503000302EB/$File/covid_19_australia_epidemiology_report_22_fortnightly_reporting_period_ending_2_august_2020.pdf,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/666de2ad-1c92-4db3-9c01-1368ba3c8c98/ah16-3-3-chronic-disease-comorbidities.pdf.aspx,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/1D03BCB527F40C8BCA258503000302EB/$File/covid_19_australia_epidemiology_report_22_fortnightly_reporting_period_ending_2_august_2020.pdf,https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/indicators/australian-sentinel-events-list,https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/craig-dalton,https://www.uow.edu.au/the-arts-social-sciences-humanities/research/powerlab/people/,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/gideon-meyerowitz-katz,https://medium.com/@gidmk/covid-19-deaths-are-mostly-caused-by-coronavirus-2a6d2d43bd09,https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1205.0.55.001Main%20Features12008?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1205.0.55.001&issue=2008&num=&view=,https://www.aap.com.au/claims-on-cdc-data-for-covid-19-incorrect-say-experts/",Post misleads on Australian COVID-19 death data,,,,,,

The caption on Facebook reads: “Yikes.” At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 740 times, attracting over 2300 reactions and 870 comments. A meme with a purported Judith Collins quote praising Donald Trump is circulating on social media. The AnalysisDuring the Newshub Leaders Debate on October 30, New Zealand’s two major party leaders touched on numerous topics, including US President Donald Trump.Moderator Patrick Gower asked both leaders if they thought Mr Trump was “dangerous influence on the world”. (1hr 22min 35sec mark)During the subsequent discussion, National leader Judith Collins referred to a recent agreement Mr Trump brokered to normalise relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, an agreement signed September 15.It makes UAE only the third Arab state to formally recognise and open diplomatic relations with Israel, and the first since Jordan in 1994.“(Mr Trump) has actually done some quite recent stuff with Israel and UAE and so actually that’s better than war, don’t you think?,” Collins said in response to Gower’s question. “He hasn’t been ready to rush into war.”“It is a worry when the best thing you can say is at least we haven’t had war,” Labour leader Jacinda Ardern responded.Ms Collins continued: “Well actually it’s a damn sight better than any of the other presidents that have been there before, including those that you admire, Ms Ardern. Actually I think keeping away from war is a good thing.”Former US secretary of defense Robert Gates, who served under both presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, recently delivered similar praise on Meet the Press, saying: “Unlike (Mr Trump’s) three predecessors … at least he hasn’t started any new wars.” (6min 11sec mark)Earlier Ms Collins said she thought Mr Trump “could have done better” with the COVID-19 response in the United States, and both leaders said they would work with whichever candidate won the election.While the quote included in the Facebook meme is largely accurate, the word “it’s” in Ms Collins’ debate response – a reference to Mr Trump’s record in initiating wars – has been replaced with “he’s”, wrongly implying that the National leader said the current US president was better than all those before him. National leader Judith Collins praised US President Donald Trump for not starting any wars.","https://archive.vn/RDFsl,https://twitter.com/komerata/status/1311410358309974016,https://youtu.be/50FHR7h3k8A?t=4956,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-promoting-peace-stability-middle-east/,https://theconversation.com/whats-next-for-arab-israeli-relations-after-the-uae-deal-144651,https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Biographies/Biography/Article/602797,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgpV9xsSGrg",Manipulated Collins quote misrepresents praise for Trump,,,,,,

The policy became law in February 2019.During the Newshub Leaders’ Debate on September 30, Ms Collins said the policy had resulted in an increase in carbon emissions. (Video mark 1hr, 8min, 30secs).“The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually our coal use has now gone up so now we’ve got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity,” Ms Collins said.AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins statement that coal use had gone up and more coal is being used to generate electricity instead of gas, as a result of the government’s offshore oil and gas exploration ban.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes figures on coal consumption, which do not show an increase in coal consumption after the ban became law.Quarterly MBIE figures show coal consumption declined by 27 per cent between the December 2018 quarter – before the oil and gas exploration ban came into effect – and the June 2020 quarter (table 1).As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures.Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes.MBIE also reports quarterly on the make-up of New Zealand’s electricity generation (table 1).Figures for the year to June show coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6 per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1261GWh to 1912GWh.The figures also show gas-powered electricity generation declined by 10.3 per cent, from 6,354GWh in 2018 to 5,701GWh in 2020.However, MBIE’s annual report on the energy sector said the increase in coal-powered generation was due to lower hydro electricity generation as the result of a dry year and maintenance at NZ’s largest gas field, which reduced the supply of gas (page 14).“Electricity generation from coal increased by 43 per cent in 2019,” the report said. “This was due to the need for non-renewable generation as a result of less favourable hydrological conditions, and gas outages meaning that there was less gas available for electricity generation use.” (page 14)The report does not mention that the oil and gas exploration ban has had an impact on the supply of gas. It shows gas production is expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining (page 43, Fig E.7).The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government’s oil and gas exploration ban and noted that the recent increase in coal-powered generation was “not because of the ban” (page 40).It found that, in future, a reduction in gas supply for electricity generation could result in more coal being used as it is currently the cheapest substitute (page 40). But it said “coal is unlikely to play a role in New Zealand’s electricity sector for much longer” due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and coal being phased out by major generators (page 41).It found New Zealand’s remaining gas reserves would probably be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation when hydro dams are low “for several decades to come, albeit at a higher cost than at present” (page 39).National Party energy and resources spokesperson Jonathan Young made similar claims about the government’s oil and gas exploration ban in September which he later admitted was “completely wrong”. National says an oil and gas exploration ban means coal is being used more to generate electricity.","https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/collins-judith/,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/planning-future-no-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-permits,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2018/0047/latest/LMS30905.html,https://youtu.be/50FHR7h3k8A?t=4109,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/,http://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/energy-statistics-and-modelling/energy-statistics/coal-statistics/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Electricity.xlsx,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11679-energy-in-new-zealand-2020,https://www.pce.parliament.nz/media/197019/report-restricting-the-production-of-fossil-fuels-in-aotearoa-new-zealand.pdf,https://www.aap.com.au/new-zealands-oil-and-gas-ban-hasnt-led-to-energy-price-spike/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/122924962/national-mp-admits-his-claim-about-offshore-oil-and-gas-ban-increasing-power-prices-was-wrong",NZ National overstates impact of oil and gas exploration ban,,,,,,

The latest figures were released in December 2019, and cover the year to March 2019.This shows that international tourism expenditure was $17.2b and contributed 20.4 per cent to New Zealand’s total exports of goods and services.The figures also include expenditure from international students who studied in the country for less than 12 months. These students spent $3.9 billion, comprised of course fees, living costs, and airfares on resident airlines.Based on these figures, international tourism and students contributed $21.1b to the economy in 2019.However, these figures may underestimate the total contribution of international students to the economy. A 2018 government report found the sector contributed $5.1b to the economy, supporting 49,631 jobs.Whereas Ms Collins indicated the entire $21b export value of the sector had been lost, Stats NZ figures for the June quarter show both sectors are still contributing to the economy, despite the border closures.But the statistics show spending by international visitors and students was down 50.3 per cent to $1.76b compared to the same period last year.Stats NZ international statistics senior manager Peter Dolan said spending by visitors did not stop when the borders closed because there were still tens of thousands of visitors already in the country.In mid-March it was estimated there were between 240,000 and 260,000 visitors in New Zealand, and by August there were still between 90,000 and 120,000 visitors. Tourism and international students are still contributing to the NZ economy, despite border closures","https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/stronger-border-measures-protect-nzers-covid-19,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/covid-19-stabilising-international-education-sector-rebuilds,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/immigration-and-tourism/tourism/tourism-recovery/,https://youtu.be/50FHR7h3k8A?t=1078,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/tourism-satellite-account-2019,https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/international-education-contributes-5-1-billion-to-new-zealand,https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/covid-19-knocks-spending-by-overseas-visitors-and-students",Are tourists and international students still contributing to the NZ economy?,,,,,,

As of September 29, there have been 33,249,563 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,000,040 deaths, according to the WHO.However official figures relating to the pandemic have been the subject of numerous false and misleading claims as some question the seriousness of the virus.In the graphic included in the Facebook post, the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio was presented as: 0-19 years, .00003%; 20-49 years, .0002%; 50-69 years, .005%; 70+ years, .054%.The figures are an erroneous interpretation of figures presented by CDC. Included in the article COVID19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios, updated on the CDC’s website on September 10, there is a table showing the “current best estimate” of infection fatality ratios. These are 0-19 years, 0.00003; 20-49 years, 0.0002; 50-69 years, 0.005; 70+ years, 0.054.However, the figures are ratios, meaning they have to be multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Thus the correct percentages of deaths among those infected with COVID-19 in each age cohort, according to the CDC figures, are: 0-19 years, .003%; 20-49 years, .02%; 50-69 years, .5%; 70+ years, 5.4%. These rates are 100 times higher than those included in the post graphic.The graphic in the post was shown during the Fox News show The Ingraham Angle on September 23 in which host Laura Ingraham discussed the CDC data. A transcript from the show provided to AAP FactCheck by Fox News includes Ingraham citing the survival rate for the 0-19 years age group as 99.997 per cent, and 94 per cent for people age 70 and over.Fox News confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email that figures in the graphic were incorrect.A spokesperson pointed to Ingraham’s correct quoting of the data while adding “the percentage symbols in the graphic were shown in error”.Michael Plank, a professor of Applied Mathematics at New Zealand’s University of Canterbury and a COVID-19 modeller, also confirmed to AAP FactCheck via email that the figures in the graphic were out by a factor of 100.Another study, from France, broadly supports the CDC data. It found the overall fatality rate to be 0.5 per cent for those infected with COVID-19. When broken down by age group, the fatality rate ranged from 0.001 per cent in those aged under 20 to 8.3 per cent in the 80-and-over cohort. Numerous false and misleading claims have been made about COVID-19 death rates.","https://archive.vn/36yvA,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://covid19.who.int/,https://www.aap.com.au/claims-on-cdc-data-for-covid-19-incorrect-say-experts/,https://www.aap.com.au/lockdown-critic-says-covid-19-is-only-slightly-worse-than-the-flu/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/ingraham-angle,https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/michael-plank.html,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6500/208",Death rate figures for COVID-19 don’t add up,,,,,,

The figures, which are not routinely published nor publicly available, show police officer numbers as distinct from the total number of NZ Police employees.According to NZ Police, in June 2008, there were 8,211 police officers. Ms Collins first became police minister in November 2008.The NZ Police figures show officer numbers then rose to 8,643 in June 2009 and 8,707 in June 2010, before dropping to 8,638 in June 2011.Ms Collins’ portfolios changed in December 2011, but she returned to the role of police minister in December 2015.There were 8,923 police officers in June 2015 and this dropped to 8,899 in June 2016. Ms Collins portfolios changed again in December 2016.While there were some year-on-year decreases in the number of police officers during Ms Collins’ stints as police minister, officer numbers increased overall by 688.However, when measured as a ratio of the population of New Zealand, police numbers decreased.According to a table of Census data showing the past 29 years, there were an estimated 4,259,800 people resident in NZ in June 2008. The population rose to 4,302,600 in June 2009; 4,350,700 in June 2010; 4,384,000 in June 2011; 4,585,600 in June 2015; and 4,678,100 in June 2016.AAP FactCheck calculated police numbers as a ratio of the resident population for the years in which Ms Collins was police minister by dividing the population figures by the constabulary numbers for the corresponding year.This revealed there was one police officer for every 519 NZ residents in June 2008, one for every 498 residents in June 2009, 1/500 in 2010, 1/507 in 2011, 1/514 in 2015 and 1/526 in 2016. NZ PM Jacinda Ardern says National leader Judith Collins was behind a decline in police numbers.","https://www.beehive.govt.nz/minister/biography/jacinda-ardern,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/collins-judith/,https://youtu.be/50FHR7h3k8A?t=2684,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/collins-judith/,https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/population",NZ PM makes flawed claim about police numbers under National,,,,,,

In the last three years this government has increased it by another 0.5 per cent.”Simeon Brown, National Party MP,  September 28, 2020.The AnalysisThe National Party is claiming the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources increased more when it was in power than under the Labour-led government, while also taking credit for that rise.The Labour Party agreed on a plan to transition to 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2035 in the party’s confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party from October 2017 (page 3).In September 2020, Labour said it would bring forward the target to 2030 if it was re-elected.But during TVNZ’s Young Voters’ Debate on Monday September 28, National Party MP Simeon Brown said the proportion of renewable generation had increased more during the previous National government than under Labour. (Video mark 51min 44secs).“They talk about wanting to have 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030,” Mr Brown said.“At the last election they said it was 100 per cent renewable by 2035. Well the actual fact is when we were in government we increased renewable energy from 65.4 per cent to 81.9 per cent.“In the last three years this government has increased it by another 0.5 per cent.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Brown’s statement that the proportion of renewable energy generation increased from 65.4 per cent to 81.9 per cent under the National government, and a further 0.5 per cent under the Labour-led government. The claim that National was responsible for the rise during its term of government is also examined.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) reports on the make-up of NZ’s electricity sector each quarter.Mr Brown appears to be using calendar-year figures from the report (table 2).The previous National government was elected on November 8, 2008, and figures for that year show 65.4 per cent of the country’s electricity came from renewable sources at the time.The party left government on September 23, 2017. That year, 81.9 per cent of the country’s electricity came from renewables – matching the figures Mr Brown quoted.The Labour-led government formed on October 19, 2017. The MBIE data shows in 2019 the share of electricity that came from renewable sources was 82.4 per cent, an increase of 0.5 percentage points since 2017.Quarterly figures are also available and more closely align with the terms of the two governments (table 1).Figures for the year to September 2008 show 64.0 per cent of the country’s electricity came from renewable sources prior to National taking power, but that proportion increased to 83.5 per cent for the year to September 2017.The most recent figures, for the year to June 2020, show renewable sources made up 82.2 per cent of all electricity generation, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points on the year before Labour formed government.The figures show that most of the gains in renewable energy during National’s three terms in government came from a greater reliance on hydro and geothermal-generated power.Between 2008 and 2017, coal-powered generation dropped 74.9 per cent, while gas-powered generation was down around one-third.Since the Labour coalition came to power, coal-fired generation more than doubled, based on figures for the year to June, although coal only made up around 4.4 per cent of net generation in the latest 12-month period. Gas generation has fallen slightly during the term of the Labour government.In his statement, Mr Brown took credit for the increase in renewable generation under National, saying “we increased renewable energy” before quoting the relevant figures, and pointing to a lower increase from the current governmentHowever, MBIE’s annual report on the energy sector said renewable generation decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower rainfall during the drought resulting in less hydro electricity generation (page 12).It said coal-powered generation was increased to make up for the shortfall and because of a shortage in gas due to maintenance at the Pohokura gas field (page 14).It should also be noted that the proportion of renewable electricity has fluctuated significantly since records began in 1974. For example, in 1980 91.3 per cent of electricity generation was from renewable sources, while 2001 had the lowest proportion of renewable generation, at 64.7 per cent.Experts warned against crediting National with changes in the renewable energy makeup during its last period of government.University of Auckland senior economics lecturer Stephen Poletti has written multiple papers on New Zealand’s electricity market. He told AAP FactCheck geothermal electricity generation increased under the National government and gas power plants were retired for financial reasons.“This was nothing to do with any policies to have more renewable electricity,” Dr Poletti said.“There was not a single policy measure in place to increase renewable generation under the last government apart from the ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) which had a carbon price of zero over most of the time National was last in power.”Chair of the Sustainable Energy Systems department at Victoria University of Wellington Professor Alan Brent said governments historically haven’t determined the make-up of electricity generation and construction of renewable generation has been driven by market forces rather than government policy. The share of electricity coming from renewable sources has fallen under the Labour government.","https://www.parliament.nz/media/4487/nzlp___gp_c_s_agreement.pdf,https://www.labour.org.nz/release-renewable-electricity-generation-2030,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/full-video-young-voters-debate,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Electricity.xlsx,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLLawrp08051/final-results-for-the-2008-new-zealand-general-election,https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2017/new-zealand-2017-general-election-official-results/,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/341958/honour-and-a-privilege-jacinda-ardern,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Electricity.xlsx,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11679-energy-in-new-zealand-2020,https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/people/spol002,https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/ecs/research/chairs/sustainable-energy-systems/people",National misleads with NZ renewable energy claims,,,,,,
115,,,,False –,,2020-09-30,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/false-ardern-dairy-quote-milked-for-all-its-worth/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook meme features a purported quote by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern which reads, “Dairy farming is a world of the past.”The meme, posted to a pro-National Facebook page, features a photo of Ms Ardern alongside the comment: “#BREAKING Labour will never support our farmers.”The September 22 post had attracted more than 1400 comments, 1900 reactions and 920 shares at the time of writing. A Facebook meme features a purported quote by NZ PM Jacinda Ardern on dairy farming. The AnalysisThe meme misquotes the New Zealand prime minister and makes a point about dairy farming that Jacinda Ardern never addressed during the televised leaders’ debate between her and National leader Judith Collins on September 22.Despite the quote’s inaccuracies being reported by the media following the leadership debate, several National MPs also shared it on their Facebook pages.AAP FactCheck found that minutes before the meme was posted on the National Party’s Meme Working Group Facebook page, the National Party’s official Twitter account tweeted: “Did…. did @jacindaardern just say that the world of farming is in the past? Outrageous. Our Farmers are 64% more emissions efficient than the global average. Our farmers are already the most emissions efficient producers of milk in the world. #LeadersDebate #YourFuture.”AAP FactCheck examined the section of the debate from which the purported quote was taken. In this video of the debate (mark 1hr 22min 24sec), Ms Ardern says: “If I may, that feels to me like the view of a world that has passed.” Dairy farming is not mentioned in the prime minister’s statement.To understand the quote’s context, Ms Ardern’s initial statement (mark 1hr 21min 15sec) was: “But on the issue of change that we are all facing in New Zealand, I absolutely accept that when we are looking at what our export markets are seeking now, they want to know that you are, that we are, producing our food sustainably, that we’re mindful of climate change, biodiversity, and water quality. And that creates pressure on all of us.“My view is that we’ve got to do this together. The work we’ve done this year has been by building consensus – a historic agreement called He Waka Eke Noa is all about how we as New Zealand, alongside our farmers, will face our climate challenges. And I am so proud of that, because we did that alongside our farmers and primary producers.”He Waka Eke Noa is the name of the partnership agreement between the NZ government, the primary sector and Maori industry leaders to reduce emissions in the farming sector.The backdrop of Ms Ardern’s comment was a point about consensus between the primary sector and government, and how the government had worked alongside farmers and primary producers on issues such as climate change and biodiversity.Ms Collins understood the point but disagreed with its premise (mark 1hr 21min 55sec): “Actually farmers aren’t feeling like that, John (Campbell, debate moderator). Farmers are feeling like they’re bagged all the time by this government. Remember ‘dirty dairying’? That was the Greens and Labour going into that.“You know, John, when I grew up being a dairy farmer’s kid I was so proud, I was proud as punch. And now I’ve got dairy farmers saying to me, young dairy farmers, saying ‘I’m only a dairy farmer’. Because they feel that they have got the weight of the world on them.”It was at that point Ms Ardern responded with her comment, “If I may, that feels to me like the view of a world that has passed.” She continued by saying she met with primary producers and they “absolutely see the need for us to be competitive in this environment” before referencing climate change and sustainability.AAP FactCheck contacted National MPs Harete Hipango and Matt King for comment regarding their sharing of the meme but received no reply. However, Ms Collins reportedly refused to criticise the pair for the posts, saying the MPs were “genuinely reflecting what they believe”.The reposting of the meme on Ms Hipango’s Facebook page had been shared 89 times, attracting more than 400 comments and 200 reactions at the time of writing. The post on Mr King’s Facebook page, which included the caption “unbelieveable from the Labour leader tonight”, had been shared 49 times, attracting 294 comments and 300 reactions.The Facebook post misquotes Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on dairy farming in New Zealand.","http://archive.vn/Ec6hN,https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2020/08/election-2020-the-whole-truth/#/1193324691/national-mps-are-twisting-jacinda-ardern-s-words-on-social-media,https://twitter.com/NZNationalParty/status/1308316528681467910,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSC_UB3XvyY,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/he-waka-eke-noa-primary-sector-climate-change-action-partnership,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/hipango-harete/,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/king-matt/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300116953/election-2020-judith-collins-refuses-to-condemn-false-quote-posted-by-her-mps,http://archive.today/KDjCG,http://archive.vn/hzg6T",False Ardern dairy quote milked for all its worth,,,,,,

He also has financially contributed to vaccine research through the foundation bearing his and his wife’s names.However he has also been the target of numerous hoaxes and conspiracy theories.AAP FactCheck found earlier examples of the latest quote attributed to Mr Gates, for example here and here.

(Audio mark 13min 22sec).“We have focused on the middle income New Zealanders, people earning $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year, and putting $3000 in their hand over the 16 months from the first of December,” Mr Goldsmith said.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Goldsmith’s statement that people earning between $50,000 and $70,000 would be $3000 better off under National’s proposed tax cuts.New Zealand has four marginal income tax rates which apply based on three income thresholds.The National Party’s tax proposal involves lifting the lowest tax bracket threshold from $14,000 to $20,000, the middle threshold from $48,000 to $64,000 and the top threshold from $70,000 to $90,000.This effectively means that those who earn more than $14,000 a year will pay less tax, and those who earn more than $90,000 will get the full benefit of the change in each threshold.But exactly how much a person benefits under the policy depends heavily on their income.The National Party’s website has a tool which allows users to enter their income to calculate how much they would benefit from the tax changes.This calculator shows someone on an income of $50,000 would have a total tax savings of $893 over 16 months, those on $60,000 would save $2,560 and someone on $70,000 would save $3227.To get a $3000 benefit from the tax changes, a person would need to have an income of over $62,640.AAP FactCheck independently checked the results of the National Party tax calculator and found it was accurate.National has previously stated the tax policy targets the average wage earner, at around $64,000 and the party’s policy states “as a proportion of income, the largest benefit is for someone on the average income of $64,000” (page 2).Mr Goldsmith’s office said this figure was based on the most recent figures from the Stats NZ Quarterly Employment Survey, which shows the average income is $1,231.34 a week, or $64,206 a year.A person earning this income would receive $3227 under the tax cuts.However, Stats NZ’s Household Labour Force Survey shows the median income for wage and salary earners was $1060 a week, or $55,271 a year.A person on the median income would receive $1772 under the tax cuts.The median is the point at which half of earners receive less and half receive more. Stats NZ says “greater emphasis has been put on medians, because extremely high or low incomes tend to have less influence on median amounts than they do on an average (mean) figure”.Stats NZ statistical data analyst Jessica Honey said the Quarterly Employment Survey which National used to calculate the average income “isn’t recommended as an annual income measure”.“It excludes business owners, the self-employed, and industries like farming and NZDF’s military branches,” she told AAP FactCheck.“It also represents a pay week in the middle of each quarter, so can miss short-term jobs, while counting people with multiple jobs several times.”Ms Honey recommended using the latest Household Economic Survey data which showed the average income for all those aged 15 and over was $47,048 and the median income was $33,280 (Table 3).Using this measure, both those on the average and the median income would receive $560 under National’s tax cuts. National’s Paul Goldsmith and Judith Collins have been touting the party’s tax cut plan.","https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA2009/S00159/national-will-cut-taxes-for-hard-working-kiwis.htm,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/426885/election-2020-paul-goldsmith-and-grant-robertson-go-head-to-head-in-finance-debate,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/goldsmith-paul/,https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-rates-for-individuals,https://www.national.org.nz/tax,https://www.national.org.nz/tax-calculator,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/409770/national-keeps-tax-service-cuts-details-secret,https://issuu.com/national33/docs/personal_tax_stimulus_policy,https://drive.google.com/file/d/10roHOc12UCo01C1aajbFOkWCZUMBH7Iu/view?usp=sharing,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/labour-market-statistics-income-june-2020-quarter#:~:text=Comparing%20the%20June%202020%20quarter,%2423%20(6.7%20percent)%20to%20%24364,http://datainfoplus.stats.govt.nz/Item/example.org/438dbf04-3b3f-446a-b575-2f2df7d6531f?_ga=2.246149190.313972835.1601235734-1891321670.1596583718#/example.org/ead41c6f-df6e-4afd-bf28-7c307f813bcb/6#,https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Household-income-and-housing-cost-statistics/Download-data-corrected/household-income-and-housing-cost-statistics-year-ended-june-2019-corrected-25-feb-2020.xlsx",National overstates benefit of NZ tax cut plan,,,,,,

Because she was black they would not publish her work. She died in poverty because she never received a dime for her work. Shakespeare was illiterate and could barely write his own name.”The post includes a painting of a black woman and a partly-visible portrait of Shakespeare with a header which reads, “That’s crazy! I never knew! Smh!”A September 18 version of the post had been viewed more than 16,000 times and attracted more than 90 shares at the time of writing. Other examples of the post can be seen here, here and here. A Facebook post claims William Shakespeare’s plays are in fact the work of Amelia Bassano. The AnalysisThe Facebook post makes a number of false claims, including that Shakespeare’s plays were written by “Amelia Bassano”, a black woman who died unpublished and in poverty. It also claims that Shakespeare was illiterate.The authorship of Shakespeare’s plays has long been the subject of debate, but University of Melbourne associate professor of Shakespeare David McKinnis puts this down to “conspiracy theories”.“There is no evidence whatsoever that anyone other than Shakespeare wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare,” he told AAP Factcheck in an email.“Shakespeare demonstrably read widely and had a grammar school education, which in many regards would exceed today’s tertiary education standards.”Dr McKinnis also provided background on Aemelia Bassano, who was also known as Emilia Lanier.“Emilia Lanier (bap. 1569, d. 1645; daughter of Baptista Bassano, an Italian Jew from Venice) was a real person and a poet, and was a favourite of Elizabeth I, mistress of Henry Carey (the Lord Chamberlain who patronised Shakespeare’s company), and married Captain Alphonso Lanier in 1592.”Regarding the claim that Bassano wrote all of Shakespeare’s plays, Dr McKinnis told AAP FactCheck: “The idea that she was known to all these people and that some elaborate conspiracy of virtually everyone of significance in London in the 17th century would ‘cover-up’ her supposed authorship of Shakespeare’s plays is ridiculous.”Bassano was also a published author in her own right.“Her Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611) was the first book of original poetry – religious verse – published by a woman in England in the seventeenth century. So ‘they would not publish her work’ is pure nonsense,” Dr McKinnis said.The image used in the post is not Aemelia Bassano but a painting by Paolo Veronese with the title: Portrait of a Moorish woman.It is difficult to verify whether Bassano was black. A 2009 paper published in The Oxfordian describes “the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as ‘black’ and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry”.Dr McKinnis said while some sources, including the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, refer to Bassano’s “racial colouring”, that doesn’t necessarily mean she was black.“I imagine it more likely that a Venetian family would have a Mediterranean complexion,” he said.“A Nicholas Hilliard portrait has sometimes been suggested to depict Lanier but the identification isn’t definite by any means.”He also disputed the post’s claim that being black would have prevented Bassano from having her work published.“Being black does not guarantee that a writer wouldn’t be published: the great Roman playwright Terence was born in Carthage (hence ‘Terence the African’) and was black; his works were frequently republished during Shakespeare’s lifetime, his greatness widely acknowledged, and Shakespeare himself used Terence as a source on occasion.”The Facebook post has previously been debunked here and here. An expert told AAP FactCheck there’s no evidence that anyone other than Shakespeare wrote his works.","https://archive.is/JSdHD,https://www.facebook.com/161508346253/posts/10157342255971254,https://www.facebook.com/261027510764037/posts/1818132385053534,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFSIm5XgKo7/,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/148627-david-mcinnis,https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0434.xml,https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/emilia-laniers-salve-deus-rex-judaeorum-1611#,https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/Portrait-of-a-Moorish-woman--bust-length/F8AA6F1A8723F550,https://www.scribd.com/doc/15488374/New-Shakespeare-Theory,https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1070380/an-unknown-woman-portrait-miniature-hilliard-nicholas/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Terence,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/amelia-bassano-william-shakespeare/,https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-evidence-shows-that-aemilia-bassano-was-the-real-shakespeare/?fbclid=IwAR0rTybOaJsdCTKYbZBJpPkf4BXD9IIvgPcxSQv7cjHIuR8r-KZmssp330o",‘Amelia Bassano’ did not write Shakespeare’s plays,,,,,,

But National Party leader Judith Collins has been critical of the policy. During the TVNZ leaders debate on September 22, she said the government’s plans for a new pumped hydro generation scheme to meet the target would lead to higher electricity prices.“That pumped hydro, $30 million being spent on just a business case, and by the way, all that happens, electricity prices go up and that’s what Miss Ardern’s own experts are telling her… According to the experts, 14 per cent up for residential, big numbers for industrial and commercial. That’s what’s happening.”But Labour leader Jacinda Ardern disagreed.“Dealing with our drought years, which is what pumped hydro does, and moving us to 100 per cent renewables, actually brings the price down,” Ms Ardern said.AAP FactCheck examined whether government experts predicted that transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation would lead to a hike in electricity prices, or whether the move would bring prices down.Ms Collins office referred AAP FactCheck to a report by the government’s independent Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) which provided advice to the government on its renewable electricity target.The ICCC commissioned a model to look at the economic impact of meeting the target. It found retail electricity prices could increase by 14 per cent for residential users, 29 per cent for commercial users and 39 per cent for industrial users (Table 4.4, page 57).Wholesale electricity prices could increase from $80 per megawatt hour (MWh) to between $113/MWh and $125/MWh, or a 41 to 56 per cent increase (page 55-56).However, this model was based on achieving 100 per cent renewable electricity by “overbuilding” renewable generation and adding batteries to make up for years when hydro dams were low (page 38). Under the model, the extra renewable generation would mainly come from an increase in geothermal, wind and large scale solar generation (page 48).But the report found pumped hydro storage “shows promise” and recommended the government investigate this further as an alternative (page 98).In July, the government announced it would spend $30 million to develop a business case for a pumped hydro scheme at Lake Onslow as the primary way to meet its renewable energy target. In September the Labour Party said it would spend a further $70 million to accelerate the option if elected.A spokesperson for Ms Ardern said the pumped hydro scheme would be significantly cheaper than the options the ICCC investigated and would lower electricity prices for both consumers and businesses “in the longer term”.Ms Ardern’s office cited a Business Desk article by Dr Keith Turner, who was one of six experts on the ICCC and former CEO of Meridian Energy, NZ’s largest electricity producer. In the article, Dr Turner said the Lake Onslow scheme could lead to lower electricity prices.He said the $4 billion cost of building the scheme could increase electricity prices by 0.5- to -0.75 cents per kilowatt hour, but that savings would likely see wholesale prices drop by twice that amount.This was because the Lake Onslow scheme would reduce reliance on gas and remove the price hikes from hydro electricity during dry years.Ms Ardern’s office also cited a blog post by University of Waikato hydrology professor Earl Bardsley which said the scheme “will tend to depress electricity prices” as it would enable greater use of cheaper hydro-electricity.AAP FactCheck contacted an independent expert, University of Auckland senior economics lecturer Stephen Poletti. Dr Poletti has written multiple papers on New Zealand’s electricity market and is supervising a Masters modelling the economic impact of the Lake Onslow pumped hydro project.He agreed that the scheme would likely decrease electricity prices.Dr Poletti said currently electricity prices increased during dry periods when water in the country’s hydro dams was low. The Lake Onslow scheme would remove these intermittent price hikes, as the power station could sell cheap electricity during these periods.The Lake Onslow reservoir could then be filled via a pump when electricity prices were low, when there was an excess of wind and solar power, and so could operate at a relatively low cost.But Dr Poletti said the impact on prices would depend on how the cost of building the scheme was recouped. If the $4 billion was paid off via a fixed levy on wholesale electricity prices over a long period of time then he said it would likely result in much lower prices.However, if the electricity from Onslow was sold at an inflated price to recoup construction costs over a short period then these benefits may be reduced.The Masters Dr Poletti is supervising has looked at how the scheme would affect prices in 2050 and found it would not have an impact. Labour has pledged to make New Zealand’s electricity generation 100 per cent renewable by 2030.","https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.parliament.nz/media/4487/nzlp___gp_c_s_agreement.pdf,https://www.labour.org.nz/release-renewable-electricity-generation-2030,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96WMzTofHyA&ab_channel=1NEWS,https://youtu.be/96WMzTofHyA?t=1631,https://www.iccc.mfe.govt.nz/what-we-do/our-work/,https://www.iccc.mfe.govt.nz/what-we-do/energy/electricity-inquiry-final-report/,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.iccc.mfe.govt.nz/assets/PDF_Library/daed426432/FINAL-ICCC-Electricity-report.pdf,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/100-renewable-electricity-grid-explored-pumped-storage-%E2%80%98battery%E2%80%99,https://www.labour.org.nz/release-renewable-electricity-generation-2030,https://businessdesk.co.nz/article/keith-turner-time-for-new-nation-building-hydro-project,https://www.iccc.mfe.govt.nz/who-we-are/meet-the-committee/,https://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/#:~:text=100%25%20renewable%20energy%20generation&text=We're%20New%20Zealand's%20largest,the%20future%20of%20our%20planet.,https://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/web,https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/people/spol002",Will pumped hydro result in significant energy price hikes for NZ?,,,,,,

The policy became law in February 2019.National announced its election energy policies on September 19, when party spokesman Jonathan Young told RNZ it would reverse the ban.“Over the past two years we have witnessed a steady increase in energy prices and increased consumption of imported coal as a result of Labour’s ill-thought-out oil and gas ban,” Mr Young said.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Young’s statement that the ban had led to an increase in both energy prices and the consumption of imported coal.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes regular figures on the prices of fuel and electricity, and coal imports and consumption.Figures for the year to June show average petrol prices, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.86 per cent when compared to the year to June 2018.Over the same period, retail diesel prices were up 2.8 per cent but commercial diesel prices were down 4.3 per cent. Fuel oil prices dropped 9.4 per cent.Average gas prices for residential, commercial and industrial users all fell, while there was a small increase in wholesale prices. For example, residential prices were 11.3 per cent lower in 2019/20 than in 2017/18.Many of the energy prices that did increase failed to do so at a steady rate. In the case of petrol prices, the average cost spiked in 2018/19 before falling back 5.3 per cent again in 2019/20.MBIE monitors residential electricity prices by tracking total nationwide residential electricity sales.The sales monitor shows the average price of electricity for the year to March fell three per cent on the 2017/18 figures, after adjusting for inflation.Electricity Authority data shows wholesale electricity prices were 27.3 higher in the year to September 2020 than the same period two years prior. Prices were also highly volatile, spiking in October 2018 before falling again.Figures for the year to June show coal imports of all types increased by 121 per cent between 2017/18 and 2018/19 then decreased 25 per cent the following year. Overall, there was a 65.8 per cent increase over the two years. Consumption fell marginally, decreasing by 0.3 per cent.But did the government’s ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration have any impact on these prices or coal imports?The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government’s oil and gas exploration ban and found it was likely to have an impact on gas and electricity prices only once the current exploration and mining permits expired (page 36).It added that any short-term increases in natural gas and electricity prices had likely been the result of outages at the Pohokura gas field and “deliverability constraints”.The PCE said modelling indicated the ban could increase gas prices, but the impact was “likely to be partially subdued to 2050” (page 37) due to lower consumption.MBIE’s latest annual report on the trends in the energy sector doesn’t mention the oil and gas exploration ban in its summary of the main factors affecting the sector. It identified the key elements influencing the sector as outages at the Pohokura gas field and a volatile oil market due to geopolitical events (page 1).It said gas production was expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining, while oil production was expected to decline (page 43).University of Auckland senior economics lecturer Stephen Poletti, who specialises in the energy sector, said because New Zealand exports most of the oil it produces and consumes imported oil, the ban on offshore oil exploration was unlikely to have an impact on local prices.He said a reduction in domestic gas supply could have an impact on prices, however the exploration ban was not expected to impact supply for at least 10 years.“The possibility of a supply reduction in 10 years time impacting prices today is very hard to imagine,” Dr Poletti said, adding that any increase in electricity prices was due to a reduction in hydro electricity generation caused by drought.Chair of the Sustainable Energy Systems department at Victoria University of Wellington Professor Alan Brent said “there is no correlation between the oil and gas exploration ban and energy prices”.He said the decrease in hydroelectricity generation had led to a short-term increase in coal imports as coal-powered generation was used to make up the shortfall, and this had increased electricity prices.“But consumption of coal outside of electricity generation, for industrial processes, has gone down, and the price is dictated by international movements,” Prof Brent said.Mr Young told AAP FactCheck his statement was only referring to the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, and the consumption of imported coal at the Huntly Power Station – NZ’s only coal-fired power station – which he said had increased.He said a reduction in the supply of gas could increase prices and lead to the power station burning more coal, which would increase electricity prices and coal consumption and imports.MBIE figures show coal-powered energy generation was up 51.6 per cent in the year to June 2020 when compared to the same period in 2017/18. Gas-fired generation was down 10.2 per cent.However, it is not clear that the ban on offshore gas exploration had resulted in a reduction in gas-powered generation in favour of coal as the Pohokura outages have been repeatedly identified as a key influence on supply.Again, the changes were volatile, with coal-fired energy generation spiking in 2018/19 before dropping back again the following year.Mr Young said it was difficult to prove the government’s oil and gas exploration ban had an impact on coal use and wholesale electricity prices. He did not provide any sources to demonstrate the claimed link. New Zealand banned new offshore oil and gas exploration in 2019.","https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/planning-future-no-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-permits,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2018/0047/latest/LMS30905.html,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/election-2020/426458/national-unveils-energy-policy-that-is-better-for-the-environment,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Prices.xlsx,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/energy-statistics-and-modelling/energy-statistics/energy-prices/electricity-cost-and-price-monitoring/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/energy-statistics-and-modelling/energy-statistics/coal-statistics/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/energy-statistics-and-modelling/energy-statistics/energy-prices/electricity-cost-and-price-monitoring/,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/QRSS-june-2020.xlsx,https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Wholesale/Reports/W_P_C?DateFrom=20170922&DateTo=20200922&RegionType=NZ&TimeScale=MONTH&WeightedBy=SIMPLE&_si=v|3,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Coal.xlsx,https://www.pce.parliament.nz/media/197019/report-restricting-the-production-of-fossil-fuels-in-aotearoa-new-zealand.pdf,https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/06/26/131318/gas-production-problems-cost-methanex-2m-a-day?amp=1,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11679-energy-in-new-zealand-2020,https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/people/spol002,https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/ecs/research/chairs/sustainable-energy-systems/people,https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/assets,https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/Data-Files/Energy/nz-energy-quarterly-and-energy-in-nz/Electricity.xlsx",New Zealand’s oil and gas ban hasn’t led to energy price spike,,,,,,

We started on the back foot. National had sold off 6000 (public houses). We’ve created over 5000 public housing places. If we’d been able to build at the pace we are now we would have enough houses for our housing waiting list.” NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, September 22, 2020.The AnalysisNZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the previous National government’s sell-off of state housing stock is behind burgeoning waiting lists.Housing was a key issue of the 2017 New Zealand election in which Jacinda Ardern’s Labour Party-led coalition took power from the Nationals, led by Bill English.In the lead-up to the forthcoming general election on October 17, there has been increased scrutiny of the Ardern government’s record on housing, particularly state housing and the growing waiting list, and the Kiwibuild program. According to the most recent figures, there are 19,438 applicants waiting for public housing in NZ, but Ms Ardern used the TVNZ Leaders’ Debate on September 22 to point the blame at the previous National government.“National had sold off 6000 (public houses). We’ve created over 5000 public housing places. If we’d been able to build at the pace we are now we would have enough houses for our housing waiting list,” she said.AAP FactCheck examined Ms Ardern’s statements about the number of public houses sold and created, and the rate of building. According to a database compiled by Motu Economic and Public Policy Research institute (see table, page 26), in 2008, when Labour was defeated by National, there were 65,324 state houses.In September 2017, when Labour formed a coalition government, there were 63,209 Housing New Zealand properties, according to figures published by Kainga Ora, the government’s Homes and Communities department formed in October 2019. That’s a net reduction of 2115. During its time in government, National undertook a program of new state housing builds, constructing 2960 new properties, according to figures released in July 2019 by Kainga Ora in response to an Official Information Request.However, at the same time, the National government was selling off state housing stocks, some to community housing providers, and some to their state housing tenants (page 10).According to this government report (page 27), Housing NZ-owned stock peaked at 66,127 units during the term of the National government, falling to 60,301 units by mid-2017. This represents a change of 5826 places, which roughly aligns with Ms Ardern’s claim National “sold off 6000”.National’s housing spokeswoman Jacqui Dean told AAP FactCheck it was worth noting of the 6000 homes sold, “a chunk of them went to community housing providers”.“The bulk of social houses we sold were in Tamaki to the Tamaki Development Company, who are owned by a mix of Auckland Council and government,” she said. Ms Ardern’s second claim was that her government had created more than 5000 public housing places.In September 2017, at the time of the election, the total number of public houses available was 66,187, according to this Ministry of Social Development housing quarterly report (page 4).In July 2020, there were 71,524 available public houses, according to Housing and Urban Development’s most recent housing dashboard.That’s an increase of 5337, which roughly supports the prime minister’s claim.However, a spokesman for National housing spokeswoman Jacqui Dean said those new public houses were made possible by the previous government.“When Labour came into government, they were presented with a pipeline of over 5000 public houses,” the spokesman said.“National made the land available for many of those houses, got the projects consented and contracted the early work.”Ms Ardern’s final claim was that if her government had been able to build at the pace they currently are, there would be enough houses for the current housing waiting list.According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development’s July housing dashboard, 3178 state houses have been built between June 2018 and July 2020, an average of 1589 per year. In July 2020, 2756 state houses were under construction.If the latter figure is used as an example of the government’s rate of new builds, the past three years would have yielded a maximum of 8268 homes.However, there were 19,438 applicants on the Housing Register as at July 30, 2020.However, a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister told AAP FactCheck Ms Ardern’s remark was meant to capture what may have occurred if National had spent it’s time in government building new homes at the same rate as the current Labour coalition.‘”What she was saying was that if NZ (which would have been a National government then) had built 2000 houses a year, like we are now, over their nine years we would not have a housing register waitlist.”This echoes similar comments by Labour ministers Phil Twyford and Megan Woods — both of whom have previously said the waiting list would have been met had the previous government built houses at the current rate. National’s Ms Dean told AAP FactCheck: “The June 2017 quarterly housing report notes that MSD was planning for 72,000 social houses to be available by June 2020. So while we were in government we were already planning to have this many houses available.” Almost 20,000 people are waiting to access public housing in NZ.","https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/111014548/kiwibuild-a-major-stumbling-block-for-prime-minister-jacinda-arderns-government,https://vote.nz/voting/get-ready-to-vote/about-the-2020-general-election/?ref=vote-cta-1,https://www.kiwibuild.govt.nz/about/about-kiwibuild/,https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Community-and-Public-Housing/Follow-our-progress/Monthly-Dashboards-2020/July-2020-monthly-update.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf33B_cUzRA,http://motu-www.motu.org.nz/wpapers/10_13.pdf,https://kaingaora.govt.nz/assets/Publications/Archive-Managed-and-Vacant-docs/Managed-Stock-September-2017.pdf,https://kaingaora.govt.nz/about-us/,https://kaingaora.govt.nz/assets/Publications/OIAs-Official-Information-Requests/July-2019/OIA-9-July-2019-number-of-state-houss-built.pdf,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/65495215/government-to-sell-1000---2000-state-houses---john-key,http://motu-www.motu.org.nz/wpapers/10_13.pdf,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-02/A%20Stocktake%20Of%20New%20Zealand%27s%20Housing.pdf,https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2017/new-zealand-2017-general-election-official-results/,https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/work-programmes/social-housing/housing-quarterly-report-dec2017.pdf,https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/News-and-Resources/Statistics-and-Research/Housing-Dashboard-2020/Housing-Dashboard-July-2020.pdf,https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/News-and-Resources/Statistics-and-Research/Housing-Dashboard-2020/Housing-Dashboard-July-2020.pdf,https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Community-and-Public-Housing/Follow-our-progress/Monthly-Dashboards-2020/July-2020-monthly-update.pdf,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/100039478/government-announces-end-to-state-home-sell-off,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/dashboard-tracks-housing-progress",Labour and National both claim credit for NZ public housing rise,,,,,,

In the short time we’ve had, we’ve improved those so that seven are now better.”Jacinda Ardern, Labour Party leader and NZ Prime Minister, September 22, 2020.The AnalysisNZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has defended her government’s response to child poverty, saying they have turned around a trend of increasing poverty.During the last election campaign in 2017, Ms Ardern said her goal was to end child poverty. Once elected, the Labour coalition passed legislation setting targets to reduce child poverty and it now reports annually on a range of child poverty indicators (see key facts table).But Ms Ardern’s government has been criticised for its progress so far.During the TVNZ leaders debate on September 22, NZ National leader Judith Collins said the government had done nothing to address child poverty, but Ms Ardern rejected that claim. (video mark 1hr 22min 25sec)“When we came into government, of all of the (child poverty) measures we use – and we use about nine – seven of them were getting worse,” Ms Ardern said.“In the short time we’ve had, we’ve improved those so that seven are now better.”AAP FactCheck examined the statement that seven child poverty measures were getting worse before the Labour coalition government came to power, and that seven measures had improved since that time.Stats NZ released the first statistics on child poverty in February, which includes three primary measures and six supplementary measures.The latest figures cover the year to June 2019 and show seven measures did improve on the previous year, one measure was unchanged, and one measure (material hardship) increased by 0.2 percentage points.However, in the ‘key facts’ summary of the report, it states that while some measures had declined slightly, the changes were “not statistically significant”.Stats NZ also cautioned against using the survey to look at year-on-year changes due to the margin of error in the survey used.“We encourage users to look at trends over several years,” it said. “Small changes year-on-year are unlikely to be statistically significant because they fall within the range of expected uncertainty.”Stats NZ also pointed out the figures only cover part of Labour’s first year in government, and include some of National’s last year in government.This is because the figures are based on the Household Economic Survey, which is conducted throughout the year and asks participants about their economic position over the previous 12 months.The 2018/19 survey captures information about people’s situation between July 2017 and June 2019, including three months of the previous National government.Victoria University of Wellington public policy Professor Jonathan Boston co-chaired the government’s Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty in 2012 and has written and co-authored several books on the topic.He previously told AAP FactCheck that because of the way the survey is conducted, the most recent statistics cannot be used to establish whether child poverty has increased or decreased under the Labour coalition.The 2019/20 survey will be the first to cover an entire year of the Labour coalition and this isn’t expected to be released until early 2021.However Treasury forecasts suggest child poverty rates had reduced significantly before COVID-19 and the government was “broadly on track” to meet two out of three of its three-year targets before the pandemic. (Treasury said it wasn’t possible to model progress on material hardship).But were seven child poverty measures getting worse when the government came to power?Data from Stats NZ measures chnages in child poverty rates from July 2012 to end of June 2019 (see table view). The statistics covering the period prior to the enactment of the Child Poverty legislation were retrospectively calculated from Household Economic Surveys conducted at the time.The Labour coalition formed on October 19, 2017.Child poverty figures for the year ending June 2017 show six measures improved on the previous year (measure a, b, e, f, g, and h) and three measures were worse (measures c, i and j).The figures for the year ending June 2018 – encompassing the period the Labour coalition came to government – show seven measures were getting worse compared with the previous year.Looking at trends over a longer period, the results are mixed.Of the three primary measures, Stats NZ noted measure ‘a’ had “remained fairly constant” since 2012/13, measure ‘b’ had shown a gradual decline since 2014/15 and one measure ‘c’ “has stayed at similar levels since 2015/16”.Of the six supplementary measures, five (measure e, f, g, i and j) showed no trend up or down since 2012/13, while one (measure ‘h’) had been consistently declining since 2015/16. Treasury forecasts suggest NZ child poverty rates had reduced significantly before COVID-19.","https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/jacinda-arden-s-goal-end-child-poverty.html,https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/reducing-child-poverty/child-poverty-reduction-and-wellbeing-legislation#:~:text=The%20Child%20Poverty%20Reduction%20Act%202018%20requires%20the%20government%20of,set%20of%20child%20poverty%20measures&text=report%20on%20child%20poverty%20related%20indicators.,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96WMzTofHyA&ab_channel=1NEWS,https://youtu.be/96WMzTofHyA?t=4941,https://www.stats.govt.nz/,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/Jonathan.Boston,https://www.bwb.co.nz/authors/jonathan-boston,https://www.aap.com.au/no-support-for-national-leaders-child-poverty-claims/,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/wellbeing/child-poverty-report/trends-prior-to-covid-19.htm,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/341958/honour-and-a-privilege-jacinda-ardern",Can NZ PM Jacinda Ardern claim success on child poverty trends?,,,,,,

The post goes on to suggest the claimed financial strife might behind Victoria’s strict coronavirus lockdown.The post, shared by celebrity chef Pete Evans, features a picture of the premier accompanied by a series of claims that he has sold various assets to China.The post goes on to say that Mr Andrews had “borrowed too much and now can’t pay the interest on the loan, now Victoria is in default to the IMF”.“Did Premier Andrews accept the multi million dollar bribe from the IMF, conditional on Andrews locking down the state of Victoria unnecessarily?,” it adds.In his caption, Evans poses the question: “True or false? A simple search will give you the answers. Then look into NZ.”At the time of writing, the September 22 post had been viewed more than 56,000 times and shared more than 490 times, attracting more than 1400 reactions and 350 comments. A Facebook post falsely claims Victoria is “in default” to the IMF. The AnalysisWhile Victoria’s economy has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the state has not borrowed money from the IMF – which only lends to national governments – nor is it in default.Both the International Monetary Fund and Victorian government confirmed the IMF claim was false when contacted by AAP FactCheck.To battle the coronavirus pandemic and its deadly second wave, the Victorian government passed emergency legislation to make up to $24 billion available for business support and stimulus.However despite the economic hit, the state government has been able to borrow money on financial markets at minimal costs.According to the Treasury Corporation of Victoria, which handles the state government’s borrowing, the interest rate on its three-year bonds was 0.31 per cent at the end of August – down from the rate in July, and only slightly above the rate for the equivalent federal government bonds.The IMF, which is responsible to 189 member countries including Australia, is tasked with maintaining stability in the international financial system. In doing so, it provides emergency loans to countries struggling to pay their debts, often in cases where they are unable to borrow affordably on international markets.As of August 31, the IMF had outstanding loans to 90 members, which are mostly developing countries and financial crisis-hit nations such as Argentina. Neither Victoria nor Australia appear on the list.An IMF spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email the organisation does not lend money at state, provincial or municipal levels, and it works exclusively with national governments.“The state of Victoria has neither borrowed money from the IMF nor is it in default to the Fund,” the spokesperson said.A spokesman for the Victorian government also rubbished the post’s loan default and “bribe” claims. “These claims are completely and utterly false,” he told AAP FactCheck via email.The post also includes a number of other false or misleading claims about Victoria and Mr Andrews’ dealings with China.While it correctly states the premier signed the state up to the Belt and Road initiative, it falsely says that he “sold the rights to water to China” and “sold the farms to China”, among other allegations.Just 3.4 per cent of Victoria’s total water entitlements on issue were owned by any foreign entity in June 2019, the lowest share for any Australian state, according to the national register.Similarly, only 5.7 per cent of Victoria’s agricultural land area was held by any foreign interest, according to the most recent register. That was the second-lowest share for any state, behind only NSW/ACT. The registers do not provide state-level figures for the sources of foreign ownership. A post alleges a bribe from the IMF was conditional on Premier Daniel Andrews locking down Victoria.","https://archive.vn/zYFgz,https://www.aap.com.au/medical-experts-mull-next-virus-strategy/,https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/IMF-Lending,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/daniel-andrews-says-it-s-a-great-day-for-victoria-as-coronavirus-cases-plummet-to-a-three-month-low,https://www.vic.gov.au/members-parliament-victoria-annual-adjustment-determination-2020/economic-factors,https://www.tcv.vic.gov.au/tcv-bonds/interest-rates,https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx,https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/IMF-at-a-Glance,https://www.imf.org/external/about/lending.htm,https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extcred2.aspx?date1key=2020-08-31&reportdate=2020-08-31,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10991.pdf,https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/regional-integration/brief/belt-and-road-initiative,https://firb.gov.au/sites/firb.gov.au/files/2020-05/2019-rfo-water-entitlements.pdf,https://firb.gov.au/sites/firb.gov.au/files/2020-06/2019-rfo-agriculturalland.pdf",Victoria did not take an IMF ‘bribe’ in return for lockdown,,,,,,

I mean what does that tell you? I mean for goodness sake, and their economy is booming and you can go to the rugby.” (3min 29sec)AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins’ claim every Australian state bar Victoria had fewer COVID-19 deaths than NZ, and also looked at the economic situations of both NSW and NZ.Latest figures from the World Health Organisation and the NZ Ministry of Health put New Zealand’s death toll from COVID-19 at 25.As of 9pm (AEST) on September 20, figures from the Australian government’s Department of Health confirmed the COVID-19 death toll as 761 in Victoria, 53 in NSW, 13 in Tasmania, nine in Western Australia, six in Queensland, four in South Australia, three in the Australian Capital Territory, with none in the Northern Territory.While Ms Collins correctly stated the COVID-19 death toll for WA was nine, the figures above confirm NSW has recorded more than twice the number of COVID-19 deaths in NZ (as at September 21), refuting Ms Collins’ assertion NSW had fewer fatalities than her entire nation.Ms Collins’ claim the NSW “economy is booming” is also not supported, with analysts from Deloitte confirming NSW is in a technical recession along with the rest of Australia.Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on September 2, 2020 show Australia’s Gross Domestic Product fell 7.0 per cent in the June quarter, the largest quarterly fall on record. That followed a fall of 0.3 per cent in the March quarter 2020.New Zealand too is in a recession. Figures from Stats NZ on September 17, 2020 show the economy shrunk by 12.2 per cent in the June 2020 quarter. That followed a 1.4 per cent fall in the first quarter.She was correct to state NSW’s population is higher than that of New Zealand, with figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing NSW had 8.129 million residents at December 31, 2019, compared to New Zealand’s estimated population of 5,025,000 at June 30, 2020, according to Stats NZ.Furthermore, Ms Collins was right to say rugby fans can attend games in NSW, with a Rugby Australia spokesperson stating limits on crowd numbers varied “venue to venue” depending on their size, and restrictions by state and other governing bodies.A NSW government COVID-19 website says major recreation facilities are permitted to have up to 25 per cent of normal capacity of the venue or 10,000 persons (whichever is lesser) when admission is by way of a ticket and each person assigned to a seating area. Fans attend the Super Rugby match between the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds.","https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/current-alert-level/,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/gross-domestic-product-june-2020-quarter,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/09/nz-election-2020-judith-collins-expecting-dire-news-at-pre-election-economic-update.html,https://covid19.who.int/table,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-numbers,https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/economics/articles/nsw-economy-benefits-opening-up.html,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-national-income-expenditure-and-product/latest-release#:~:text=Australian%20Gross%20Domestic%20Product%20,https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/economic-downturn-historical-context,https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-national-income-expenditure-and-product/mar-2020,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/gross-domestic-product-june-2020-quarter,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/gross-domestic-product-march-2020-quarter,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3101.0Media%20Release1Dec%202019?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=3101.0&issue=Dec%202019&num=&view=,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/national-population-estimates-at-30-june-2020,https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/what-you-can-and-cant-do-under-rules",Has NSW weathered the impacts of COVID-19 better than NZ?,,,,,,

Because insisting on human rights is not only selfish, it’s stupid.”The quote is attributed to: “Daniel Andrews – Premier of Victoria, September 2020”.The user’s caption reads: “Nothing should stand above human rights. Nothing!”The post had been viewed more than 50,000 times and attracted more than 1300 likes and 200 comments at the time of publication. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews did not make this statement about human rights. The AnalysisThe quote attributed to Daniel Andrews originated in a satirical article mocking the premier’s response to the pandemic, with a Victorian government spokeswoman confirming Mr Andrews never made the statement included in the post.Amid the state’s COVID-19 second wave, the Victorian government imposed strict lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, including a curfew and limits on the distance people can travel from their homes.However some Victorian residents have voiced their displeasure at the measures, taking to the streets during “Freedom Day” protests against the restrictions. Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson has reportedly written to human rights organisations asking for an investigation into the rules which, he claims, could be a breach of human rights legislation.Daniel Andrews previously responded to calls the curfew restrictions violated human rights by saying: “it’s not about human rights, it’s about human life”.The quote misattributed to Mr Andrews in the Instagram post originally appeared in a satirical article published by The Spectator Australia on September 15. The article is titled: “If you don’t want to be kicked in the head, don’t put your head under a jackboot. It’s not only selfish, it’s stupid.”In its first line, the piece includes the disclaimer: “Drongo alert: what follows is satire.” This section of text is written in bold and italicised.The article includes comments, purportedly made by Mr Andrews, that a heavy-handed police response to demonstrations “can be avoided if people don’t protest”.“In fact, you’d be surprised at how much can be avoided if people stop insisting on their personal freedoms. Because insisting on human rights is not only selfish, it’s stupid,” it goes on to quote Mr Andrews as saying.The satirical quote appears to be drawn from Mr Andrews’ statement at a September 13 media conference, during which he was asked about police actions in response to several incidents during the COVID-19 outbreak.Regarding one incident involving a protester, Mr Andrews said: “Much of this, sorry, all of this, can be avoided if people don’t protest, because protesting is not only selfish, it’s stupid.”However, this comment was made in the context of protests taking place during the state’s COVID-19 lockdown and cannot be taken as a general position, nor does it include any disparaging reference to people “insisting on personal freedoms” or “human rights”.The Instagram post in question uses the identical satirical quote but fails to label it as satire. The same account has previously posted an image calling the COVID-19 pandemic “the greatest medical fraud in world history”.A Victorian government spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck Mr Andrews did not make the statement included in the Instagram post.“This is not a comment from the Premier,” the spokeswoman said in an email.The Spectator piece mocks the Victorian premier’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also includes fake quotes from Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. Daniel Andrews was the subject of a satirical article for his handling of the pandemic.","https://archive.is/vLOBw ,https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/first-step-restrictions-metropolitan-melbourne-covid-19 ,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/victoria-police-frustrated-with-selfish-anti-lockdown-protesters,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/daniel-andrews-defends-victoria-s-coronavirus-curfew-amid-human-rights-questions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/11/daniel-andrews-dismisses-human-rights-complaint-over-melbourne-covid-curfew,https://www.spectator.com.au/2020/09/if-you-dont-want-to-be-kicked-in-the-head-dont-put-your-head-under-a-jackboot-its-not-only-selfish-its-stupid/,https://youtu.be/zTNR1B4ZcLU,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/melbourne-to-stay-under-stage-4-lockdown-until-end-of-september-as-coronavirus-roadmap-revealed,https://www.instagram.com/p/CE8btDDJe-S/",Fake Daniel Andrews quote wrongly loses satire label,,,,,,

Seriously?” and had been shared more than 150 times at the time of writing. A Facebook post featuring the fake UN agenda goals The AnalysisThe New World Order document featured in the Facebook post outlines 23 different mission goals attributed to the UN, however the document was not drafted by the UN nor do the goals align with the agendas it references.UN Agenda 21 refers to a non-binding resolution agreed to at the UN’s 1992 Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. The resolution aims for nations to take a holistic approach to social, economic and environmental change, proposes possible solutions for global problems and aims to empower previously disenfranchised groups.However since its inception, Agenda 21’s 31 goals for sustainable development have been targeted by conspiracists.A 2014 report from the Southern Poverty Law Centre, a US-based civil rights group with a background in monitoring extremism, outlines how conspiracy theories have surrounded Agenda 21 for years.“Agenda 21 has been transformed in much of the American public mind into a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government, a nefarious effort to crush freedom in the name of environmentalism,” the report says.The document shown in the Facebook post also includes 2030 in the headline – likely a reference to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda is a list of economic and social goals including ending all poverty, ending world hunger and achieving global gender equality.In an email to AAP FactCheck, a UN spokeswoman said the document included in the Facebook post was “not a genuine UN document”.Variations of the post have been circulating social media globally for months. This version of the post, with some areas circled, is the same false image previously debunked by a number of factchecking outlets – see here, here and here.Although there are superficial elements of the post’s claims mentioned in the two relevant documents, the mission goals listed are not part of either Agenda 21 nor 2030 Agenda.For example, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development does suggest promoting the research and distribution of vaccines but does not include the goal of mandatory vaccination of the population.The UN also makes the point that Agenda 21 and the 2030 Agenda are not legally binding. False claims the UN has a secret agenda to create a new world order are circulating social media.","https://archive.is/Drbx2 ,https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/outcomedocuments/agenda21,https://www.splcenter.org/20140331/agenda-21-un-sustainability-and-right-wing-conspiracy-theory ,https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/24/viral-image/facebook-post-distorts-uns-sustainable-development/,https://factcheck.afp.com/hoax-circulates-about-united-nations-mission-goals,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/23/fact-check-uns-agenda-21-2030-agenda-wont-create-new-world-order/5474884002/,https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/",Fake UN document used to spread false ‘new world order’ goals,,,,,,
128,,,,Mostly True,,2020-09-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/tourism-lockdown-linked-to-deep-new-zealand-recession/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation:Is New Zealand’s recession worse than Australia’s due to a dependence on international tourism and strict COVID-19 lockdowns?The Statement“(It is) because New Zealand’s lockdown was stricter during this period (April to June) than it was in Australia, but also secondly because tourism is a much larger percentage of our economy than it is of the Australian economy. So if you put those two things together most economists are predicting it (economic growth) will be (lower).”Grant Robertson, Finance Minister, September 14, 2020.The AnalysisAs the impact of COVID-19 begins to bite, there is debate around why the economic fallout in New Zealand has been greater than that experienced in Australia.Figures for the June quarter show Australia has officially entered a technical recession for the first time in nearly 30 years, with the economy contracting by seven per cent.New Zealand’s economy was expected to fare even worse, with the major banks predicting a contraction of between 10.5 and 13 per cent. The country’s June quarter GDP figures, released on September 17, confirmed it had contracted by 12.2 per cent.Ahead of the release of these figures, NZ politicians and commentators (here, here and here) speculated as to whether the country would be better off if it had followed Australia’s approach to COVID-19 lockdowns.During an interview on Heather du Plessis-Allan Drive on NewstalkZB on Monday September 14, Finance Minister Grant Robertson was asked why New Zealand’s economy was expected to perform worse in the June quarter than Australia’s economy.“(It is) because New Zealand’s lockdown was stricter during this period than it was in Australia, but also secondly because tourism is a much larger percentage of our economy than it is of the Australian economy,” he said. (Audio mark 1min 30 secs).AAP FactCheck examined Mr Robertson’s statement in relation to the three months to June 30.Official data shows New Zealand’s economy is significantly more reliant on tourism than Australia.The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show tourism made up 3.1 per cent of Australia’s GDP,  8.2 per cent of exports (which captures international tourism consumption in Australia),  with 5.2 per cent of the country’s workforce employed in the tourism industry.By contrast, the latest figures from Stats NZ show tourism accounted for 5.8 per cent of New Zealand’s GDP, while industries supporting tourism accounted for an additional 4 per cent.Tourism also made up a greater share of New Zealand’s exports, accounting for 20.4 per cent of exports – making it the country’s largest export industry in 2019, with 8.4 per cent of the country’s workforce employed in tourism.A total of 42 per cent of NZ’s tourism spending comes from overseas tourists.Using the related measure of tourism consumption, the contribution made by international visitors to Australia was 26 per cent of overall tourism consumption.Economics commentator and former ANZ Bank chief economist Cameron Bagrie said New Zealand’s reliance on tourism and its stricter lockdown explained the different economic performances of New Zealand and Australia.However, he said the impact of COVID-19 on tourism was overstated because official figures didn’t account for money New Zealanders normally spend overseas remaining in NZ due to border closures.“The significance of tourism to the economy is massively overplayed,” Mr Bagrie said.It should be noted Australia’s domestic tourism industry may be more affected by the country’s COVID-19 restrictions as state borders have largely been closed, whereas domestic travel in New Zealand has been less restricted.But do the countries’ differing COVID-19 lockdowns also explain why Australia’s economy performed better in the second quarter?It is difficult to compare the economic impact of the lockdowns as New Zealand’s COVID-19 response is run by central government, while each Australian state develops its own response with different durations and stringencies.However, researchers at Oxford University have developed a Covid Stringency Index as part of their Our World in Data program which compares countries’ overall responses to COVID-19.The index rates the stringency of a country’s approach based on nine indicators, including school closures, workplace closures and travel bans, and expresses this as a number on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the strictest.Figures for April to June 30 2020 show New Zealand had a more severe lockdown than Australia for the first 43 days, or 47.7 per cent, of the June quarter, but was more liberal for the next 47 days, or 52.2 per cent of the quarter.When the figures are averaged over the three month period, it shows, overall, New Zealand had a slightly more liberal approach, getting a 58.5 rating, compared to Australia, at 64.Infometrics senior economist Brad Olsen said while New Zealand did have lighter restrictions on average, it took time for economic activity to pick up after the strict level four lockdown at the start of the quarter, and the index may underestimate the impact that had.“From a business perspective, being locked down for four-and-a-half weeks of normal operation means you essentially lose momentum,” Mr Olsen said.“So although you might have slightly more liberal settings over the period, you are going from a colder start so it is more likely to have more of an impact over the quarter than the stringency index may suggest.”The Reserve Bank estimated 37 per cent of the country’s economy would not be able to operate under level four lockdown, compared with 19 per cent under level three (table 1, page 2).But overall, Mr Olsen agreed that tourism and the lockdown were the two main factors that explained why the country’s economic growth lagged behind Australia’s in the June quarter.Sense Partners economist Shamubeel Eaqub also believed that tourism and the lockdown were the main factors.“We did have a harder lockdown in (the June quarter) and border flows (tourism and immigration) matter more to New Zealand than Australia,” Mr Eaqub said. NZ has entered a deeper recession than Australia, with some blaming its greater reliance on tourism.","https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/C9973AC780DDFD3FCA257F690011045C?OpenDocument,https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/recession.html#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20definition%20of,negative%20growth%20in%20real%20GDP.&text=Consequently%2C%20two%20consecutive%20quarters%20of,underlying%20pace%20of%20economic%20growth.,https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300106701/here-comes-new-zealands-biggest-quarterly-gdp-drop-ever,https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/covid-19-sees-record-12-2-percent-fall-in-new-zealands-economy,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12364329,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12363666,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/122791359/election-2020-judith-collins-fears-brain-drain-to-australia-after-covid19-economic-shock,https://www.iheart.com/podcast/211-heather-du-plessis-allan-24837940/episode/grant-robertson-this-will-be-the-71437888/,https://www.tra.gov.au/economic-analysis/economic-value/national-tourism-satellite-account/national-tourism-satellite-account,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/tourism-satellite-account-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/,https://www.tra.gov.au/economic-analysis/economic-value/national-tourism-satellite-account/national-tourism-satellite-account,https://bagrieeconomics.co.nz/#cb,https://www.interstatequarantine.org.au/state-and-territory-border-closures/,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?time=2020-01-22..latest,https://ourworldindata.org/about,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?tab=chart&time=2020-04-01..2020-06-30&country=AUS~NZL&region=Oceania,https://www.infometrics.co.nz/team_member/brad-olsen/,https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/reservebank/files/publications/analytical%20notes/2020/an2020-04.pdf,http://www.sense.partners/shamubeel-eaqub","Tourism,

And Victoria is the only state in Australia to sign on.”“Why do you think the Police at Melbourne’s Freedom Day Rally acted like goons, were dressed in black and didn’t have the Australian logo on their uniforms?” it said.The post also features an image of two police officers standing in front of a police vehicle wearing protective armour and holding guns.At the time of writing, the post had been viewed more than 15,000 times and shared on more than 2,400 occasions, accumulating more than 900 comments and 700 reactions. Victoria Police has not been privatised via the Strong Cities Network, as claimed on social media. The AnalysisWhile Victoria is a member city of the Strong Cities Network, this has no impact on the operations of Victoria Police, which continues to be owned by, and accountable to, Victoria’s government.The police force had not been privatised nor outsourced, a spokesperson for the Victorian police minister told AAP FactCheck.The SCN says it is not about diminishing, circumventing, or removing the mandate of local actors and any policies adopted by member cities are based on their own decisions and responsibilities.The SCN’s lead organisation also told AAP FactCheck it is not connected to any multilateral organisations like the United Nations and does not govern or influence how police forces carry out their duties.Multiple anti-lockdown “Freedom Day” protests have taken place across Melbourne with residents pushing back against the state’s COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.The demonstrations resulted in many protesters being arrested and fined by Victoria Police, with the post saying officers had “acted like goons, were dressed in black and didn’t have the Australian logo on their uniforms”. The statement was made in support of its claim the force had been privatised and was being governed by global NGOs.The Strong Cities Network (SCN) is a global group of policy leaders who collaborate to reduce extremism, hate and violence in local communities by sharing experiences and expert training.The state of Victoria is the only Australian territory listed among the group’s 140-member network.In a document titled Strong Cities Network: Myth-busting, the network said it “does NOT force its members to highlight, endorse, or accept existing countering violent extremism policies”.“The Strong Cities Network is only a network – the policies that members accept are their own decisions and responsibilities … Members only sign up to principles that protect the rights and civil liberties of their communities – and nothing more,” it said.“The Strong Cities Network is NOT about diminishing, circumventing, or removing the mandate of local actors.”The SCN is led by independent UK-based think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which is dedicated to understanding and coming up with real-world solutions to the issue of polarisation, hate and extremism, according to its website.“Membership of the SCN is designed to help city leaders talk to one another across international borders and ensure all public services can draw on their peers’ experiences in how to build resilient communities,” an ISD spokesperson told AAP FactCheck via email.“SCN initiatives are not led by police, nor do they in any way govern or influence how cities or local governments, including local police forces, carry out their duties.”The Victoria Police annual report states it is a “wholly owned and controlled entity of the state of Victoria”. The report adds it is governed by the Victoria Police Act 2013 and answers to the minister for police and emergency services.Victoria’s Department of Justice and Emergency Services rejected the central claim of the post.“Victoria Police has not been privatised under Victoria’s membership to the Strong Cities Network,” a spokesperson for the department said. Victoria Police made a series of arrests at anti-lockdown Freedom Day rallies in Melbourne.","https://archive.is/crX8G ,https://www.isdglobal.org/isdapproach/,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dozens-arrested-as-police-face-off-with-anti-lockdown-protesters-at-melbourne-market,https://strongcitiesnetwork.org/en/about-the-scn/,https://strongcitiesnetwork.org/en/strong-cities/member-cities/,https://strongcitiesnetwork.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Strong-Cities-Network_Mythbusting.pdf ,https://www.isdglobal.org/isdapproach/ ,https://www.police.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-11/VicPol%20Annual%20Report%202019%20Accessible.pdf",Victoria’s police force has not been privatised,,,,,,

The swab targets the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose.The Australian guidelines for this test indicate the swab should be inserted 2 to 3 cm, or until resistance is met. The resistance occurs when the swab meets the back of the nasopharynx. Between the nasopharynx and the brain is the ethmoid bone.Dr. Eric Levi, an ear, nose and throat specialist based in Melbourne and a member of the Australian Society of Otorlaryngology Head and Neck Surgery,  told AAP FactCheck in an email that a correctly performed nasal swab cannot harm the brain.“A properly performed nasal swab by a clinician will not cause damage to the brain,” Dr Levi told AAP FactCheck.“The roof of the nose and the floor of the brain is well protected by bony structures. As of 16 September 2020, Australia has performed 7.12 million nasal swabs and so far there has been no documented case of brain injury.”Dr Morgan Katz, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press it isn’t possible for a swab to enter the brain.The swab “would have to go through layers of muscle and fascia, as well as the base of the skull, which is a thick bone, in order to get anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, and I would say that it is not possible,” Katz told The Associated Press.Similar claims about the COVID-19 nasal swab test have been debunked here and here. Dr. Jürgen Götz of The University of Queensland and Dr Alan Woodruff of the Queensland Brain Institute have written about the blood-brain barrier, and how it provides a defence against disease.“As the name suggests, this is a barrier between the brain’s blood vessels (capillaries) and the cells and other components that make up brain tissue. Whereas the skull, meninges and cerebrospinal fluid protect against physical damage, the blood–brain barrier provides a defence against disease-causing pathogens and toxins that may be present in our blood,” Dr Gotz and Dr Woodruff said in their essay.The image on the Facebook post includes a link to the Telegram account of  Freiheitliche Aufklärung (translated as “Freedom Education”) which claims to offer “Enlightenment about the Satanic New World Order & New Age Agenda.” A Facebook post claims COVID-19 nasal swabs can damage the brain.","https://archive.is/1CgQH,https://teachmeanatomy.info/neuroanatomy/structures/meninges/#:~:text=The%20meninges%20refer%20to%20the,the%20cerebral%20and%20cranial%20vasculature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292164/,https://www.facebook.com/openyoureyespeople.emoaf/photos/a.545396378806035/4010125388999766/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/Drinkingthroughthenose/posts/3544188725608598?_ga=2.34348713.901980317.1600150543-1013414858.1597027482,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158855373458756&set=a.10151656383908756&type=3,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/assessment-and-testing-covid-19/how-covid-19-testing-works,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmvcm2010260,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/08/phln-guidance-on-laboratory-testing-for-sars-cov-2-the-virus-that-causes-covid-19.pdf,https://teachmeanatomy.info/head/osteology/ethmoid-bone/,https://ericlevi.com/,http://www.asohns.org.au/,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:9084880850,https://sciencefeedback.co/claimreview/nasal-swab-used-for-covid-19-testing-does-not-reach-the-brain/,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/covid-19-nasal-swab-test-does-not-cause-risk-of-infection/,https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/brain-anatomy/what-blood-brain-barrier,https://t.me/s/freiAuf","COVID-19 nasal swabs do not harm the brain, doctors say",,,,,,
131,,,,Mostly False,,2020-09-14,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/lockdown-critic-says-covid-19-is-only-slightly-worse-than-the-flu/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation:Is the fatality rate for COVID-19 only marginally worse than the seasonal flu?The Statement“The Ioannidis study shows the death rate (for COVID-19) is only very marginally worse than the standard flu viruses that kill hundreds of sick and elderly New Zealanders every year.”Simon Thornley, senior lecturer in epidemiology, University of Auckland. September 6, 2020. The AnalysisA group calling for New Zealand to relax restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 claims the virus is only marginally worse than the seasonal flu.The assertion was made by COVID Plan B, a group of six academics including three health science lecturers. The group has called for an end to COVID-19 lockdowns, arguing the risks of the virus have been overstated and lockdowns are more harmful than the virus itself.During an interview on TVNZ’s Q+A with Jack Tame on September 6, group representative and University of Auckland epidemiology lecturer Simon Thornley said New Zealand’s COVID-19 response was driven by fear and panic and was unwarranted and irrational. (Video mark 1min).“The Ioannidis study shows the death rate is only very marginally worse than the standard flu viruses that kill hundreds of sick and elderly New Zealanders every year,” Dr Thornley said.“The response should be a measured one, like we’ve planned for lower mortality pandemics, not lockdowns.“We’ve sacrificed our humanity, our society and our economy for the wrong virus.”AAP FactCheck examined Dr Thornley’s statement that the death rate for COVID-19 is only marginally worse than the seasonal flu.Dr Thornley said his statement was based on a July 14, 2020 report by Stanford University epidemiology professor John P.A Ioannidis.The non-peer reviewed report provides a meta analysis of 36 studies which looked at the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in populations to determine the portion that had been infected by the virus.This can be used to more accurately calculate the proportion of people who die after catching the virus, which is called the infection fatality ratio (IFR).Dr Ioannidis found the studies had an estimated IFR ranging from 0 per cent to 1.63 per cent, and a median of 0.27 per cent. (Page 2)Dr Thornley also directed AAP Factcheck to a study which looked at the prevalence of COVID-19 in the state of Indiana and estimated the IFR was 0.26 per cent. However, that study excluded deaths in nursing home residents which accounted for 54.9 per cent of COVID-19 deaths in the state.Dr Thornley said the IFR for seasonal flu varied, “but are usually quoted at less than 0.5 per cent” and pointed to a 2009 study that said 0.5 per cent was “similar to the upper range” for the fatality rate for the flu. The report cites a webpage from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on influenza as the source of this figure, however this webpage does not currently include flu fatality rates, and the page archives for 2009 also do not show the flu IFR.A flu IFR of 0.5 would be similar to the upper range for COVID-19. However, other research has put the IFR for COVID-19 significantly higher, and the IFR for flu significantly lower.Another non-peer reviewed meta-analysis of COVID-19 infection fatality ratios looked at 24 studies and estimated the IFR at 0.68 per cent – nearly triple that found by Ioannidis. (Page 2)The authors noted a high level of variation between different studies and said their IFR estimate was likely an underestimate. (Page 3).The World Health Organisation (WHO) has found estimates for the IFR for COVID-19 “converging at approximately 0.5 – 1 per cent” based on three studies – two in Switzerland and one in Stockholm, Sweden.By contrast, the WHO says “mortality is usually well below 0.1 per cent” for seasonal influenza, which suggests the fatality rate of COVID-19 is five to 10 times higher than for the flu.Between July 10 and September 9, website archives show the CDC officially estimated the IFR for COVID-19 at 0.0065 deaths per infection, or 0.65 per cent (Table 1). These figures were replaced on September 10 with a breakdown of IFR estimates by age range. Overall CDC figures for the number of flu deaths each year suggest about five times more people have already died from COVID-19 in the US than die from flu in an average year.Between 2010/11 and 2018/19, the number of people in the US who died from the flu each year ranged from 12,000 to 61,000 with an average of 37,462 flu deaths, while the number who had flu symptoms ranged from 9.3m to 45m, for an average of 28.6m (table 1).Using the average figures, which do not include asymptomatic cases, this would put a crude IFR at 0.13 per cent. However one meta-analysis found between 4 and 85 per cent of people with flu are asymptomatic.By contrast, as of September 10, the US had already recorded 188,608  COVID-19 deaths.University of Otago public health professor Nick Wilson has published multiple papers on pandemic influenza in New Zealand and said the IFR for COVID-19 was significantly higher than for seasonal flu.He said while he was not aware of studies which had directly calculated the IFR for the flu, a 2017 study found on average 0.0135 per cent of the population dies from flu each year.As an estimated 10 to 20 per cent of New Zealanders catch seasonal influenza each year, this suggests an IFR between 0.0675 per cent and 0.135 per cent.University of Otago epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker agreed, saying Dr Thornley’s statement is “not supported by the evidence generated in New Zealand”.He said a comprehensive study of influenza rates in the country found about 35 per cent were infected by the virus each year, which would put the IFR for the flu even lower, at about 0.04 per cent.This would mean the fatality rate for COVID-19 was seven times higher than seasonal flu based on Ioannidis’ figures, or nearly 18 times higher based on the 0.68 per cent rate from another meta-analysis, or 16 times higher based on the 0.65 per cent rate cited by the CDC.University of Auckland epidemiologist Professor Rod Jackson was critical of the findings of the Ioannidis study. He said the fatality ratio he used was derived by using the median figure from studies which had vastly divergent results and so was unreliable.“That is a complete no-no for evidence reviews when there are very different estimates from different studies,” Prof Jackson said.He said the studies Ioannidis included in his meta-analysis were also based on specific sub-populations – cities or regions – and tests were conducted over a relatively short period of time, which could also give inaccurate results.Prof Jackson said his own unpublished research found the IFR for COVID-19 was closer to one per cent.He also pointed to other research which looked at the number of COVID-19 deaths in a single week in the US and compared that to the peak number of flu deaths a week in an average year and found COVID-19 was between 9.5 to 44.1 times more deadly. COVID Plan B says lockdown is unwarranted as COVID-19 is only slightly worse than the seasonal flu.","https://www.covidplanb.co.nz/,https://www.covidplanb.co.nz/manifesto/,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/not-lockdowns-controversial-epidemiologist-calls-end-irrational-covid-19-elimination-strategy,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/s-thornley,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3.full.pdf,https://profiles.stanford.edu/john-ioannidis,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-5352,https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2840.short,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fkeyfacts.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/,https://web.archive.org/web/20090101000000*/www.cdc.gov/flu/keyfacts.htm,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4.full.pdf,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/q-a-detail/q-a-similarities-and-differences-covid-19-and-influenza,https://web.archive.org/web/20200909085620/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20200911222029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586318/,https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/us,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024455.html,https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&ik=dfdb0b96ef&attid=0.2&permmsgid=msg-f:1677305106642607906&th=1746fc1b95619f22&view=att&disp=inline&saddbat=ANGjdJ90iS820vucn_GzRND9d70hllXFaLhziojlAJS5Gq7_vMhl1YoqqmBKNWybKx5g3fmICRhaS9v0pTo4TPVFo5cS2qsacgkF4y7q-pOtyOTePsgU-DcopXMJ4nsW8HPh0vvcVc1Tv5WROVD7KDxPzO7t26F7CVI_ysJfQjNJKQG7F9beQ-OX7823UX7ohDORlRI86ftJugz7eI6RFO7SWErh51pQD2OOKCQa2qwrHCPt5CczL6kLt-9eafZwXv88ZlQyXgFXEl8AN-vR00wlPa0d75umHnJclUXatIIzy0OLfNGa8MNKbBHDzjVm3InYpIu_ZCjahbqip1Zb4yYDNvvyr6cAKrUthuH0cR1L12057tU4qobZlMD2b7Kr9-Uwf_y_axjVwYG8W80_FobCsKoPEAfMmJ3yPJbPinsmfmdtZzJbGkL142ZZHumruWWhoOCp5IprFmsVIcjbjGJoKWSyJb-op0aLGX4LrZuhii46RCPVHL6WoyAiUYrGu_5vx5314CYYyaqDydZNqgF_CIGoryWBQJUlOK3JK9JQMQEY1UdR8_9ctXWhaOzuiDewoZRlWx6t7qAMD6A4FufWAAqLcp3Ss_NyKGWGjX881wrm_QZT9b8CIerk0iFV4vuzYda8f6DSoiVg8IsTHKAE2CL7FdM0hUOqAuIwiP9Sjq0zu56YxFOBKsHuT4w,http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/Atmosphere-and-climate/influenza.aspx#:~:text=Influenza%20is%20a%20potentially%20life,and%20spring%20in%20New%20Zealand.,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024831.html,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30016464/,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4.full.pdf,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/r-jackson,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2766121",Lockdown critic says COVID-19 is only slightly worse than the flu,,,,,,

It allows Compulsory Breath Testing (CBT), where drivers are breath-tested at roadside checkpoints, and Mobile Breath Testing after a driver has been pulled over by police. In each scenario, police do not need to suspect a driver is affected by alcohol before testing them.Prior to this, there were eight years of a random stopping program, which allowed a mobile breath test to be conducted after a driver was pulled over. (Page 8)Drug testing is already carried out on drivers who have, for example, been involved in a serious accident, but random testing is now proposed.Mr Smith told AAP FactCheck he was recalling statistics from the Ministry of Transport when he made his recent statement about the impact of RBT.Those Ministry of Transport figures are contained in the Alcohol and Drugs 2017 report, and they show that in 1992 – the year prior to the introduction of RBT – there were 273 fatalities resulting from crashes where a driver was affected by alcohol and/or drugs (Page 8).In 1993, the same year RBT was introduced, there were 227 fatalities from crashes involving drivers impaired by alcohol/drugs – a fall of 17 per cent on the previous year.In 1994 there were 225 alcohol-related road fatalities, a fall of about 18 per cent on the 1992 figure, and in 1995 there were 200, a fall of 27 per cent on the 1992 total.In 1996, three years after the introduction of RBT, there were 148 fatalities resulting from alcohol/drug-related crashes – a drop of 46 per cent on the 1992 figure. In 1997, this remained relatively static at 147 fatalities.It’s not until 1998, when 142 fatalities from crashes with alcohol/drugs as a factor were recorded, that the figures approached half the pre-RBT level (a drop of 48 per cent).This is five years after the introduction of RBT, not three as stated by Mr Smith.When contacted by AAP FactCheck, Mr Smith said: “My source was my recollection of a briefing from Transport officials in 2017 at a Cabinet committee discussion on introducing random roadside drug testing.”“I am confident that the fatalities were halved from random roadside alcohol testing but accept the timeframe in which this was achieved was between three and five years, having re-looked at the data,” he said.Gerald Waters, who authored the report On the Road: Compulsory Breath testing in New Zealand and Interviews with Drink Drivers, and is the research director of Researching Impaired Driving in New Zealand (RIDNZ), told AAP FactCheck Mr Smith was correct that RBT played a significant role in reducing the harm from drink driving.“It is extremely effective not only for drink driving but also as a highly visible police presence with regards to all criminal activity — detection is the frontline for our reductions in the harm caused by drink driving.”He agreed the claim fatalities were halved within three years of the introduction of RBT was an “overestimate”. NZ National are throwing their support behind random drug testing for NZ drivers","https://www.referendums.govt.nz/cannabis/index.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIruSixZfd6wIVin4rCh38EQAMEAAYASAAEgKmA_D_BwE,https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/S7-report-Land-Transport-Drug-Driving-Amendment-Bill.pdf,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/content/tvnz/onenews/story/2020/09/08/attorney-general-says-roadside-drug-testing-law-would-breach-bil.html,https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/Compulsory-Breath-Testing.pdf,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306323566_On_The_Road,https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Research/Documents/6949ac12dd/Alcohol-drugs-2017.pdf,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306323566_On_The_Road","Drink driving fatalities were halved by RBT in NZ, but it took more than three years",,,,,,

TIME TO WAKE UP. The world bank was exporting COVID-19 tests in 2018…2018 people!!!! Apparently we have been told the virus did not exist until December 2019. ONLY 3 months after the non-coincidental EVENT 201 in NY”.The caption also includes a link to the current WITS page, now labelled: Medical Test kits (300215) exports by country in 2018, and with no reference to Covid-19 in the product description column.The post has been viewed more than 280,000 times and shared on more than 150 occasions. A Facebook post claims the World Bank was distributing COVID-19 tests two years before the pandemic. The AnalysisThe World Bank says COVID-19 testing kits were not being exported in 2018, and inaccurate social media claims stemmed from the misinterpretation of a label change made to improve the tracking of common medical equipment now being used to test for COVID-19.Exported products have uniform classification numbers known as Harmonized Commodity Description and Codes, assigned to simplify identification and group items.The World Bank said the World Health Organisation issued a list of medical products in March 2020 which were already in circulation but had become vital to the COVID-19 response.At the same time, the equipment – like diagnostic or laboratory reagents, ventilators and hand sanitisers – was given new HS codes and less technical product descriptions, with the World Bank stating the aim was to make it simpler to track their distribution.WITS is a database developed by the World Bank, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and others, to gather and display international trade and tariff data.An archived version of the WITS webpage from early September 2020 is an exact match to the one shown in the Facebook post.However, changes were made to the WITS website on September 7, 2020.  The archived version of the webpage is titled ‘COVID-19 Test kits (300215) exports by country in 2018’, as shown in the Facebook post. The updated and current version of the webpage, is labelled ‘Medical Test kits (300215) by country in 2018‘.The current version of the webpage and the version shown in the Facebook post both list under Additional Product information: ‘diagnostic reagents based on immunological reactions’.However, the page versions differ under ‘Category’, with the one shown in the Facebook post stating: ‘COVID-19 Test kits/Instruments, apparatus used in Diagnostic Testing’, and the current WITS page showing ‘Medical Test kits’ in place of ‘COVID-19 Test kits’.The current WITS page also differs in that it includes the following explanation: ‘The data here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by the World Customs Organization (WCO) as critical to tackling COVID-19’.It includes a link to a joint document from the World Health Organization and WCO about the updated HS codes.Harmonized System (HS) codes are used by customs authorities around the world as a standardised tracking system. It helps authorities identify products when they assess duties and taxes and for gathering statistics.The codes are updated every five years, with the last general update in 2017.The HS code 300215, which appears against the post’s COVID-19 Test kits and the Medical Test kits currently displayed on the WITS site, relates to “immunological products, put up in measured doses or in forms or packings for retail sale”.Other products unrelated to COVID-19, such as a chromatographic immunoassay kit which is used to detect the presence of drugs in urine, have been classified under this HS code previously.According to the WCO, COVID-19 medical supplies, including testing kits, were added to the 300215 HS code in March 2020 in response to demand in medical supplies and to “help countries speed up the cross-border movement of these critical products”.The World Bank released a statement on September 8 to clarify the “misinformation recently posted on social media”, saying many health products were labelled in technical terms using HS codes prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.It said the WITS used the WCO’s new descriptions, including ‘COVID-19 Test kits’, to create a new database to collate information about key COVID-related medical supplies in one place.“In light of misinterpretations that have occurred in recent days, the labeling in the WITS site has been updated to reflect the reality: COVID-19 tests did not exist before 2020,” the World Bank said.A similar version of the claim has been debunked by an Italian fact-checking unit. A Facebook post claims COVID-19 testing kits were being exported to countries back in 2018.","https://archive.is/GV5yH,http://https/wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/300215?fbclid=IwAR0xC2hesuZ2Ogd2cepSoJ75tM1vdLEvSE_NCaMEAiOZH0VcmKb_1fmUR8o,https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/50018/Harmonized-Commodity-Description-and-Coding-Systems-HS#:~:text=The%20Harmonized%20System%20is%20an,common%20basis%20for%20customs%20purposes.,http://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/facilitation/activities-and-programmes/natural-disaster/covid_19/hs-classification-reference_en.pdf?la=en,https://wits.worldbank.org/about_wits.html ,https://web.archive.org/web/20200906050302if_/https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/300215,https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/300215,https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2018/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/nomen/h5/product/300215,http://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/nomenclature/covid_19/hs-classification-reference_edition-2_en.pdf?la=en ,https://www.trade.gov/harmonized-system-hs-codes#:~:text=Among%20industry%20classification%20systems%2C%20Harmonized,the%20export%20process%20for%20goods.&text=The%20United%20States%20uses%20a,digits%20being%20the%20HS%20number ,https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5368.0.55.022 ,https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-manufacturing/tariff-classification/current-tariff/schedule-3/section-vi/chapter-30 ,https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/ebti/ebti_details.jsp?Lang=en&selectedReference=ESBTIESBTI2018SOL82&reference=ESBTIESBTI2018SOL82&refcountry=&valstartdate=&valstartdateto=&valenddate=&valenddateto=&suppldate=&nomenc=&nomencto=&keywordsearch=&descript=&orderby=&totalRecords=8&linkVal=&viewVal=&keywordmatchrule=&specialkeyword= ,http://www.wcoomd.org/en/media/newsroom/2020/april/joint-wco-who-hs-classification-list-for-covid_19-medical-supplies-issued.aspx,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2020/09/08/statement-on-trade-data-related-to-covid-19-related-medical-supplies,https://www.open.online/2020/09/07/i-kit-test-covid-19-venduti-nel-2018-la-teoria-del-complotto-nata-dallerrore-informatico-del-sito-wits/","COVID-19 testing kits were not being exported in 2018, says World Bank",,,,,,
134,,,,False –,,2020-09-09,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/claims-on-cdc-data-for-covid-19-incorrect-say-experts/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAn Instagram post claims that a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report “shows that 94% of COVID-19 deaths in the US had underlying medical conditions”.The September 1 post features an image of a building with a CDC sign and is accompanied by a caption which reads, “It’s official! ITS (sic) A SCAM. 94% of listed COVID deaths had 2 or MORE severe and life threatening co morbidities.They were also of a ‘very advanced age’. #itsover.” A post claims a report shows that 94% of COVID-19 deaths in the US had underlying medical conditions.The AnalysisSocial media has been circulating claims the CDC “quietly” updated its COVID-19 data and that only six per cent of fatalities were caused solely by the virus with the other 94 per cent having underlying medical conditions. The claims were retweeted by US President Donald Trump before they were removed.However, a closer look at how deaths are reported in the US shows the claims are incorrect. Experts explained to AAP FactCheck that the CDC data shows 94 per cent of COVID-19 victims had at least one additional factor as well as COVID-19 contributing to their death.The experts said the post misinterprets how comorbidities, when more than one disease or condition is present in a person at the same time, are recorded in the CDC’s COVID-19 data.The Instagram post’s claims come from a CDC report which states that six per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were not associated with comorbidities. The CDC’s weekly updates break down COVID-19 fatalities across the US and one of the tables (table 3) lists comorbidities, which the US agency explains “shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”.A CDC report on guidance for certifying COVID-19 deaths explains that cause of death is “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death”. In the US death certificates require the immediate cause of death to be listed first with underlying causes stated underneath.Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong, said the post misrepresents the CDC data.“The table that everyone is referring to with the six per cent figure, actually shows that many if not most of the COVID-19 patients who died in the US had at least one issue other than COVID-19,” told AAP FactCheck via email.“However, many of the things in the table – like ARDS or respiratory failure – are caused by COVID-19 itself. It is factually incorrect to say that only six per cent of US COVID-19 deaths were caused by COVID-19.”Mr Meyerowitz-Katz has written about the post’s claims and concluded they were misleading and wrong.“If only six per cent of people who died of COVID-19 actually died from the infection, with the others dying from other things while they had coronavirus, it would reduce the death toll of the dread disease substantially. Sadly, this is complete and utter nonsense,” he wrote in a blog post on August 31.The US National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) told AAP FactCheck via email the post’s claims were incorrect.“The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,” the NCHS said in a statement.“In 94 per cent of deaths with COVID-19, other conditions are listed in addition to COVID-19. These causes may include chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension. They may also include acute conditions that occurred as a result of COVID-19, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.”Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also explained the CDC data in an interview on ABC Television’s Good Morning America (video mark 1mins 18sec).“The point the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of (deaths) had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID, didn’t die of COVID-19. They did.“So the numbers you’ve been hearing – the 180,000-plus deaths – are real deaths from COVID-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that. It’s not 9000 deaths from COVID-19.”Social media claims about the CDC data have been debunked here, here, here and here. The CDC releases weekly updates, breaking down COVID-19 fatalities across the US.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CEkz0ZrAt_5/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://perma.cc/A5XY-GXA2?type=image,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/30/politics/twitter-coronavirus-deaths-false-claim-qanon-trump/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/comorbidities.htm?_ga=2.134983857.193382579.1599546487-204804053.1596095459,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/DEATH11-03final-acc.pdf,https://www.uow.edu.au/the-arts-social-sciences-humanities/research/powerlab/people/,https://www.science.org.au/covid19/experts/gideon-meyerowitz-katz,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome,https://medium.com/@gidmk/covid-19-deaths-are-mostly-caused-by-coronavirus-2a6d2d43bd09,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/mission.htm,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/video/dr-fauci-weighs-6m-us-coronavirus-cases-deaths-72744993,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/cdc-did-not-admit-only-6-of-recorded-deaths-from-covid-19/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/false-claim-shared-by-president-trump-that-only-6-of-cdc-reported-deaths-are-from-covid-19-is-based-on-flawed-reasoning/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/01/fact-check-cdcs-data-covid-19-deaths-used-misleading-claims/5681686002/,https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-comorbidities.html","Claims on CDC data for COVID-19 incorrect, say experts",,,,,,

Yesterday 5 million from all over Europe gathering for the Unite for Freedom Rally. They are expected to stay upto (sic) 5 days or more as they demand for the government to resign.”The August 31 post has generated more than 440 shares and around 18,000 views. A Facebook post claims five million people from across Europe gathered in Berlin for a rally. The AnalysisThe post’s claim of five million attending the Unite for Freedom rally in Berlin features an aerial crowd photo of the German capital, however the image is not from the August 29 protest but a music festival in 1997. The estimated crowd figures for the Berlin rally were also much smaller than the post’s claim.There were several protests against COVID-19 restrictions held across European cities on August 29 including Berlin as well as the Unite for Freedom rally in London. News reports estimate between 18,000 to 38,000 people took to the streets in Berlin where the demonstration turned violent when protesters tried to storm the German parliament, the Reichstag.Using a reverse image AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post’s photo was taken on July 12, 1997 at the Berlin Love Parade by photographer Robert Grahn. Grahn, who owns the aerial imagery agency Euroluftbild, captured the image above Ernst-Reuter-Platz in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin.The Love Parade techno music festival was founded in 1989 by DJ Matthias Roeingh, aka Dr Motte, as a way of spreading peace and joy. In 1997, crowd estimates for the festival were between 750,000 to 1.5 million people.It’s not the first time photos from separate events have been used on social media to mislead on  the size of protests. AAP FactCheck previously debunked a similar claim where a photo from a 2019 music festival in Zurich was used for a Berlin march against measures to stop COVID-19. A photo from a music festival in Berlin was used to emphasise numbers at a protest against COVID-19 measures.","http://archive.today/XtZ3x,http://archive.vn/252ml,https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/29/anti-lockdown-protesters-calling-coronavirus-hoax-gather-london-13195529/,https://archive.is/EAis9,http://archive.vn/252ml,http://archive.vn/Qk3QO,http://archive.today/AmC47,http://archive.today/zqHsN,https://www.dw.com/en/1989-how-reunified-berlin-birthed-a-club-culture-revolution/a-51017498,https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/dr.motte,https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Love-Parade-1688407,https://www.aap.com.au/photo-of-huge-crowd-isnt-from-german-anti-mask-parade-its-from-a-famous-swiss-dance-music-party/",Berlin ‘COVID-19 protest rally’ photo is from a dance music festival in 1997,,,,,,

So that’s why there needs to be at least two tests (in managed isolation).” Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 2, 2020.The AnalysisCOVID-19 may remain undiagnosed in people leaving managed isolation after entering New Zealand because tests have a 30 per cent false negative rate and some returnees are only screened once, NZ National says.The government has been heavily criticised for the testing regime at the border after it was revealed nearly two thirds of border staff and quarantine workers hadn’t been tested for COVID-19.The government later revealed not all of those in managed isolation were being tested on day three of quarantine and the National Party called for day-three testing to be mandatory.Returnees are currently asked to take a COVID-19 test on both day three and day 12 following their entry into the country and are not allowed to leave managed isolation without providing a negative day 12 test.When quizzed about managed isolation testing during a Morning Report interview on September 2, National leader Judith Collins said 30 per cent of tests returned a false negative. (Audio mark 6min 14sec)Her office said the statistic came directly from Health Minister Chris Hipkins, in response to a written question from National health spokesman Shane Reti on June 22.In that response, Mr Hipkins said: “I am advised that there is an estimated 30 per cent false negative rate for PCR testing. I ask the Member to note that this data is not specific to New Zealand, and will vary at the individual patient/person level based on their stage of disease.”AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins’ statement that 30 per cent of COVID-19 tests  returned a false negative, in the context of New Zealand’s managed isolation testing.The Ministry of Health website says New Zealand primarily uses a viral test known as a polymerase chain reaction test, or PCR test, to detect COVID-19. The test can detect very small amounts of COVID-19 in samples, generally taken from a swab of a person’s nose or throat.In addition to Mr Hipkins’ response, Ms Collins’ office also referred AAP FactCheck to a blog from Harvard Medical School, stating the PCR test had a reported false negative rate of between two and 37 per cent, and a report published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), which found the tests had a false negative rate of between two and 29 per cent.Both articles are based on a non-peer reviewed report which collated 34 studies on the false negative rate of the PCR COVID-19 test.The report found a false negative rate of between two per cent and 54 per cent, and noted “the certainty of the evidence was judged as very low, due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues” (page 3).Sample sizes for the studies analysed ranged from 18 people to 5,700 (page 11), only 10 studies recorded how many days had lapsed between the onset of symptoms and testing (page 12), and none of the studies had a reported aim of establishing the false negative rate of the PCR test (page 23).Dr Joshua Freeman, clinical director of microbiology and virology for the Canterbury District Health Board (DHB) and their adviser on the COVID-19 testing regime, said it’s misleading to say 30 per cent of COVID-19 tests give a false negative result.Dr Freeman said the studies which found a high false negative rate in the report cited by Ms Collins had limited applicability to the New Zealand context of testing people in managed isolation.He said this was because those studies were conducted almost exclusively on hospitalised patients with pneumonia who would have likely contracted the virus a week or more earlier, and therefore had a lower viral load in the back of the nose and throat.“Notably, 24 of the studies included in the analysis were conducted early in the epidemic in China when testing was almost exclusively focused on people with symptoms and delays between symptom onset and swabbing were common,” Dr Freeman told AAP FactCheck.The report’s authors also note that the results from China were probably affected by several unreported issues, including that the tests used were among the first developed, there was no standardised testing method and there was limited knowledge about the virus at the beginning of 2020 (page 24).Dr Freeman said that testing asymptomatic people in managed isolation is a very different scenario from testing hospitalised patients with pneumonia.“Infectious people undergoing asymptomatic day three screening in managed isolation facilities are likely to be in the pre-symptomatic phase of infection.“During the pre-symptomatic phase of infection, viral shedding from the nasopharynx is almost certainly very high and so there is a lot of virus present for the test to detect.“In this setting, providing the swab is collected appropriately, the false negative rate is likely to be very low.“Although it’s not possible to estimate false negative rates in this setting with any precision it’s almost certainly substantially lower than the 30 per cent quoted.“If our tests missed 30 per cent of all actively infectious cases, this would have enormous implications for control. It’s implausible that New Zealand and other countries could have achieved the levels of control they have with a false negative rate this high.”University of Otago public health professor Nick Wilson said a review of research on the PCR test sensitivity, published in the Radiological Society of North America’s journal in April, found the tests had an average false negative rate of about 11 per cent.But he emphasised test timing is important when determining accuracy.“But taken overall, the scientific answer is a false negative rate of around 11 per cent with (the report indicating) a range of six per cent to 19 per cent based on this meta-analysis.”According to the Ministry of Health, a laboratory study found the tests correctly detected COVID-19 in samples more than 95 per cent of the time, implying the tests gave a false negative result five per cent of the time.AAP FactCheck contacted the Ministry of Health asking it to explain the discrepancy between the figures on its website and Mr Hipkins’ statement putting the false negative rate at 30 per cent.The Ministry of Health did not specifically address the discrepancy, but it said a 30 per cent false negative rate did not mean 30 per cent of all tests gave a false negative result. Instead, it meant that if you tested 100 people with COVID-19, 30 would return a false negative result. COVID-19 test figures in New Zealand’s managed isolation facilities are under scrutiny in the election campaign.","https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/nearly-two-thirds-of-nz-s-covid-19-border-isolation-staff-had-never-been-tested-a-week-ago.html,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122566895/coronavirus-national-points-to-another-risk-at-the-border-unknown-number-of-returnees-are-not-tested-twice,https://covid19.govt.nz/travel-and-the-border/border-restrictions/managed-isolation-and-quarantine/,https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018762191/judith-collins-surprised-james-shaw-didn-t-resign-over-green-school-funding,https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/WQ_11505_2020/11505-2020-dr-shane-reti-to-the-health-minister-chris,http://health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-general-public/assessment-and-testing-covid-19/how-covid-19-testing-works,https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734,https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/history-of-the-bmj,https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/369/bmj.m1808.full.pdf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20066787v2.full.pdf,https://www.chl.co.nz/home/leadership-team,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120924215/coronavirus-between-testing-lab-and-hospital-doctor-goes-where-i-can-make-the-most-difference,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20066787v2.full.pdf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20066787v2.full.pdf,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024455.html,https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020201343,https://www.rsna.org/en/about,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-general-public/assessment-and-testing-covid-19/covid-19-test-results-and-their-accuracy#:~:text=body%20was%20low.-,The%20accuracy%20of%20test%20results,100%25)%20of%20the%20time.",Just how effective are COVID-19 tests conducted in NZ’s managed isolation?,,,,,,

It lists under “Grounds for International Complaint alleged charges of “war crimes with intent to commit mass genocide”. The hearing is listed for “1:00 P.M.

(Friday, June 5, 2020)”.The post’s caption also claims, “Here is something never seen before until now!”. An Instagram post claims Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci among others faced “war crimes” charges. The AnalysisThe post’s purported document falsely claims that Bill Gates, Dr Anthony Fauci, the World Health Organization and CDC, among others, have faced a human rights tribunal for war crimes. There is no evidence “The Human Rights Tribunal International” exists.The document features the letterhead, “The Human Rights Tribunal International”, however there is no such tribunal in the US. A list of United Nations bodies involved in human rights promotion and protection also shows no listing for the purported tribunal.War crimes are heard in the International Criminal Court, however, the United States is not a member of the court.The hearing date on the document is for the “79th Day in the Year of Yahweh 6022” and, in brackets, Friday, June 5,  2020. An online search showed no reports of a hearing on that date against the people and organisations named in the post.At the bottom of the document are links to two websites, the first link redirects to Reign of the Heavens.

138,,,,False,,2020-09-02,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/nz-military-powers-under-covid-19-are-not-equivalent-to-police/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Have soldiers been given the same powers of a police constable?The Statement“So now, it was announced the other day that military staff now have extra powers similar to that of a constable while managing a detention centre.”Billy Te Kahika Jr, NZ Public Party, August 29, 2020.The AnalysisAs military personnel play an increasing role in New Zealand’s COVID-19 managed isolation and quarantine facilities, concerns are being raised that the Defence Force are being granted extra powers.Around 1200 Defence Force personnel are now involved in the country’s COVID-19 response, including about 990 stationed at managed isolation facilities. This has been criticised by Advance NZ co-leader Billy Te Kahika Jr, who has earlier made inaccurate statements that the Defence Force had been granted the power to enter private residences without a warrant.During an interview on Newshub Nation on Three on August 29, Mr Te Kahika said the power of the military had been expanded and “we’ve got people’s rights and freedoms being eroded”. (Video mark 8min 32secs).“So now, it was announced the other day that military staff now have extra powers similar to that of a constable while managing a detention centre,” Mr Te Kahika said. (Video mark 8min 55secs)AAP FactCheck examined Mr Te Kahika’s statement that military staff have been granted powers similar to a police constable.New Zealand’s quarantine and managed isolation facilities have been partially staffed by the Defence Force since at least June 19, when numbers were doubled to 72. This was done after the government was criticised for allowing two people to leave managed isolation early, without being tested for COVID-19.The role of the Defence Force has expanded significantly since, with Defence Force personnel increasingly taking over from private security guards in high risk facilities.Members of the Armed Forces have also been stationed at vehicle checkpoints since August 12, supporting police at roadblocks in Auckland during the recent Level 3 lockdown.Until recently Defence Force personnel reportedly had no more powers than a security. However, their powers were expanded on August 25, when Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield authorised members of the Armed Forces to have the power to “give direction” and “to direct persons to provide identifying information”.These powers were granted by Dr Bloomfield under COVID-19 Public Health and Response Act 2020, which was passed on May 23 to enable the government to enforce measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Under Section 18 of the Act, the Director-General can authorise employees of the Crown to be an “enforcement officer” and grant them a range of powers, including to enter a property without a warrant.However, on August 25, Dr Bloomfield only extended powers under Section 21 and Section 23 of the Act to members of the Armed Forces. This gives them the power to instruct a person not to break an order under the Act and the power to direct a person to provide identifying information, including their full name, full address, date of birth, occupation, and telephone number.Not following these directions becomes an offence under the Act. These powers had earlier been granted to WorkSafe inspectors, Aviation Security officers and Customs officers.So how does this compare with the powers of a police constable?University of Otago law professor Andrew Geddis has written extensively on NZ’s lockdown laws and told AAP FactCheck via email, that the powers granted to the Defence Force fall well short of those of a constable.He said the key difference is that a constable has the power to arrest and detain people.“Failing to comply with an enforcement officer’s directions/requirement is an offence under the legislation – people ‘have’ to do what they say, or else risk prosecution,” Prof Geddis said.“But, and this is a pretty key difference, the military have no power to directly force people to comply with their directions/requirements.“They have no legal power to arrest or detain, no right to physically restrain, etc. Only constables may do so (under their general policing powers).”Prof Geddis explained that while a member of the military can stand at the entrance of a managed isolation facility and ask people to identify themselves, they can’t enforce these directions.“If a person ignores them, they can’t grab them and hold them. Instead, they have to call in the police to effect an arrest,” he told AAP FactCheck.“As the defining feature of the police is the power to arrest and detain, saying that members of the military now have “similar” powers is false.” A Kiwi politician claims military staff have been granted powers similar to a police constable.","https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/boosting-security-support-managed-isolation-facilities-and-maritime-border,https://factcheck.afp.com/misleading-claim-spreads-online-new-zealand-has-authorised-troops-enter-homes-enforce-covid-19,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/advance-nz-co-leader-billy-te-kahika-jr-lies-about-5g-claims-denies-he-s-a-conspiracy-theorist.html,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/next-steps-managed-isolation-and-quarantine-facilities,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/121855818/coronavirus-border-bungle-an-unacceptable-failure--prime-minister-jacinda-ardern,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/boosting-security-support-managed-isolation-facilities-and-maritime-border,https://www.nzdf.mil.nz/nzdf/covid-19-response/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300087239/coronavirus-troops-have-no-more-powers-than-miq-security-guards-they-replace,https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/nzdf_authorisation.pdf,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0012/latest/whole.html#whole,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0012/latest/whole.html#LMS344191,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0012/latest/whole.html#LMS344194,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0012/latest/whole.html#LMS344195,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0012/latest/whole.html#LMS344197,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-epidemic-notice-and-orders#authorisations,https://www.otago.ac.nz/law/staff/andrew_geddis.html",NZ military powers under COVID-19 are not equivalent to police,,,,,,
139,,,,False,,2020-08-31,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/vaccine-being-developed-for-covid-19-wont-alter-a-persons-dna/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims “a new vaccine for COVID-19” will alter a person’s DNA and result in them becoming “genetically modified”.The post’s image is of a diagram comparing RNA and DNA with text which reads, “The new vaccine for Covid-19 will be the first of its kind EVER. It will be an mRNA vaccine which will literally alter your DNA. It will wrap itself into your system. You will essentially become a genetically modified human being.”The August 21 post has attracted more than 360 shares and has been viewed more than 32,000 times. A Facebook post claims that “a new vaccine for COVID-19” will alter a person’s DNA. The AnalysisIt’s true that mRNA vaccines are among many being tested around the world by companies such as Moderna in the US and institutions like Oxford University and Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. However, the post’s primary claims that mRNA vaccines will alter a person’s DNA and genetically modify humans are false, experts told AAP FactCheck.In addition, the post’s RNA and DNA diagram has been previously published to illustrate their differences and is unrelated to vaccines.RNA (Ribonucleic acid) vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence into the body which instructs cells to produce disease-specific antigens, according to a University of Cambridge briefing. An article in The Lancet from July 2020 details how a potential COVID-19 RNA vaccine would instruct cells to produce proteins with specific spikes that are found on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The article says it’s “hoped these proteins will trigger an immune response that would then be able to kill the virus”.Should an mRNA vaccine be approved for human use against COVID-19 it would be the first of its kind, according to Professor Isabelle Bekeredjian-Ding, head of the microbiology division of Germany’s Paul Ehrlich Institut.Regarding the post’s claims, Dr Gaetan Burgio, a geneticist and infections researcher at the Australian National University in Camberra, told AAP FactCheck that mRNA sequences have a short lifespan in the body and are converted into disease-specific proteins for the immune system to target.“MRNA encodes a piece of the virus but does not integrate into the human DNA, therefore it does not alter DNA whatsoever,” he said.Dr Burgio said an mRNA vaccine won’t result in people becoming “genetically modified” as the MRNA sequence doesn’t integrate into the genome, an organism’s complete set of DNA.Dr Kylie Quinn, an immunologist from RMIT University in Victoria, told AAP FactCheck: “MRNA vaccines are basically delivering instructions to the cells in our body to make that protein for us so we don’t have to make it in a vaccine production facility ourselves.”Dr Quinn said genetic modification is an alteration to DNA which is not what a mRNA vaccine does.“RNA is just expressed by the cell for a short period of time and then the cell degrades it, so it doesn’t become a permanent feature of the cell and doesn’t integrate into DNA, so it’s not genetic modification.”Professor Dale Godfrey, head of immunology from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, agreed that mRNA vaccines do not incorporate into a person’s DNA.“They work in a different part of the cell (cytoplasm rather than nucleus) and mRNA is eventually cleared,” he told AAP FactCheck. Claims that mRNA vaccines alter a person’s DNA have been previously debunked here, here and here. An mRNA vaccine won’t result in people becoming genetically modified, a geneticist told AAP FactCheck.","https://archive.is/FYHNJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04470427,https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Area/coronavirus-research/vaccine,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins,https://netnature.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/dna-ou-rna-eis-a-questao-por-que-o-dna-e-nao-o-rna-e-a-molecula-que-armazena-a-informacao-genetica/,https://www.umassmed.edu/rti/biology/what-is-rna/,https://www.britannica.com/science/antigen,https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines,https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanmic/PIIS2666-5247(20)30070-7.pdf,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/five-things-you-need-know-about-mrna-vaccines.html,https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/About-IMI/Governance/sc/SC_Bio_Bekeredjian_Ding_0.pdf,https://www.pei.de/EN/research/groups/microbiology/microbiology-research-node.html,https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/dr-ga%C3%A9tan-burgio#acton-tabs-link--tabs-person_tabs-middle-1,https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/hgp/genome,https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/q/quinn-dr-kylie,https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-dale-godfrey,https://mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/engage/partners/research-institutes/doherty-institute,https://www.britannica.com/science/cytoplasm,https://fullfact.org/health/mrna-covid-vaccine/,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/07/22/verificamos-vacinas-covid-altera-dna/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-covid-19-vaccine-modify/false-claim-a-covid-19-vaccine-will-genetically-modify-humans-idUSKBN22U2BZ",Vaccine being developed for COVID-19 won’t alter a person’s DNA,,,,,,
140,,,,The Verdict,,2020-08-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/lower-voting-age-higher-participation-rate-claims-make-it-16/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Did a greater proportion of 16 year olds vote in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria than 18 and 20 year olds?The Statement“We’ve seen that with other countries like Scotland and Wales and Austria, where they actually have a greater turnout of 16 year olds voting, instead of, more than 18 and 20 year olds.”Make It 16 representative Sophie Crozier, August 24, 2020.The AnalysisA group advocating for New Zealand’s voting age to be lowered to 16 claims the move could boost voter turnout among young people.The group Make It 16 has taken its case to the NZ High Court, claiming the current voting age of 18 is discriminatory and inconsistent with the Bill of Rights.When Make It 16 representative Sophie Crozier appeared on The Project on Three on August 24, she said changing the voting age would have a positive impact on youth voter turnout. (Video mark 22min 57secs).“And we’ve seen that with other countries like Scotland and Wales and Austria, where they actually have a greater turnout of 16-year-olds voting, instead of, more than 18- and 20-year-olds and I think that’s because you’re in your own safety bubble,” Ms Crozier said.AAP FactCheck examined Ms Crozier’s statement that voter turnout was higher among 16-year-olds compared with 18- and 20-year-olds in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria.In 2007, Austria became the first country in the European Union to lower the voting age to 16 for all national elections. In the 2020 book, Lowering the Voting Age to 16: Learning from Real Experiences Worldwide, University of Vienna researcher Julian Aichholzer reviews the research on the policy change in a chapter titled Voting at 16 in Practice: A Review of the Austrian Case.In total, three studies found turnout for 16- and 17-year-olds was generally higher than that for 18- to 20-year-olds in Austrian elections (page 4).One of those studies, titled Are People More Inclined to Vote at 16 than at 18? Evidence for the First-Time Voting Boost Among 16- to 25-Year-Olds in Austria, looked at two regional elections in Austria and found turnout was higher among 16-year-olds than 18-year-olds in Vienna. However, in the region of Krems, turnout among 16-year-olds was slightly lower than that for 18-year-olds (Figure 1 and figure 2, page 357).In both regions, 16-year-olds had a significantly higher turnout than 20-year-olds and the 16-17 age bracket had a higher turnout than the 18-20 age bracket (Table 2, page 358).In both cases, 16-year-olds also had a slightly lower turnout than the electorate as a whole (Figure 1 and figure 2, page 357).Aichholzer’s report also included novel research, analysing data from five elections between 2005 and 2015 (page 6). It found 16-year-olds were estimated to have a higher turnout than 18-year-olds in all but one election, and higher than 20-year-olds in all elections. (Figure 1, page 8).The report concluded the level of turnout was “generally higher among 16- to 17-year-olds (compared to 18- to 20-year-olds) and similar to the electorate’s average (and here in particular amongst the 16-year-olds), as evidenced by official records from electoral lists.” (page 16)The UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group on Votes at 16, which was set up to investigate lowering the voting age, published a report in 2019 which found turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds in Austria has stabilised at around 8-10 percentage points higher than 18- to 24-year-olds (page 15). Scotland first lowered the voting age to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, and in 2015 it lowered the voting age for the Scottish parliamentary elections and local government elections.A UK Electoral Commission report on the referendum found the turnout of 16- and 17-year-olds was significantly higher than for 18-24 year olds. In total, 75 per cent of 16- and 17-year-olds claimed to have voted, compared with 54 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 years (page 64). This was based on a post-election survey of 1852 eligible voters and not the poll result itself (page 150).In total, 109,593 16- and 17-year-olds registered (page 1), which is an estimated 90 per cent of those eligible to vote based on figures from the National Records of Scotland, which show there were 121,657 16- and 17-year-olds in 2014.The Electoral Commission reports on the 2016 Scottish parliamentary elections and the 2017 local government elections did not include a breakdown of voter turnout in the 16-17 age group.However, raw data from a 2017 survey produced for the commission after the local government elections shows 51 per cent of 16- and 17- year-olds claim to have voted, compared with 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 (page 12).AAP FactCheck was unable to find figures for voter turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds in these elections.In Wales, 16-year-olds have not yet had the opportunity to vote. In November 2019, the Senedd Cymru/Welsh parliament voted to lower the voting age to 16 for the 2021 Senedd elections. Research in Austria and Scotland found more 16 and 17 year olds voted compared with 18-24 year olds. The VerdictAAP FactCheck found the statement that voter turnout was higher among 16-year-olds compared with 18- and 20-year-olds in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria to be somewhat true.Research in Austria and Scotland found more 16- and 17-year-olds voted compared with 18- to 24-year-olds. However, Wales has only recently lowered the voting age for the Welsh parliamentary elections and 16-year-olds will not get the opportunity to vote until next year.Somewhat True – A part or parts of the claim are accurate but there is also a significant problem or inaccuracy.* AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/","https://makeit16.org.nz/media/,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/122529313/campaign-for-voting-at-16-and-17-claims-age-discrimination,https://www.threenow.co.nz/shows/the-project/season-2020%253A-monday-24-august-2020/S1173-784/M39938-485,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/world/europe/06fbriefs-austria.html,https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030325404,https://staatswissenschaft.univie.ac.at/en/team/scientific-staff/julian-aichholzer/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337605757_Voting_at_16_in_Practice_A_Review_of_the_Austrian_Case,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17457289.2013.872652?needAccess=true,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337605757_Voting_at_16_in_Practice_A_Review_of_the_Austrian_Case,https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Estimated-turnout-of-16-to-21-year-olds-by-election_fig1_337605757,https://www.byc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Votes-at-16-APPG-Campaign-Report-2019.pdf,https://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/60464.aspx,https://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/88272.aspx,https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf_file/Scottish-independence-referendum-report.pdf,https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-19/mid-year-pop-est-19-time-series-1.xlsx,https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/mid-year-population-estimates/population-estimates-time-series-data,https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/scottish-parliamentary-elections/report-how-2016-scottish-parliament-election-was-run,https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/scotland-local-council-elections/report-how-2017-scottish-local-elections-were-run,https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf_file/Scottish-Local-Council-elections-May-2017-Public-opinion-survey-Crosstabs.pdf,https://senedd.wales/en/abthome/role-of-assembly-how-it-works/Pages/Voting-Age.aspx,https://aap.com.au/","Lower voting age, higher participation rate, claims Make It 16",,,,,,

The text over the images reads, “Zap. Obey. Shot of radiation to the pineal gland !”The August 16 Facebook post by a New Zealand user has been shared more than 70 times and generated more than 90 reactions. The Instagram post has been liked by more than 240 users. A Facebook post claims that infrared thermometer guns can damage the pineal gland. The AnalysisThe Facebook post inaccurately claims scanning a person’s forehead using an infrared thermometer poses a risk to the pineal gland. Infrared thermometers do not emit an infrared ray towards the pineal gland, instead they detect emitted radiation, according to two experts contacted by AAP FactCheck and advice from Johns Hopkins University in the US.The post’s video features a man reading a copied post in which “an Australian nurse” says she had a sudden realisation: “Are we being desensitised to be targeted at the head and also causing potential health issues by aiming an infrared ray to the pineal gland?”The “Australian nurse” goes on to say (1min 25sec) that when it was her turn to be checked she, “took the gun that was being directed at my forehead and redirected it to my wrist. I… told the employee that an infrared thermometer must never be pointed at someone’s forehead, especially babies and young children”.“As a medical professional, I refuse to directly target the pineal gland which is located directly in the centre of the forehead, with an infrared ray… Our pineal glands must be protected as it is crucial for our health both now and in the future,” she says in the post (video mark 2min 12sec).Regarding the post’s claims, Professor Greg Anderson from the Centre for Neuroendocrinology at New Zealand’s University of Otago told AAP FactCheck in an email that infrared thermometers do not target the pineal gland, nor do they pose a risk to it.“The non-contact infrared thermometer doesn’t emit so the pineal gland is unaffected,” said the professor, a research scientist and lecturer with expertise in neuroscience.Prof Anderson explained the pineal gland is “embedded centrally in the skull, between the two hemispheres of the brain”.“It’s functions all boil down to regulating sleep/wake cycles, because it secretes the hormone melatonin only during the hours of darkness which sends a light/dark signal to many different organs in the body to regulate their activity levels.”Regarding the claim “an infrared thermometer must never be pointed at someone’s forehead, especially babies and young children”, Prof Anderson told AAP FactCheck: “Not correct. The forehead is a convenient location to take these measurements, and since it is totally passive (just as is holding a mercury thermometer near someone’s head), the age of the person makes no difference.”Prof Anderson also rejected the claim that infrared thermometers emit radiation, saying they detect the body’s emitted radiation.Peter Saunders, a radiation thermometry research scientist at the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand, agreed and told AAP FactCheck via email: “An infrared thermometer… is a passive device that measures infrared radiation that is naturally emitted by all objects. It does not direct or emit any infrared ray at the target.”“As a comparison, it works in a similar way to a camera – collecting and focusing infrared energy emitted by the target onto a detector inside the device. In this respect, an infrared thermometer is no more dangerous than any other everyday room-temperature item you would find in your surroundings,” he said.Dr Haris Sair, director of neuroradiology at Johns Hopkins University previously said the claims that infrared thermometers target the pineal gland and emit radiation were both false.“This thing is smack dab right in the middle of the head,” Dr Sair said. “Nothing is happening between the thermometer and the pineal gland.”Similar posts regarding infrared thermometers have been debunked here, here, here, here, here and here. Infrared thermometers don’t emit radiation nor target the pineal gland, two experts told AAP FactCheck.","http://archive.is/JTF9m,http://archive.is/IsD7a,https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/general-hospital-devices-and-supplies/non-contact-infrared-thermometers,https://www.otago.ac.nz/neuroendocrinology/staff/otago660123.htm,https://www.otago.ac.nz/neuroendocrinology/about/index.html#:~:text=About%20the%20Centre%20for%20Neuroendocrinology&text=Formed%20in%202003%2C%20the%20Centre,of%20Otago%20flagship%20research%20centre.,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/NPCR/pdf/abstracting/cns.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/NPCR/pdf/abstracting/cns.pdf,https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Melatonin%20is%20a%20hormone%20that,night%20can%20block%20melatonin%20production.,https://measurement.govt.nz/about-us/our-people/page-27/,https://measurement.govt.nz/,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/6606051/haris-sair,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:9121703294,https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/infrared-thermometer-22899,http://www.world-today-news.com/do-infrared-thermometers-damage-the-pineal-gland-experts-respond-2/,https://fullfact.org/health/infrared-thermometers-do-not-affect-pineal-gland/,https://newsmeter.in/fact-check-claim-that-infrared-thermometer-guns-can-damage-pineal-gland-is-false/,https://factcheck.afp.com/thermometer-guns-are-safe-use-health-experts-say,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/08/11/fact-check-infrared-thermometers-radiation-pineal-gland/",Infrared thermometers do not pose a risk to the pineal gland,,,,,,

The Statement“The American people can work out that we have [the same number of COVID-19 cases] for a whole day what they have every 22 seconds of a day.”New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, August 18, 2020.The AnalysisWhen US President Donald Trump called into question New Zealand’s record on managing COVID-19, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters pointed out the vast disparity in the number of cases in the two countries.Speaking on the tarmac of an airport in Minnesota on August 17, Mr Trump told a crowd there had been a “big surge” of cases in New Zealand.“In fact even New Zealand, you see what’s going on in New Zealand? They beat it, they beat it. It was like front page, ‘they beat it’, because they wanted to show me something,” Mr Trump said.“The problem is, big surge in New Zealand. So, you know, it’s terrible. We don’t want that,” Trump said (video mark 29min 31sec).The comments drew scorn from New Zealand politicians.Speaking to RNZ, Mr Peters tried to put the outbreak in New Zealand in perspective. (video mark 1min)“The American people can work out that we have [the same number of COVID-19 cases] for a whole day what they have every 22 seconds of a day,” Mr Peters said. “That speaks for itself.”The video of Mr Peters’ statement has been viewed over 34,000 times on YouTube and his comments were reported around the world, including in Forbes and Huffington Post.But is the claim correct?The World Health Organization (WHO) Situation by Country tables, the US recorded 54,375 on August 17, the most recent date for which figures were available when Mr Peters made his claim, on the afternoon of August 18.This equates to the equivalent of 0.629 cases a second, or 13.8 cases in 22 seconds.Figures from the US government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show two different figures for the number of cases recorded in the country on August 17. The graph of New Cases by Day states there were 38,986 new cases recorded, whereas the data in the table below the graph puts that figure at 39,318 cases for the same date.Regardless of which statistic is used, it equates to about 10 cases in 22 seconds –  9.92 cases in 22 seconds for the first statistic, and 10.01 for the latterBy contrast, according to the Ministry of Health and WHO, on August 17 New Zealand recorded nine new cases.However, Mr Peters made his statement after updated figures for New Zealand were released at 1pm on August 18, showing the country as having 13 cases in the 24 hours to 9am that day.Based on the most up-to-date figures available to Mr Peters at the time of his statement, New Zealand had recorded 13 cases in 24 hours, whereas the US had recorded the equivalent of between 10 and 13.8 cases in 22 seconds on that same day.Using the seven-day average of New Cases By Day statistics calculated by the CDC, on August 17 the US had an average of 48,674 cases, or the equivalent of 12.4 cases in 22 seconds.In the seven days up to and including August 17 in NZ, which happens to cover the entirety of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the country recorded 61 cases, or an average of 8.7 cases a day. NZ politicians have rejected US President Donald Trump’s remarks about their management of COVID-19.","https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/about-us/our-people/our-ministers/winston-peters/,https://youtu.be/2-Q3W2sbEOw?t=1754,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/423780/donald-trump-refers-to-big-surge-of-covid-19-in-new-zealand?fbclid=IwAR3tPUSDI0GhinrP0QCZS-o2t8DZGaH_uhoDr9CSPO94_zU6kl9XkRrPytQ,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/08/18/new-zealands-jacinda-ardern-slams-trump-for-patently-wrong-comments-about-their-new-coronavirus-outbreak/#399e355e2ccd,https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/jacinda-ardern-trump-coronavirus-new-zealand_au_5f3c9bf1c5b6835236038481,https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/us,https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/cio.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html,https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/9-new-cases-covid-19-2,https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/nz,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html,https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/nz",NZ rejects US President’s COVID-19 comparisons,,,,,,

One decriminalised, one legalised, they both had massive education programs and both invested heavily in addiction treatment.”Andrew Little, Labour Party MP, August 11, 2020.The AnalysisAs New Zealanders prepare to vote on whether to legalise cannabis, Labour MP Andrew Little is using the experience of other countries to dampen fears more liberal laws will lead to a spike in adolescent drug usage.A referendum to decide if New Zealand should legalise recreational cannabis will be held alongside the general election on October 17.During an interview on The AM Show on August 11, Labour Party MP Andrew Little said overseas evidence showed youth drug use actually decreased after drug liberalisation. (Video mark 6min 24 secs).“I think if you look at the overseas experience too, the two countries that are probably most advanced, because it’s been in place the longest, are Portugal and Uruguay,” Mr Little said.“They’ve been dealing with this issue for well over 10 years. They saw, as I recall it, in both countries, actually a reduction in harmful drug use by young people as a consequence of what they did.“One decriminalised, one legalised, they both had massive education programmes and both invested heavily in addiction treatment.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Little’s statement that harmful drug use declined among young people in Uruguay and Portugal after drug liberalisation.In 2013, Uruguay made worldwide headlines as the first country in the world to legalise the sale, production and cultivation of recreational cannabis. (Page 1)A recent report by the NZ Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor (PMCSA) on the impacts of cannabis legalisation looked at the research on Uruguay since legalisation.It said “very few studies of the impacts of legalisation in Uruguay have been undertaken, so little is currently known about the public health or social impacts of legal recreational cannabis”.It cites a study titled The Impact of Cannabis Legalisation in Uruguay on Adolescent Cannabis Use, published in the International Journal of Drug Policy in June 2020, which claims to present the first empirical evidence on the impact of legalisation on adolescent cannabis use (Page 1).The report was based on the results of a biennial survey of high school students in Uruguay between 2014 and 2018, as compared to a control group of high school students in Chile, where cannabis is not legal.It found “no evidence that cannabis legalisation impacted rates of adolescent cannabis use or their perceived risk of cannabis use”. However, the study’s authors highlight the fact legal sales of cannabis only began in 2017, saying further research is needed to assess the long-term impacts.The study did not make comment on whether the cannabis use was harmful or otherwise, which Mr Little’s comment centres on, and AAP FactCheck found no research on this topic.In relation to youth drug use in Portugal, Mr Little’s office said his statement was based on the book Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, written by journalist Johann Hari and published in 2015.The book cites figures from Portugal’s Ministry of Health showing the number of problematic drug users halved, from 100,000 to 50,000, following the decriminalisation of drugs in 2001.A separate paper, Portuguese Defiance: Analysing the Strenuous Relationship Between Drug Decriminalization and International Law, cites the same statistics (page 745). The figures were not specific to adolescent users.Another report, titled What Can We Learn from the Portuguse Decriminalization of Illicit Drugs?, published in the British Journal of Criminology in 2010, found a decline in harmful drug use across all users aged 15 to 64 years old (page 9). It also notes drug use in 15- to 16-year-olds increased in the lead-up to, and immediately following, decriminalisation before declining. (Page 9).These figures were based on the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD), which collected comparable data on substance use among 15- to 16-year-olds in 48 European countries since 1995. The surveys are conducted every four years and the most recent survey was 2015.ESPAD results between 1995 and 2015 show youth drug use increased in Portugal between 1995 and 2003 and then levelled off, mirroring trends across Europe.The proportion of all Portuguese students that had tried cannabis, shown in ESPAD table 64, increased between 1995 to 2003, rising from seven per cent to 15 per cent, then fluctuated by a few percentage points in the next few surveys before returning to 15 per cent in 2015.ESPAD Table 64 shows these trends are similar for European countries without liberal drug laws, therefore they can’t be described as the result of drug decriminalisation.Other research found a slight decrease in drug use among young people in Portugal following decriminalisation. A non-peer reviewed report by libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, titled Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies, found the number of 13- to 15-year-olds who had used drugs declined from 14.1 per cent in 2001, to 10.6 per cent in 2006 (page 11).Using figures attributed to the 2007 draft annual report of the Portuguese government’s Institute of Drugs and Drug Addiction, the Cato Institute report says for those aged 16 to 18, usage rates decreased from 27.6 per cent in 2001, to 21.6 per cent in 2006 (pages 11 and 12). The statistics relate to all drugs, not just cannabis. NZ’s cannabis legalisation referendum may be influenced by fears around its impact on young people.","https://www.referendums.govt.nz/cannabis/index.html,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/cannabis-referendum-andrew-little-reveals-his-experience-with-marijuana.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uruguay-marijuana-vote/uruguay-becomes-first-country-to-legalize-marijuana-trade-idUSBRE9BA01520131211,http://www.fundaciondaya.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-impact-of-cannabis-legalization-in-Uruguay-on-adolescent-cannabis-use.pdf,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/cannabis/,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/2020/07/07/uruguay-a-government-controlled-market/,http://www.fundaciondaya.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-impact-of-cannabis-legalization-in-Uruguay-on-adolescent-cannabis-use.pdf,https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/chasing-the-scream-9781408857830/,https://johannhari.com/index.php/biography/,https://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1198&context=ilr,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/29910/1/Hughes%20%20Stevens%202010.pdf,http://www.espad.org/report/summary,http://www.espad.org/report/table-64-lifetime-use-marijuana-or-hashish-gender-1995-2015-percentages,http://www.espad.org/report/table-64-lifetime-use-marijuana-or-hashish-gender-1995-2015-percentages,https://www.cato.org/about,https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/greenwald_whitepaper.pdf",NZ cannabis referendum raises questions about impacts on youth,,,,,,

Supplementing with vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce severity”.The post goes to make the claim, “therapeutic doses require a minimum of 3000-5000IU per day for adults for at least 6 weeks (Diamond et al., 2005), in order to increase your levels and get health benefits.”The August 14 post, on a page for a business called Ross Walter Nutritionist & Naturopath, has attracted more than 170 shares and more than 20,000 views. A Facebook post claims vitamin D supplements can prevent a COVID-19 infection and reduce severity. The AnalysisCan vitamin D supplements prevent a COVID-19 infection and reduce its severity? The Facebook post’s claim is not supported by conclusive medical evidence, nor by experts in pharmacology, physiology and infectious diseases contacted by AAP FactCheck.Vitamin D is produced in some foods, supplements and through ultraviolet light from the sun on the skin. It also promotes calcium absorption in the body which is needed for bone growth and plays a significant role in the human immune system promoting immune cell production.The claim that vitamin D supplementation can treat or prevent COVID-19 infections has been the subject of several studies during the COVID-19 pandemic with differing findings.A review into the effect of vitamin D as a treatment or prevention for COVID-19 by the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found “no clinical evidence that vitamin D supplements are beneficial in preventing or treating COVID-19”.The British Medical Journal (BMJ) released a report in April 2020 summarising evidence of the associations between vitamin D, influenza, upper respiratory tract infections and immune health to provide “a balanced scientific view on vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus/COVID-19 disease”.The report concluded: “We recommend appropriate vitamin D randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation”.Dr Ian Musgrave, a lecturer in pharmacology at the University of Adelaide, told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post was “incredibly misleading” and that there is no evidence that vitamin D is associated with COVID-19 infection.“There’s been a number of suggestive studies, but they have been of very poor quality, and a recent review by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the UK concluded that it was age and health status, not vitamin D levels, that were associated with COVID-19 infections,” he said.Rebecca Mason, a professor of endocrine physiology from the University of Sydney, who told AAP FactCheck in an email that it is not known whether vitamin D can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections.“There are several trials underway at the moment worldwide to test this proposal. The evidence provides some support for doing the trials. Whether this all is supported when the trial results come out remains to be seen,” she said.Dr Gaetan Burgio, a geneticist and infections researcher at the Australian National University, told AAP FactCheck in an email there is no convincing evidence to date that vitamin D would prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce severity.“Over 30 ongoing clinical trials are exploring this possibility and will provide some additional insights on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 within weeks,” he said.Previous studies, including one from the BMJ in 2017, have supported the claim that vitamin D plays a role in protecting people from contracting acute respiratory tract infections.Dr Burgio said though there is evidence that vitamin D supplementation can protect against acute respiratory infection, there isn’t enough to implement a vitamin D administration strategy to a large population.“Dose amounts and intervals to provide a protective effect to a large population are still unknown and there is no evidence that Vitamin D administration, once vitamin D levels are corrected, would provide a protective effect against acute respiratory infections,” he said.The post also claimed therapeutic doses require a minimum of 3000-5000IU per day for adults for at least six weeks in order to increase vitamin D levels and get health benefits.The BMJ report from April 2020 cautioned against a high dosage of vitamin D supplements.“Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 micrograms per day). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiency in the population,” it said.Dr Musgrave told AAP FactCheck there is “no evidence whatsoever” to support the post’s recommendation of taking 3000-5000IU of vitamin D every day for six weeks as a preventative against COVID-19.“Consistently high levels of supplementation have not shown to have that level of benefit, and they have their own risks,” he said.Similar claims about vitamin D supplements as a preventative for COVID-19 have been previously debunked here, here and here. An infections expert told AAP FactCheck there is no convincing evidence that vitamin D can prevent COVID-19.","http://archive.is/uWbk4,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/vitamin-d-a-rapid-review-of-the-evidence-for-treatment-or-prevention-in-covid-19/,https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/3/1/106,https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/ian.musgrave,https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/es28/evidence/evidence-review-pdf-8777674477,https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/rebecca-mason.html,https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/dr-ga%C3%A9tan-burgio#acton-tabs-link--tabs-person_tabs-middle-1,https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583,https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/bmjnph/early/2020/06/09/bmjnph-2020-000089.full.pdf,https://factcheck.afp.com/health-experts-say-there-no-evidence-vitamin-d-effective-preventing-novel-coronavirus-infection,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/06/25/does-vitamin-d-ward-off-coronavirus/,https://theconversation.com/does-vitamin-d-ward-off-coronavirus-dont-reach-for-the-supplements-yet-139063",Vitamin D claim for COVID-19 fails to shine light on evidence,,,,,,

Unfortunately, under Judith Collins we saw a decrease in police and so that to me is the fundamental foundation of any response to increases in gang activity,” Ms Ardern said.AAP FactCheck has examined Ms Ardern’s claim that under Ms Collins there was a decrease in police.Ms Collins, who was police minister under the previous National government between November 2008 and December 2011 and again from December 2015 to December 2016, admitted in August 2016 her government had not kept up with its target of one officer for every 500 people living in New Zealand. (Mark 34sec).At the time, there was about one officer to every 526 people, she said. (Mark 55sec). But, in early November 2017, Ms Collins rejected incoming Labour police minister Stuart Nash’s assertions National had failed to put more police on the beat. (Mark 35sec).In a 2017 interview on the AM Show, Ms Collins said the National government had increased the police force by 600. (Mark 22sec)In an emailed statement, NZ Police provided AAP FactCheck with constabulary numbers for 2008 to 2020, as at June each year.  The figures, which are not routinely published nor publicly available, show officer numbers as distinct from the total number of NZ Police employees. According to NZ Police, in June 2008, there were 8,211 police officers. Ms Collins first became police minister in November 2008.The NZ Police figures show officer numbers then rose to 8,643 in June 2009 and 8,707 in June 2010, before dropping to 8,638 in June 2011. Ms Collins’ portfolios changed in December 2011, but she returned to the role of police minister in December 2015. There were 8,923 police officers in June 2015 and this dropped to 8,899 in June 2016. Ms Collins portfolios changed again in December 2016. While there were some year-on-year decreases in the number of police officers during Ms Collins’ stints as police minister, officer numbers increased overall by 688.However, when measured as a ratio of the population of New Zealand, police numbers decreased. According to a table of Census data showing the past 29 years, there were an estimated 4,259,800 people resident in NZ in June 2008. The population rose to 4,302,600 in June 2009; 4,350,700 in June 2010; 4,384,000 in June 2011; 4,585,600 in June 2015; and 4,678,100 in June 2016.AAP FactCheck calculated police numbers as a ratio of the resident population for the years in which Judith Collins was police minister by dividing the population figures by the constabulary numbers for the corresponding year.This revealed there was one police officer for every 519 NZ residents in June 2008, one for every 498 residents in June 2009, 1/500 in 2010, 1/507 in 2011, 1/514 in 2015 and 1/526 in 2016. NZ PM Jacinda Ardern says National leader Judith Collins oversaw a drop in police numbers.","https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/nationalparty/pages/14589/attachments/original/1597199017/Nationals_Law_and_Order_Policy_Package.pdf?1597199017,https://www.rnz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018758974,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/collins-judith/,https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/mike-hosking-breakfast/audio/collins-increase-in-police-numbers-needed-to-help-tackle-family-violence/,https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/mike-hosking-breakfast/audio/collins-increase-in-police-numbers-needed-to-help-tackle-family-violence/,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/10/police-minister-stuart-nash-promises-boost-in-numbers.html,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/11/police-number-claims-complete-rubbish-collins.html,https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/population",NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says police numbers declined under National’s leader,,,,,,

However, it falsely claims that hydroxychloroquine is the same as quinine.Hydroxychloroquine is a drug that is used to prevent malaria and treat conditions such as arthritis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was first synthesised in 1950 as a less toxic alternative to chloroquine, according to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy.Quinine is a compound which comes from the bark of the Cinchona tree. It is also an antimalarial which is used to treat cramps.University of Sydney pharmaceutical expert Dr Nial Wheate told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post’s claim that quinine is hydroxychloroquine “without fillers and preservatives” is incorrect.Alan Armstrong, Professor of Organic Synthesis at Imperial College London previously rejected the claim, saying: “Hydroxychloroquine is a completely different chemical substance to quinine.”Prof Armstrong told Reuters: “Historically, hydroxychloroquine was discovered during efforts to synthesise alternatives to quinine as anti-malarials.”Regarding the recipe, Dr Wheate told AAP FactCheck that he could not find any scientific evidence of quinine in grapefruit peels.He added that a person would “probably need an entire bag full of peel to be able to get enough quinine from it to actually do anything”.Dr Wheate said quinine and hydroxychloroquine in their natural forms do not dissolve well in water and someone using the recipe would need to drink an “unhealthy” amount of water – about five litres per day – for it to have any effect.“Quinine is massively dangerous chemical for people to be taking – it has really bad side effects,” he warned.“If you get the dose wrong and take too much, you can get in serious trouble.” A pharmaceutical expert told AAP FactCheck he couldn’t find any evidence of quinine in grapefruit peels.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3064382113687159&set=a.121878734604193&type=3&theater,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-6/,https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/Hydroxychloroquine.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/Hydroxychloroquine.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1lVp5ucnLK9g_crh1lro-BHlgFiqXT7sOP30lNVtTLvWCxZT5dcbB4MuM,https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phar.2387,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/7/et-2107_article,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chinin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548596/,https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nial-wheate.html,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/nial-wheate/,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.armstrong,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-quinine/fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-is-not-the-same-as-quinine-and-cant-be-made-at-home-idUSKBN2370R9",Homemade grapefruit recipe won’t make hydroxychloroquine,,,,,,

The temple’s video of her visit has been viewed on Facebook more than 2.6 million times.The visit was also attended by India’s High Commissioner to New Zealand, Muktesh Pardeshi, who posted pictures of the event on his Twitter account. However, the caption on the Facebook post is incorrect in stating Ms Ardern visited the temple after declaring New Zealand COVID-19 free.On June 8, Ms Ardern announced (video mark 20min36sec) NZ had “no active cases” of COVID-19 for the first time since February 28. On August 6, the date of the prime minister’s visit, NZ’s Ministry of Health reported no new cases of COVID-19 and that it had been 97 days since the last one. Three days later, NZ marked 100 days “since the last case of COVID-19 was acquired locally”, a situation that held until August 11, when four new cases of community transmission were reported in South Auckland.AAP FactCheck sought comment from the NZ prime minister’s office regarding the post’s claims but received no reply at the time of publication.

(Video mark 21min 52sec)Mr Twyford’s office told AAP FactCheck the funding allocation was detailed in the 2015 Government Policy Statement on Land Transport (GPS), produced under the National government, and the 2018 GPS, produced by the Labour coalition.The GPS sets out the government’s priorities for transport for the next 10 years and is released every three years.The Transport Minister’s office said the documents showed public transport spending had tripled, increasing from $4.585 billion in the 2015 GPS (page 33), to $13.715 billion in the 2018 GPS (page 38/39).The budget tables split funding into a number of ‘activity classes’, and Mr Twyford’s office said its calculations combined funding for the ‘public transport’, ‘rapid transit’ and ‘transitional rail’ activity classes.However, prior to 2018, state-owned enterprise KiwiRail managed rail spending, so ‘transitional rail’ was not included in the 2015 GPS. This means it is not possible to do a direct comparison across the two GPS reports.In total, $815 million was allocated to ‘transitional rail’ in the 2018 GPS (page 37) and when this category is excluded, it shows public transport spending increased by 181 per cent when compared to the 2015 GPS.The GPS funding for each activity class is expressed as a range, and the above calculations were based on the highest possible figures in those ranges.When the lowest figures in the range are used, it shows a 150 per cent increase in spending. If the average of each range is used, it shows an increase of 179 per cent.However, the Ministry of Transport said GPS documents dealt with priorities rather than specific expenditure. It told AAP FactCheck the government’s annual transport budget, Vote Transport, provided a better comparison as it included specific budgets, rather than funding ranges.Each year, the budget details public transport spending across ferries, trains and buses.It also includes budget lines for the Auckland City Rail Link, the Wellington metro rail network upgrade, funding for light rail and busways called ‘rapid transit’, upgrades to passenger rail services called ‘transitional rail’ and a public transport subsidy for seniors called the SuperGold Card.AAP FactCheck compared these Vote Transport budget lines for the last term of the National government (2015 pages 190, 191 and 210; 2016 pages 178, 179 and 201; 2017 pages 147, 148 and 170) and the current government (2018 pages 158, 159, 186 and 206; 2019 pages 190, 191, 225 and 251; 2020 pages 190, 191, 225 and 251).The National budgets allocated a total of $1484.603 million on these initiatives between 2015 and 2017, or an average of $494.867 million a year.The Labour government allocated $2825.545 million, or an average of $941.848 million a year between 2018 and 2020.This equates to an 90.3 per cent increase in public transport funding under Labour compared to the previous government.It is worth noting the Auckland City Rail Link is a seven-year, $4.4 billion project that began during the final year of the National government, so including funding for this project may skew the outcome.When Auckland rail link funding is excluded, the Labour coalition government increased spending by 83.8 per cent compared to National, from $1158.603 million to $2129.444 million.Mr Twyford also said the government had tripled public transport spending in Auckland in particular, however his office did not provide figures to support this.NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said comprehensive figures for government spending on Auckland public transport were not readily available.A comparison table in the government’s 2019 Auckland regional update of the National Land Transport Plan (NLTP), a three-year plan detailing transport spending nationwide, shows public transport spending in the city – but only includes two years of the 2015 NLTP in its funding comparison with the three-year 2018 plan, and no details of what projects are included. The NZ government has defended its spending on rail and other forms of public transport this term.","https://www.threenow.co.nz/shows/newshub-nation/season-2020%253A-saturday-25-july-2020/S1563-088/M39471-304,https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/0e58664df3/GPS-2015-amended.pdf,https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/c6b0fea45a/Government-Policy-Statement-on-land-transport-2018.pdf,https://www.nzta.govt.nz/planning-and-investment/national-land-transport-programme/government-policy-statement-on-land-transport/#:~:text=GPS%202018,a%20period%20of%20public%20consultation.&text=Access%20%E2%80%93%20a%20system%20that%20provides,and%20access%2C%20and%20is%20resilient.,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/0e58664df3/GPS-2015-amended.pdf,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/c6b0fea45a/Government-Policy-Statement-on-land-transport-2018.pdf,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/0e58664df3/GPS-2015-amended.pdf,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/c6b0fea45a/Government-Policy-Statement-on-land-transport-2018.pdf,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/0e58664df3/GPS-2015-amended.pdf,https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/,https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/what-we-do/projects/wellington/the-programme-in-detail/,https://www.supergold.govt.nz/,https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-04/est16-v1-trans.pdf,https://2017.budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v1/est17-v1-trans.pdf,https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-05/est18-v1-trans.pdf,https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-05/est19-v1-trans.pdf,https://budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v1/est20-v1-trans.pdf,https://budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v1/est20-v1-trans.pdf,https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/key-facts,https://www.govt.nz/organisations/new-zealand-transport-agency/,https://www.nzta.govt.nz/planning-and-investment/national-land-transport-programme/2018-21-nltp/regional-update-august-2019/auckland/",Has the NZ government tripled its investment in public transport?,,,,,,

Not another conspiracy theory being validated?”The caption links to a website called Australian National Review which features a response by a “retired paediatrician from New York” on the risk of being more susceptible to coronavirus infections from the flu shot.The August 9 post has received more than 270 shares and more than 27,000 views. A post claims studies show the flu shot will increase a person’s susceptibility to COVID-19. The AnalysisThe post falsely claims medical studies show the flu shot increases the risk of testing positive for COVID-19. There is no evidence to support the claim, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and two experts contacted by AAP FactCheck. Influenza and COVID-19 are caused by different viruses and flu vaccines contain attenuated or killed influenza viruses which won’t give people COVID-19 or make them more susceptible.The post’s claim is from the website Australian National Review which republished a comment on an editorial in the British Medical Journal from February 2020.Responding to Public Health Wales’ consultant epidemiologist John Watkins’ editorial on other methods to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Allan S. Cunningham, a retired paediatrician from New York, said there is a “possibility that seasonal flu shots are potential contributors to the current outbreak”.Cunningham cited a study published in 2012 of a trial which examined whether 115 children vaccinated with the 2008-09 influenza vaccine had a higher chance of being infected with other respiratory diseases.He claimed from the trial “flu shots increased fivefold the risk of acute respiratory infections caused by a group of non-influenza viruses, including coronaviruses”.The CDC stated in April 2020 there is no evidence that “getting a flu vaccine increases the risk of getting COVID-19”. The CDC’s advice is supported by NSW Health who state there is “no evidence yet directly linking flu vaccination with an increased risk of COVID-19”.In August 2020, the CDC said in an article titled, “Misconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines” that flu vaccines are “not thought to make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections”.The CDC referred to the flu vaccination study published in 2012 and concluded: “It’s not clear why this finding was detected in the one study, but the majority of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that flu vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections,” it said.Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck via email there is no evidence that the flu vaccine increases a person’s risk of COVID-19.“These viruses are completely different from each other and there’s no reason biologically or, theoretically, to believe that giving one vaccine will increase the risk of another disease,” he said.Associate Professor Margie Danchin, a vaccine researcher from Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck: “You can’t get the flu from the influenza vaccine. You certainly can’t get coronavirus from a killed influenza vaccine.”She said the study published in 2012 was a “very small study to be drawing such large conclusions”.“There’s no relationship really that can be drawn from this study to the COVID-19 situation whatsoever.”Prof Booy agreed and told AAP FactCheck the study was conducted nearly 10 years ago and “is quite different from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) and has absolutely no relevance to the present day”.Dr Danchin said the study was investigating a phenomenon called “viral interference” to examine whether boosting the body’s immunity against one type of virus will change the body’s ability to effectively respond to other types of viruses.“The study says there was only one coronavirus infection detected, and it was called NL63, which has no relationship to the current coronavirus. Making a connection to COVID-19 from this paper is impossible,” she said.Prof Booy described the study as an “outlier”, saying there needed to be confirmation from “two or three other studies before you’d be worried”. An infectious diseases expert told AAP FactCheck there’s no evidence that a flu shot raises a person’s risk of COVID-19.","http://archive.is/c6YGe,https://australiannationalreview.com/health/medical-studies-showing-the-flu-shot-not-only-increases-susceptibility-to-the-corona-virus-but-could-be-contributing-to-the-outbreak/?fbclid=IwAR1r3-3AvfSbxYuFCmLtpi0wQqpWuCJMv7lBT4cssluBJpwRCFc7VGBtbKU,https://australiannationalreview.com/health/medical-studies-showing-the-flu-shot-not-only-increases-susceptibility-to-the-corona-virus-but-could-be-contributing-to-the-outbreak/?fbclid=IwAR1r3-3AvfSbxYuFCmLtpi0wQqpWuCJMv7lBT4cssluBJpwRCFc7VGBtbKU,https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-0,https://www.rpharms.com/Portals/0/RPS%20Wales%20Med%20Safety%20Programme%202017.pdf,https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810,https://ahrp.org/trzboard/allan-s-cunningham-md/,https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/#!po=31.2500,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#1-12,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm,https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/robert-booy.html,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6018-margie-danchin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918871/","No evidence to link flu vaccinations to increased COVID-19 risk, say experts",,,,,,

The Statement“They should have delivered 16,000 KiwiBuild houses by now. They’ve only managed just around 400. And so to promise 5,000 extra houses a year is nothing more than just wishful thinking and is destined to go the same way as KiwiBuild.”Jacqui Dean, National Party housing spokesperson, August 10, 2020.The AnalysisThe NZ Green Party’s plan to increase the state house build program to 5,000 properties a year has been rubbished as “wishful thinking”, with opponents pointing to the problematic KiwiBuild scheme.The Homes for All policy, revealed on August 9, includes a plan to scale up the Crown build programme to 5,000 new homes a year to address a backlog of 18,520 households waiting for a suitable home to become available. (Page 6)Under Homes for All, the Green Party would extend the borrowing limit for the public housing agency Kainga Ora from $7.1 billion to $12 billion over the next five years to allow 5,000 new homes to be built each year. Kainga Ora would build homes directly, and also contract building work out to community providers.The Green Party’s plan, however, has been dismissed as “wishful thinking” by Opposition housing spokeswoman Jacqui Dean in a Radio New Zealand report on August 10. (Mark 2min 10sec)“They should have delivered 16,000 KiwiBuild houses by now. They’ve only managed just around 400. And so to promise 5,000 extra houses a year is nothing more than just wishful thinking and is destined to go the same way as KiwiBuild,” Ms Dean said.Waitaki MP Ms Dean, in her fifth term in parliament, was appointed as National’s Housing and Urban Development spokesperson on July 16, 2020.AAP FactCheck examined Ms Dean’s claim the government should have already delivered 16,000 KiwiBuild houses, but had only delivered around 400.The affordable housing program known as KiwiBuild was launched in 2018 under the Labour Party-led coalition government. The Green Party signed an agreement to support the Labour Party-New Zealand First Party government following the 2017 general election.KiwiBuild facilitates new housing developments and in return property developers reserve some homes for eligible KiwiBuild buyers.  Eligibility criteria include income caps and commitments to living in the home for a minimum period of time.KiwiBuild aimed to build 1,000 homes in the year to June 2019, 5,000 by June 2020, 10,000 by June 2021, and 12,000 every year after that.However, in September 2019 the government announced it was resetting KiwiBuild.“We’ve made a good start across the wider housing portfolio but KiwiBuild isn’t working so we are changing it,” Housing Minister Megan Woods said in a release on September 4, 2019.Ms Woods said a target of 100,000 houses over 10 years was being dropped in favour of building as many houses as possible in the right locations, and on October 1, 2019, KiwiBuild became part of Kainga Ora.According to the latest dashboard of housing statistics, released monthly as a record of government progress towards its housing goal, by June 30, 2020, 452 KiwiBuild homes had been completed. This is at odds with Ms Dean’s claim only 400 homes were finished.Ms Dean’s assertion on August 10, 2020 that 16,000 KiwiBuild houses should already have been delivered (Mark 2min 10sec) does not match the June 2021 timeline originally set by KiwiBuild. The NZ Green Party’s housing policy has been labelled “wishful thinking”.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/new-zealand-scraps-overly-ambitious-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis,https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/beachheroes/pages/13481/attachments/original/1596920689/Homes_for_All_-_policy_document.pdf?1596920689,https://kaingaora.govt.nz/about-us/who-we-are/,https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018758721/green-party-wants-to-ramp-up-social-housing-construction,http://www.parliament.nz/mi/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/dean-jacqui/,https://www.labour.org.nz/faq_kiwibuild,https://www.parliament.nz/media/4487/nzlp___gp_c_s_agreement.pdf,https://www.kiwibuild.govt.nz/about/about-kiwibuild/,https://www.kiwibuild.govt.nz/buying-a-kiwibuild-home/are-you-eligible/,https://www.labour.org.nz/faq_kiwibuild,https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/woods-megan/,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-resets-kiwibuild-help-more-new-zealanders-home-ownership,https://www.hud.govt.nz/residential-housing/kiwibuild/,https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/News-and-Resources/Statistics-and-Research/Housing-Dashboard-2020/Housing-Dashboard-June-2020.pdf,https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018758721/green-party-wants-to-ramp-up-social-housing-construction",NZ National Party builds a flawed case against Green Party housing plan targets,,,,,,

The post’s claim goes against advice outlined by the World Health Organization.In an instructional video (1min14sec) on March 9, Dr April Baller from WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme explains how to wear a medical mask correctly.Dr Baller says the inside of the mask is “usually the white side”, advice she reiterates in another video on June 5.Providing more detail, Dr Seto Wing Hong, co-director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, addresses the claim in this video.“You see it (the mask) has the blue colour on the outside because it is waterproof and then you have white on the inside because it is absorbent,” he said. “So, if I cough, it absorbs it… so, you gotta wear it like this – blue on the outside, white on the inside.”In the same video, Dr Wing Hong also stresses the importance of wearing the mask the correct way up, with the metal wired edge running over the nose.A WHO infographic details how to wear a medical mask safely with an instruction that says “ensure the coloured-side faces outwards”. There is no advice that the coloured and white sides are used to indicate the health of the wearer.Versions of the post have been fact checked here, here, here and here. WHO says people wearing medical masks should “ensure the coloured-side faces outwards”.","http://archive.is/St5l0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4olt47pr_o#action=share,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adB8RW4I3o4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vdi0o5K9OqE,https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/masks-infographic---final-(web---rgb).png?sfvrsn=c67232f0_15,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-two-color-medical-masks-blu/fact-checktwo-tonemedical-masks-should-be-wornwithcolor-side-facing-out-idUSKBN249290,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/14/facebook-posts/medical-masks-should-be-worn-colored-side-out/,https://www.boomlive.in/health/is-there-a-right-way-to-wear-a-surgical-mask-a-factcheck-6750,https://factcheck.afp.com/china-coronavirus-health-experts-refute-misinformation-about-how-wear-face-masks",Medical mask colour instructions are misleading and false,,,,,,
152,,,,Ambiguous,,2020-08-13,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/will-legalising-cannabis-lead-to-more-drug-driving/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Has driving under the influence of cannabis increased in Canada and the US state of Colorado since recreational cannabis use was legalised?The Statement“We should look at the experiences of states in America like Colorado, like Canada and those, and if we look at their experience and we take for instance drug driving, in those jurisdictions we’ve seen increased incidence.”Nick Smith, NZ National Party MP, August 8, 2020.The AnalysisAs New Zealand prepares to decide whether cannabis should be legalised, politicians are turning to other jurisdictions for answers about the potential impacts on public safety.During a debate with Green Party MP Chloe Swarbrick on Newshub Nation, National Party MP Nick Smith said legalising recreational cannabis may result in more people driving under the influence of the drug. (video mark 3mins 25sec)“Both myself and Chloe are agreeing that cannabis is harmful and so then the argument is that by legalising and putting regulation around it are you going to reduce the harm,” Mr Smith said.“And we should look at the experiences of states in America like Colorado, like Canada and those, and if we look at their experience and if we take for instance drug driving, in those jurisdictions we’ve seen increased incidence.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Smith’s statement that increased numbers of people were driving under the influence of cannabis in Colorado and Canada following legalisation of the drug there.Mr Smith directed AAP FactCheck to a report titled The Legalisation of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact, produced by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program in 2019.The program was established by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy in 1996 to reduce drug trafficking in Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.It has produced an annual report on the impacts of cannabis in Colorado since the drug was legalised in the state in 2013.In the executive summary on page one, the report states there has been a significant increase in traffic deaths where drivers tested positive for cannabis, rising from 55 in 2013, to 115 in 2018. It also found the percentage of traffic deaths that were “marijuana related” increased from 15 per cent to 23 per cent in the same period.It is noteworthy that, according to the same report, the percentage of “marijuana related” traffic deaths also doubled in the five years prior to legalisation – 7.8 per cent in 2008, to 14.7 per cent in 2013 (page 11).The annual report also said the number of drivers who tested positive for cannabis increased by 49 per cent between 2013 and 2018 (page 14), while the number of drivers charged with driving under the influence of cannabis increased by 58 per cent from 2014 to 2018 (page 19).The report does not analyse whether testing for cannabis increased during this period, nor compare the trends to other states where cannabis is not legal.The Office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor recently investigated the possible impacts of legalising cannabis, including the impact on drug-driving, and released a summary of the evidence in July.Senior research and policy analyst Dr Rachel Chiaroni-Clarke, who worked on the NZ report, said the Colorado research should be “interpreted with caution”.It is not peer reviewed, the analysis is “fairly rudimentary”, and there’s limited detail on how the data is collected and analysed, and what controls are used, she said.“The (Colorado) report counts a marijuana-related incident as ‘any time marijuana shows up in the toxicology report’ which isn’t actually a measure of impairment at the time of the crash (i.e. the person may have used cannabis in recent days), though it is noted the levels in blood ‘indicated use within hours’ for some of the drivers but not all,” Dr Chiaroni-Clarke said in a statement to AAP FactCheck.“It also says some cannabis citations include those where ‘marijuana was present based on officer opinion only’.”The Office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor analysed a range of studies to determine whether legalisation would impact incidence of drug-driving and found overall, the evidence was not clear. This was addressed in the Frequently Asked Questions section of the report titled: ‘Will there be more accidents if cannabis is legalised?’.The Chief Science Advisor’s report found two studies where legalising recreational cannabis had no effect on traffic fatalities, two studies where fatal crash rates increased after cannabis stores opened and one study with conflicting results between two different states.Dr Chiaroni-Clarke said the Office was unable to find any evidence “relating to changes in the number of people driving under the influence of cannabis in states that have legalised”.An article in the New Zealand Medical Journal which looked at the potential health impacts of cannabis legalisation found that, while some states that legalised cannabis had seen an increase in drug driving, this was “not necessarily beyond pre-legalisation trends”.In Canada, research indicates no increase in drug-driving since the country legalised recreational cannabis in October 2018, but there is limited information available.Statistics Canada has been surveying about 5,500 Canadians on their cannabis consumption every three months since February 2018.The most recent survey, released in February 2020, shows the proportion of respondents who reported driving within two hours of using cannabis in the past three months declined from 14.2 per cent in 2018, to 13.2 per cent in 2019.It also showed the proportion who had been a passenger in a vehicle operated by a driver who had recently consumed cannabis also dropped from 5.3 per cent in 2018, to 4.2 per cent in 2019.AAP FactCheck found no definitive academic research into whether there had been an increase in drivers testing positive for cannabis impairment post-legalisation. However, The Canadian Press reported that there had been no increase in the number of convictions of impaired drivers six months after legalisation in Canada. An NZ MP claims the number of people driving under the influence of cannabis has risen in Canada.","https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/cannabis-referendum-chloe-swarbrick-and-nick-smith-get-fired-up-over-cannabis.html,https://rmhidta.org/files/D2DF/FINAL-Volume6.pdf,https://rmhidta.org/(X(1)S(uaadamceccfd3p23vmcb35au))/default.aspx?menuitemid=781&menugroup=RMHIDTA+Public+Overview,https://rmhidta.org/files/D2DF/FINAL-Volume6.pdf,https://rmhidta.org/files/D2DF/FINAL-Volume6.pdf,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/cannabis/,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/who-we-are/our-office/,https://rmhidta.org/files/D2DF/FINAL-Volume6.pdf,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/cannabis/,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/cannabis/,https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/new-zealands-cannabis-legalisation-and-regulation-bill-an-evidence-based-assessment-and-critique-of-essential-regulatory-components-towards-policy-outcomes,https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2020002/article/00002-eng.htm,https://globalnews.ca/news/5201426/cannabis-impaired-driving-charges-rcmp/",Will legalising cannabis lead to more drug-driving?,,,,,,

It also claims a 99.5 per cent “survival rate” for the coronavirus.The post features an image of a yellow map of Australia in the background with text that begins with, “Dear Australia” before asking a series of questions including: “A virus with a 99.5% survival rate that has killed fewer than the normal flu season?” and “a virus that the test can’t identify separately from the flu?” A caption further claims the test can’t tell the difference COVID-19 and the common cold.The August 5 post has received more than 300 shares and more than 21,000 views. A Facebook post claims tests in Australia can’t distinguish between COVID-19 and the flu. The AnalysisThere are currently two tests used to diagnose COVID-19 in Australia: the reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test and the point-of-care antibody serology test. The claim about the ability of the tests to detect COVID-19 contradicts advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal Department of Health and two virology experts contacted by AAP FactCheck.The Facebook post also repeats a previously debunked claim about the “survival rate” of COVID-19.The PCR test, one of the two tests used to diagnose COVID-19 in Australia, swabs the back of the throat and up the nose to detect SARS-CoV-2, the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Point-of-care serology tests are conducted outside of laboratories to analyse a person’s body fluids using mobile devices to provide real-time results, according to NSW Health. This method can detect COVID-19 antibodies through a blood or finger prick test.A Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that real-time PCR tests are “the primary method of diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection”.The PCR test is “specific to SARS-COV-2 and will reliably detect SARS-COV-2 (ribonucleic acid) RNA whether the virus is viable or not”, the spokesperson said.Dr Ian Mackay, a virologist and adjunct associate professor with the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck PCR tests are “extremely effective at very sensitively and specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2”.“The tests detect the viral sequences we expect them to and not other viruses,” he said.Regarding the claim the tests can’t identify COVID-19 from the flu and common cold, Professor Bill Rawlinson, a senior medical virologist at the University of NSW, told AAP FactCheck this assertion was “completely wrong”.“COVID-19-specific serology and PCR tests will not detect flu and common cold viruses unless you use the flu PCR and flu serology or rhinovirus serology and rhinovirus PCR,” Prof Rawlinson said.“The SARS-Coronavirus-2 antibody tests are specific for SARS-Coronavirus-2 and don’t detect the other antibodies to the other coronaviruses.”The claim that PCR tests inaccurately detect COVID-19 has previously been debunked by AAP FactCheck. The post also claims the survival rate for COVID-19 is 99.5 per cent, however it is unclear how the figure was calculated or its source.AAP FactCheck previously checked a similar claim on the supposed COVID-19 survival rates for other countries and found they were calculated to show the deaths as a proportion of that country’s population.Professor Robyn Lucas, head of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, previously said this method was misleading as it is “using the whole population, rather than the number who have diagnosed infection”.“So this is not really ‘survival’ – to survive a disease you have to have the disease in the first place,” she told AAP FactCheck.Prof Lucas said if a “survival rate” for COVID-19 was to be calculated, it would be by dividing the number of people who survived infection by the number who have had the illness.“But even then there will be variability based on the definition of the group that has had the illness. Is it the number diagnosed with the illness, the number hospitalised with the illness, or the number who probably have the illness (i.e. including those we think are asymptomatic)?” she said.“Depending on which group is used, you will get vastly different results.” A medical officer holds a swab while administering a test for COVID-19.","http://archive.is/uiDPv,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Factsheet-for-Patients-2019-nCoV.pdf,https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-testing-australia-information-health-professionals#:~:text=PCR%20tests%20are%20currently%20considered,an%20indicator%20for%20viral%20shedding.,https://www.pathology.health.nsw.gov.au/clinical-services/point-of-care-testing,https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-testing-australia-information-health-professionals,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/4428,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-william-rawlinson,https://www.aap.com.au/pcr-inventor-who-died-in-2019-did-not-say-his-test-wont-work-for-covid-19-infections/,https://www.aap.com.au/survival-rates-claim-isnt-part-of-the-covid-19-equation/,http://archive.is/deOp7,https://rsph.anu.edu.au/research/centres-departments/national-centre-epidemiology-population-health",False COVID-19 test and survival rate claims resurface,,,,,,
154,,,,Mostly False,,2020-08-11,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-support-for-national-leaders-child-poverty-claims/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Has child poverty increased under the Labour coalition government?The Statement“Child poverty, has that gone up or down before Covid? Well, it went up.”Judith Collins, National Party leader, August 5, 2020.The AnalysisThe Labour Party came to power in 2017 after campaigning to lift 100,000 children out of poverty in New Zealand, but three years on the government is being criticised for failing to deliver.When National Party leader Judith Collins appeared on The AM Show, she criticised Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s progress on addressing child poverty.“What’s she delivered? Child poverty, has that gone up or down before Covid? Well, it went up.” (video mark 3min 30sec)AAP FactCheck examined the claim that child poverty increased under the Labour coalition government prior to the emergence of Covid-19.The National Party leader’s office said the statement was based on the latest child poverty statistics, produced by Stats NZ. The statistics are produced each year as a requirement of the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018. They are based on the Household Economic Survey, which surveys 20,000 people aged 15 and over.It includes figures for nine measures of child poverty (three primary measures and six supplementary measures) which are used to assess the government’s progress towards its targets to reduce child poverty.February was the first time the report has been released as part of the Child Poverty Reduction Act and the most recent figures cover the year to June 2019.In the ‘key facts’ summary of the report, it states that while some measures of child poverty had declined slightly, the changes were not “statistically significant”.However, Collins’ press secretary Simon Clarke said the figures showed there were 20,000 more children living in poverty since Jacinda Ardern became prime minister.This is based on the supplementary measure of the number of children living in households with an income less than 60 per cent of the median disposable income before housing costs (also called measure ‘e’) between 2016/17 and 2018/19.Between 2016/17 and 2018/19, the number of children in this category increased from 243,300 to 263,400 (table 4.01).However, the figures for 2017/18 have been excluded from this comparison. When these figures are included, it shows the number of children in this category decreased by 17,800 between 2017/18 and 2018/19.It should also be noted that figures before 2018/19 had a much smaller sample size – between 3,500 to 5,500 households – and a larger margin of error.Because of this, the https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019“>Stats NZ website advises caution in comparing the figures.“We encourage users to look at trends over several years. Small changes year on year are unlikely to be statistically significant because they fall within the range of expected uncertainty,” it states.Regarding the figures, AAP FactCheck sought expert opinion from Victoria University of Wellington public policy Professor Jonathan Boston. Prof Boston co-chaired the government’s Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty in 2012 and has written and co-authored several books on the topic.Prof Boston said the most recent figures do not show that child poverty has increased and to say the figures show the government has failed to address child poverty would be misrepresenting the data.“It would be inaccurate to say child poverty has gone up,” he said. “That is wrong. The best construction is that, at best, there has been a modest reduction in child poverty.”He said comparing just one of the nine measures on child poverty may be misleading, especially if only two dates are used in the comparison due to the margin of error in the surveys.Furthermore, Prof Boston said the 2018/19 survey cannot be used to establish whether child poverty has increased or decreased under the Labour coalition as the survey partially covers the term of the National government.The Household Economic Survey is conducted throughout the year and asks participants about their economic position over the previous 12 months. The 2018/19 survey captures information about people’s situation between July 2017 and June 2019, including three months of the previous National government.For example, a person surveyed in July 2018 will provide information about their circumstances between July 2017 and July 2018 and these figures will be included in the 2018/19 report.The 2018/19 survey also only partially covers the government’s major initiatives to reduce child poverty in the Families Package, which took effect in July 2018. The 2019/20 survey will be the first covering an entire year of the Labour coalition and this isn’t expected to be released until early 2021.However, Treasury forecasts suggest child poverty rates reduced significantly before COVID-19.Treasury reports on the government’s progress towards meeting its child poverty reduction goals in the budget each year.The 2020 Child Poverty Report found that, based on projections, child poverty rates were expected to have dropped markedly and the government was “broadly on track” to meet two out of three of its three-year targets before COVID-19.(Treasury said it wasn’t possible to model progress for the third measure on material hardship).The projections were based on the expected economic impact of a range of government initiatives, which are detailed in the report. NZ child poverty rates reduced significantly before COVID-19, Treasury forecasts suggest.","https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/nz-election-2020-judith-collins-won-t-implement-no-mistakes-rule-for-national-mps.html,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2018/0057/18.0/LMS8294.html,https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/latest-child-poverty-statistics-released,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019,https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Child-poverty-statistics/Child-poverty-statistics-Year-ended-June-2019/Download-data/child-poverty-statistics-year-ended-june-2019-1.xlsx,https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/latest-child-poverty-statistics-released,https://<a href=,https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/Jonathan.Boston,https://www.bwb.co.nz/authors/jonathan-boston,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/families-package-helps-over-1-million-new-zealanders-first-year,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/wellbeing/child-poverty-report/index.htm,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/wellbeing/child-poverty-report/trends-prior-to-covid-19.htm,https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/wellbeing/child-poverty-report/appendix-b.htm",No support for NZ National leader’s child poverty claim,,,,,,
155,,,,The Verdict,,2020-08-07,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-about-covid-tests-and-famous-new-zealand-visitors/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA YouTube video posted on Facebook titled, “Strange things are happening in New Zealand”, claims the RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction) test used to detect COVID-19 is not an appropriate testing method.The video by Dr Rashid A Buttar also claims that tech entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Larry Page visited NZ recently and that COVID-19 is no different to the common cold.The July 29 post to a Facebook group called Spiritual Renaissance NZ Unleashed, has gathered more than 50 reactions and 25 shares and links to Dr Buttar’s YouTube video which has been viewed more than 354,000 times. A video post claims RT-PCR tests used to detect COVID-19 aren’t an appropriate testing method. The AnalysisThe post’s video claims the RT-PCR test is not viable for detecting viruses and that the inventor who developed the test in the 1980s argued the same. The claim about the test’s efficacy goes against published advice from the US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the UK’s NHS. The purported quote used in the video is in fact not from the inventor of the PCR test.The video also repeats previously debunked claims that Microsoft founder Bill Gates visited New Zealand recently and that COVID-19 is no different to the common cold.Dr Rashid A Buttar is described on his website as the medical director of The Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research in Cornelius, North Carolina. The site claims the centre’s treatments – specialising in detoxification and enhancing the immune system – “are so effective that even the North Carolina Medical Board is trying to suppress the truth”.Near the five minute mark of the video, Dr Buttar claims there is an “exponentially increasing rate of diagnostics showing positive for COVID-19 despite the real-time PCR testing … not being an appropriate testing methodology that would actually indicate anything that was viable”. He cites PCR inventor Dr Kary Mullis and says the Nobel Prize winner “actually said you cannot use the RT- PCR testing for diagnosing a viral or a bacterial infection or any other type of infectious type of pathology”.The quote on the PCR test used by Dr Buttar comes from a 1996 magazine article about HIV/AIDS and is not from Dr Mullis. The quote, which has previously been fact checked, wasn’t made by Dr Mullis and is in fact an extract from the article, which was written by New York writer John Lauritsen. In the article Lauritsen uses a quote from Dr Mullis – “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron” – but then continues with his own writing to say: “PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers”.The false attribution of the quote to Mullis has previously been addressed  here, here and here.A CDC fact sheet on PCR states the test is designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19. In the UK, the NHS says its preferred screening/testing is molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 using real-time PCR.Dr Buttar also claims that Mr Gates, who he says is close friends with NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, was in NZ “as of a few weeks ago”. He adds: “Apparently so is Larry Page from Google.” AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims that Mr Gates visited NZ in 2020 with a statement from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ms Ardern gave an address at the Gates Foundation’s Goal Keepers Summit in New York in September 2019. There is no evidence that Mr Page visited NZ recently.Near the end of the video, Dr Buttar says COVID-19 is no different to the common cold. WHO lists common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, and tiredness but can also  “range from no symptoms… to severe pneumonia or death”. The CDC lists symptoms of the common cold to include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches. The CDC also states on its website that the “virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.” AAP FactCheck has previously debunked this claim.  A video posted on Facebook claims Microsoft founder Bill Gates visited New Zealand recently. The VerdictBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Dr Rashid Buttar’s claims about the value of PCR testing are not supported by advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US or the NHS in the UK. The quote on the PCR test used by Dr Buttar is not from Dr Kary Mullis and is taken out of context.There is no evidence that Bill Gates or Larry Page visited New Zealand in recent months.The CDC states the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the same as coronaviruses that cause the common cold.False – The primary claims of the video’s content are factually inaccurate.* AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/","http://archive.today/Wwgg8,https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download,https://www.cdc.gov/about/default.htm,https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/guidance-and-sop-covid-19-virus-testing-in-nhs-laboratories-v1.pdf,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Bio,https://www.drbuttar.com/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1993/mullis/facts/,http://archive.today/onUc7,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr/fact-check-inventor-of-method-used-to-test-for-covid-19-didnt-say-it-cant-be-used-in-virus-detection-idUSKBN24420X,https://www.aap.com.au/pcr-inventor-who-died-in-2019-did-not-say-his-test-wont-work-for-covid-19-infections/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/07/blog-posting/covid-19-tests-are-not-scientifically-meaningless/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr/fact-check-inventor-of-method-used-to-test-for-covid-19-didnt-say-it-cant-be-used-in-virus-detection-idUSKBN24420X,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Factsheet-for-Patients-2019-nCoV.pdf,https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/guidance-and-sop-covid-19-virus-testing-in-nhs-laboratories-v1.pdf,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Larry-Page,https://www.aap.com.au/bill-gates-wasnt-in-new-zealand-this-year-and-those-microchip-claims-have-already-been-debunked/,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2019/09/Goalkeepers-2019-NYC-Event-Press-Release,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cdcresponse/about-COVID-19.html,https://www.aap.com.au/coronavirus-does-not-just-equal-the-common-cold/,http://www.aap.com.au/coronavirus-does-not-just-equal-the-common-cold/%5D,https://aap.com.au/",False claims about COVID tests and famous New Zealand visitors,,,,,,

Prof Petrovsky was interviewed about the findings of a study into the origins of COVID-19 he conducted with researchers at Victoria’s La Trobe University.The video makes several claims about Prof Petrovsky’s May 2020 research, which looked into the origins of COVID-19 using computer modelling to better understand the transmission of the virus in a bid to find a vaccine.The video begins with host Ben Swann saying: “A brand new study out of Australia by a team of scientists claims that the coronavirus is in fact human-made and did not occur naturally in nature as we have been told so many times over the past few months”.In an emailed response to AAP FactCheck, Prof Petrovsky rejected Mr Swann’s claim.“All we said was that the virus had surprising features that were hard to explain, particularly it being perfectly adapted to human spread from the very first isolates,” the professor said.“I clearly said we do not yet know the origins of the virus, which may have come from animals as has been the case in the past, but the possibility of a laboratory leak of a lab created virus also cannot be excluded without proper investigation.”Prof Petrovsky said the post’s headline, “AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS US GOVERNMENT-FUNDED BIOWEAPON” was “completely false”.“I said nothing about bioweapons, where it could have been created etc as implied by this headline,” he said.In the video at 1min 28sec, Mr Swann says five Australian scientists working on a COVID-19 vaccine “found some very strange things” while studying the pathogen. He said the scientists believe “there is almost no way that COVID-19 originated in nature”. He then claims: “Instead, they say, it’s almost impossible that it’s not human-made.”Prof Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck: “As authors we did not say this.”At 2min, 19sec, Mr Swann says: “Nikolai Petrovsky, the lead researcher, said his team suspects human manipulation in Wuhan because of the unmatched ability of the virus’s protruding spike to infect human cells. The virus’s binding strength for human cells ‘far exceeds’ similar properties for infecting other animals, he said in a statement on the forthcoming report.” The post’s video includes excerpts of an interview with Prof Petrovsky on Sky News on May 24.On Mr Swann’s statement, Prof Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck the second part of the statement, regarding the binding strength of the virus, was accurate “but the introduction is incorrect – I avoided saying I had any reason to believe the virus was man made – simply saying this possibility could not be excluded based on current information.”In the Sky News interview (3min 26sec), Prof Petrovsky said: “We really don’t know where this virus has come from… that’s the truth… The two possibilities, which I think are both still open, are firstly that it was a chance transmission of a virus from an as yet unidentified animal to humans. The other possibility of course is that it was an accidental release of the virus from a laboratory.”Prof Petrovsky said his quotes, findings and opinions were correctly presented in the Sky News interview with Sharri Markson. Asked about the context in which the interview excerpts were used in the post, Prof Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck: “This post is completely misleading and a distortion of our paper and what I was saying in the interview.” Professor Nikolai Petrovsky in the Flinders University lab with a vaccine specimen.","http://archive.is/5Nti1/image,https://truthinmedia.com/about/,https://truthinmedia.com/multiple-scientists-c0r0navlrus-in-lab/,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6158843835001,https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/nikolai.petrovsky,https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06199,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-covid-mystery.html,https://truthinmedia.com/multiple-scientists-c0r0navlrus-in-lab/,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6158843835001,https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6158843835001","COVID-19 video post misleading and a distortion, says Aussie scientist",,,,,,

Below the text is an aerial photo of a very large crowd of people massed across a city bridge over a waterway and along the banks on either side.The post has been shared more than 750 times. The same image, claiming to be from the Germany protest, has been used in other posts such as here and has also been shared multiple times on Twitter including here and here. A Facebook post claims a photograph shows crowds marching against COVID-19 restrictions in Berlin The AnalysisLarge crowds did indeed gather in Berlin on Saturday, August 1 to protest against measures put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Germany but the photo in the post is not of those crowds, which were much smaller.The march, which reportedly included violence against police and were attended by some people claiming the pandemic is a “false alarm”  drew between 17,000 to 20,000 people according to news reports. The marchers were criticised by Berlin’s mayor for not wearing masks or social distancing, and more than 130 people were arrested, according to Deutsche Welle news.There were also reports anti-vaccination and far-right groups were involved.However, a reverse image search of the photo in the post using Tineye reveals that the photo used on the Facebook post is not from the German protest but rather from a large music festival held in Switzerland in 2019. It is from a gallery of photos shot at a music festival called Street Parade held in Zurich, Switzerland in 2019.Described as one of the world’s biggest house and techno events, Street Parade reportedly draws up to 1 million visitors a year to the festival.A similar image taken at the same event is available on the Street Parade website in the multimedia gallery.The 2019 event drew a crowd of 850,000 people according to organisers, many times more than the 20,000 estimated to be at the Berlin protest on the weekend. A photo from huge dance music festival in Switzerland was presented as a photo of a Berlin protest.","http://archive.is/pTn47,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/coronavirus-australia-live-news-victorias-mystery-cases-cause-for-alarm-as-stage-4-lockdown-looms/news-story/f0646d09c0efdc61d56398adcc5ba980,http://archive.today/DXZAs,http://archive.is/oJ0JT,http://archive.is/ZM5kG,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/world/dense-crowd-in-thousands-protest-covid-19-restrictions-berlin,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-45-officers-injured-at-berlin-rally-against-coronavirus-curbs/a-54402885 ,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/01/world/berlin-germany-covid-19-protest-intl/index.html,https://tineye.com/search/44255c10020423250f4f81c7b89074c16e3e7fe2?page=1,https://www.streetparade.com/media/filer_public/7b/8e/7b8e058e-d2b4-41cd-bf1e-3891cbd9e50a/heli_2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg ,https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/street-parade,https://www.timeout.com/switzerland/music/zurich-street-parade ,https://www.streetparade.com/en/multimedia/pictures/,https://www.streetparade.com/media/cabinet/2019/08/MM_NachParade_EN.pdf",Photo of huge crowd isn’t from German anti-mask parade – it’s from a Swiss dance music party,,,,,,

They said it looked like childish scribbles. Little did they know, they were the drawings of several young victims of sex trafficking who tried to explain their pain through pictures. They mocked her raising awareness for the victims of sex trafficking. This deserves 100,000 shares!”The July 24 post has attracted more than 20,000 views and more than 250 shares. A Facebook post claims Melania Trump wore a dress that featured drawings by child abuse victims. The AnalysisSo did US first lady Melania Trump wear a white dress featuring drawings by child sex abuse survivors for a US Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore? The short answer is no and the drawings on the dress were created by fashion students not children.US President Donald Trump and the first lady attended the July 3 pre-Independence Day celebration at Keystone, South Dakota. The photograph in the Facebook post shows Mrs Trump wearing the dress designed by British fashion label Alexander McQueen.The post’s opening line that “the media mocked First Lady Melania’s dress” refers to stories (here, here and here) reporting on the social media reaction to the dress.A Facebook post from the Alexander McQueen fashion label explains that the art featured on the dress are “continuous, spontaneous sketches of dancing girls” designed by students at London art school Central Saint Martins during a life drawing class. The dress was part of the label’s Spring/Summer 2020 collection.Further details are found on Stitch-School website where Sarah Burton, the director of the Alexander McQueen label, explained that the design had been the result of a mass crafting experiment. Burton said the dress should be credited to staff across the company “since everyone from the press team to the interns had been involved in its creation”.Versions of the post circulated across social media and have been fact checked here, here, here, here and here. US President Donald Trump with first lady Melania Trump as they arrive at Mount Rushmore on July 3.","http://archive.is/pxmhh,https://www.instagram.com/flotus/,https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm,https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/donald-j-trump/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-south-dakotas-2020-mount-rushmore-fireworks-celebration-keystone-south-dakota/,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2020-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/collection#10,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8489159/Social-media-mocks-Lady-Melania-Trumps-2-400-Alexander-McQueen-dress.html,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1305239/Melania-Trump-news-First-lady-4-July-Independence-Day-Donald-Trump-president,https://honey.nine.com.au/latest/melanias-2400-dress-mocked/43614ecb-d884-4667-9ff4-4b8497dfc352,http://archive.is/n1IVv,https://www.alexandermcqueen.com/en-au,https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins,https://www.stitch-school.com/mcqueen,https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/designers/sarah-burton/news-story/1c207a38482b85b1ce5d98ff01e02c6e,https://www.stitch-school.com/mcqueen,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-melania-dress-july-3/fact-check-melania-trumps-mt-rushmore-dress-not-designed-by-child-victims-of-sex-trafficking-idUSKBN2482CE,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/08/fact-check-melania-trumps-dress-didnt-feature-victims-drawings/5396784002/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/melania-alexander-mcqueen-dress/,https://factcheck.afp.com/melania-trumps-dress-did-not-feature-drawings-child-sex-abuse-victims,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/06/facebook-posts/no-first-ladys-dress-was-not-designed-drawings-sex/",Back to the drawing board for claims about Melania’s dress,,,,,,

It also claims the vaccine “killed five people” during human trials.The post presents the supposed choice as “a predicament”.The July 25 post has been viewed more than 87,200 times and shared more than 924 times. A post makes false claims about the COVID-19 recovery rate and a vaccine that’s not available. The AnalysisThis Facebook post misrepresents the Covid-19 recovery rate as being 99.9 per cent – it is not – and makes false and misleading claims about a vaccine that is not even available, including the unsubstantiated claim that people died during testing.While the post doesn’t mention a specific vaccine, the original poster subsequently refers in comments to “The Moderna RNA” vaccine, saying it has an “80% adverse reaction rate” and “has killed 5 people so far in the trials”.Biotech lab Moderna is working with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on a COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna RNA vaccine is among more than 15 currently being trialled around the world. and is one of the few that has already begun its last stage of testing.Moderna reported in first phase trials of its mRNA-1273 vaccine , that “no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified”, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.The U.S Department of Health and Human Services concluded that in terms of safety, there were no serious adverse events reported. Following the trial, Moderna said in a statement on July 14 that “mRNA-1273 was generally safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported” over the eight-week period of the trial.The statement noted that “systemic adverse events” – which relates to effects that occur away from the injection site – were more common after the second of two shots of the vaccine, which was administered to three groups at three different doses: 25micrograms (mcg), 100 mcg and 250mcg. It said the most common adverse reaction after the second shot for recipients of the 100mcg dose “were fatigue (80%), chills (80%), headache (60%) and myalgia (53%), all of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity.”The 80 percent for fatigue and chills appears to be where the Facebook post sourced its “80%” figure.However the suggestion that anyone could “get the vaccine with its 80% adverse reaction rate” is completely misleading. The percentage relates to results in some recipients in an early stage clinical trial of a vaccine. No vaccine has reached final production and no vaccine is available for anyone to “get”.The phase three trial of the Moderna vaccine, involving up to 30,000 participants, only began on July 27 and is not due to be completed until October 27, 2020.Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of NSW Guy Marks said the COVID-19 recovery rate presented in the Facebook post was “absolutely false.”Professor Marks said country-specific data on mortality rates from Sars COV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 –  produced by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center -shows the average mortality rate of all countries combined is roughly  three – four per cent.“Assuming everyone who doesn’t die recovers, then the recovery rate can’t be more than 96 or 97 per cent,” Professor Marks told AAP FactCheck.“But the other part to this is there is increasing evidence some people who have had COVID  have persistent symptoms and persisting abnormalities, and as yet we don’t know how long that will last.“For many diseases there are long term consequences which mean that not having died is not the same as recovering.”AAP FactCheck has previously examined claims that COVID-19 has a 99.9 per cent or higher “survival rate” and also found them false.Professor Marks said the claim about the vaccine adverse reaction rate of 80 per cent was false.There are no vaccines for which 80 per cent of people get adverse effects that I am aware of in use,” he said.The only identified source of the claim that five people died from a vaccine trial is an unsubstantiated story that appears on a low-profile news website in the Lugansk People’s Republic, a pro-Russian independent state in Ukraine.News site Lugansk Media Centre published this article on July 17 claiming that five people, including four Ukranian Army members, died after being exposed to “the vaccine and medication produced by Americal (sic) virologists in the Kharkov region”.The story does not mention Moderna or provide details of the purported trial.The Lugansk Media Centre website was established in 2014 and does not specify who is writing for it. There are no Ukraine-based trials listed among vaccine research currently taking place around the world.The Ukrainian English language newspaper Kyiv Post reported in June that “Ukraine currently isn’t part of any vaccine projects, nor is it testing potential vaccines on humans”. The Moderna vaccine is still undergoing trials and no vaccine for COVID-19 has been produced yet.","http://archive.vn/osjVf ,https://www.modernatx.com/,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/ ,https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/covid-19-vaccine-race ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/27/moderna-nih-launch-30000-person-trial-coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483,https://www.hhs.gov/,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/experimental-covid-19-vaccine-safe-generates-immune-response,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-publication-new-england-journal-medicine,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427,https://med.unsw.edu.au/our-people/guy-marks,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality,https://www.aap.com.au/survival-rates-claim-isnt-part-of-the-covid-19-equation/,http://archive.today/5fo1x,https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/covid-19-vaccine-race,http://archive.today/pWnYG",Misinformation and fake “predicament” in claims about COVID-19 and a vaccine that isn’t available,,,,,,

Trust Stamp – Bill Gates funded program that will link your identity to your vaccination history”.The July 21 post has generated more than 500 shares and more than 35,000 views. A post claims Bill Gates has teamed up with digital identity firms to implant microchips in humans. The AnalysisThe post’s claim that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded two digital identity companies to develop programs to monitor humans is not true. Trust Stamp and COVI-PASS do not have partnerships with the Gates Foundation, nor have they developed microchip implants to track people using a ‘social credit system’.The post’s image appears to come from a July 19 article that appears on a website called GreatGameIndia. Trust Stamp is a global provider of identity proofing services aimed at preventing ID fraud and data loss. Some claims about Trust Stamp in the post are also similar to claims in the article.The Great Game India article includes the sentence: “Those who may not wish to be vaccinated may be locked out of the system based on their trust score”.The July 21 Facebook post has the passage: “The “trust” part of the Trust Stamp name comes from the fact that if you are not vaccinated, you will be locked out of the system based on your “trust” score.” Both the article and the post refer to Trust Stamp being part of a system of “predictive policing”.A Trust Stamp spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email the company was not in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.“Trust Stamp has never developed microchip technology meant to be implanted in humans,” the spokesperson said in response to the claim it uses microchips to monitor users.“Our only current involvement with vaccination initiatives is a result of our efforts to increase accessibility to markets, services and aid, through providing a means to prove identity for people that lack verifiable identity credentials (e.g a birth certificate).”“The vaccination program captures the parents’ biometrics, not those of the child, and there is no central storage of the biometrics or any other identity data. The biometric hash is stored on the device and on a card that the parent takes with them.”Regarding claims that Trust Stamp monitors financial accounts and is running a “social credit system”, the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the company did not have “any solutions that link healthcare records with access to financial tools”.“The work we do for financial inclusion aims to establish the first source of verifiable identity for those that have none. We do not store data relating to how an individual makes use of these services nor do we have or use any kind of ‘social credit system’.”The post also makes several claims about COVI-PASS, an app-based digital health wallet that allows people to store COVID-19 test results.The post claims COVI-PASS arose from the ID2020 project.ID2020 is a not-for-profit program that is funded by corporate sponsors including Microsoft and the Gates Foundation vaccine project Gavi.A COVI-PASS spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email the company did not have a funding partnership with the Gates Foundation, nor had it developed “implantable microchips” for humans.The spokesperson said COVI-PASS was not developed out of the ID2020 project.“COVI-PASS is simply a digital wallet that is being developed with health credentials in mind,” the spokesperson said.“A COVID-19 test result can only be accessed with the wallet holder’s permission.”The spokesperson said COVI-PASS uses blockchain, military-grade encryption and double authorisation to assure user data protection and is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant.”Claims Mr Gates planned to launch microchip implants have previously been debunked by AAP FactCheck following a March 2020 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” Q&A in which he mentioned foreseeing the use of “digital certificates” to show who has been tested for COVID-19.In June 2020, the Microsoft founder told Wired magazine that he had never been “involved in any sort of microchip-type thing”.“It is good to know which kids have had a measles vaccine and which have not, so there are data systems and … health records that people use to track that … but there’s no chips or anything like that,” he said.“It’s almost hard to deny this stuff because it’s so stupid or strange, that to even to repeat almost seems to give it credibility.” A claim the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded programs to monitor humans is not true.","http://archive.is/fjLNU,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are,https://greatgameindia.com/bill-gates-vaccination-based-digital-identity/,https://truststamp.ai/OurMission.html,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/12/2031912/0/en/Trust-Stamp-Enters-Insurtech-Space-with-100-000-Investment-from-OnRamp-Accelerator.html,https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/trust-stamp-secures-over-1m-funding-from-general-public-within-two-days,https://covipass.com/,https://covipass.com/faq/,https://id2020.org/faq,https://id2020.org/alliance,https://www.gavi.org/operating-model/gavis-partnership-model/bill-melinda-gates-foundation,https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/australian-entities-and-the-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20General%20Data,apply%20from%2025%20May%202018.&text=The%20GDPR%20and%20the%20Australian,by%20design%20approach%20to%20compliance,https://www.aap.com.au/bill-gates-wasnt-in-new-zealand-this-year-and-those-microchip-claims-have-already-been-debunked/,http://archive.today/f0rrw,http://archive.vn/hONRE","No, Bill Gates isn’t partnering with ID companies to implant microchips in humans",,,,,,
161,,,,False –,,2020-07-29,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/claim-that-cow-caused-methane-doesnt-raise-emissions-is-just-hot-air/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claims that methane produced by cows doesn’t increase greenhouse gas emissions because the methane is part of a cycle in which it is absorbed back into plants which are then eaten by the cows.The post features a meme depicting a “10-year natural cycle” of methane proceeding from the gas being emitted by cows to methane-absorbing plants being eaten by cows.Alongside the methane “cycle” is an illustration of a truck with red arrows pointing upwards in a depiction of carbon dioxide emissions. The diagram includes the words: “Remains in the atmosphere 1000 years”.Below the diagrams, overlaid on a photo of grazing cattle, are words “#CattleTales – Cattle don’t increase emissions, they recycle it into protein”. Other examples of the post have been shared here and here, with the same claim made in a different post from 2019 here.The post has been shared more than 210 times and has been viewed more than 69,000 times since July 16, 2020. A graphic circulating on social media depicts an inaccurate “cycle” for cattle-sourced methane. The AnalysisIt is not correct to claim that cows do not increase greenhouse gas emissions. Research in Australia and overseas cite livestock-sourced methane as a significant component of human-produced greenhouse gases. In addition, the methane from burping cattle is not neutralised by plant absorption and the post omits any mention of how methane impacts global warming.Methane is a potent greenhouse gas – much more so than carbon dioxide on a kilogram-for-kilogram basis.The claim that all carbon dioxide from vehicles remains in the air for 1000 years is incorrect. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that about 25 per cent of CO2 released into the atmosphere is absorbed by land plants and trees, another 25 per cent by oceans and about half can stay in the air. NASA says CO2 remains in the atmosphere for between 300 and 1,000 years.The Facebook post was originally shared on January 6 and again on July 16 by Cattle Tales, a US-based account dedicated to the dairy and cattle industry.The peer-reviewed report Global Methane Budget 2000 – 2017 provides an update of global methane sources in the atmosphere by an international research team as part of the Global Carbon Project.The report found atmospheric emissions and concentrations of global methane continue to increase “making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide.” CH4 is the chemical formula for methane.Melbourne University professor and Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre director Richard Eckard told AAP FactCheck the meme in the post presented a “very misleading diagram”.“It is true that methane is a short-lived climate pollutant….but what’s missing from this diagram is that while methane is in the atmosphere it is having a very large warming affect,” Prof Eckard told AAP FactCheck.“It’s a common thing that is pushed by the grazing industries in particular, saying methane doesn’t hang around long so it’s not a problem.“Because it has almost 100 times more warming effect than CO2, the extra heat that it creates will be warming us in 1000 years time.”Prof Eckard said that extra heat is stored in oceans “so while the gas may be gone the warming effect continues”.A 2020 CSIRO study found methane levels in the atmosphere are rising dangerously. The study noted methane stays in the air for about nine years but has a warming potential about 86 times higher than that of carbon dioxide over 20 years.Both the CSIRO study and a report published in Animal Frontiers, the journal of animal science societies in the US, Canada and Europe, concluded animal emissions are a significant factor in rising global methane emissions.The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation says total livestock emissions account for 14.5 per cent of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions, with methane making up 44 per cent of total livestock emissions.The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states “methane emissions result from livestock and other agricultural practices”.Prof Eckart says it is wrong to say plants absorb methane but that large areas of dry soil, such as in outback Australia, can act as a sink for the greenhouse gas. Methane produced by cattle does contribute to emissions and warming, research shows.","http://archive.vn/N3UTs,https://www.facebook.com/cattletales/photos/a.413776842371529/870613623354513,https://archive.vn/xh0W6,https://archive.vn/ldhGL,https://archive.vn/SjurH,https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases,https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/#:~:text=Notable%20Features-,When%20carbon%20dioxide%20CO2%20is%20released%20into%20the%20atmosphere,certain%20areas%20of%20the%20ocean.,https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/,https://www.facebook.com/cattletales/?ref=page_internal,https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/,https://www.icos-cp.eu/GCP-CH4/2019,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/2680-richard-eckard,https://blog.csiro.au/emissions-of-methane-are-rising/,https://academic.oup.com/af/article/9/1/69/5173494,http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/,https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#:~:text=Methane%20(CH4)%3A%20Methane,in%20municipal%20solid%20waste%20landfills.",Claim that cow-caused methane doesn’t raise emissions is just hot air,,,,,,

Doucette’s letter was also shared on the Massachusetts Republican Party Facebook page with a photo of Eastwood. Accompanying the image is a quote purportedly by the actor saying, “If Congress really gave a rat’s ass about the American people they would resign.”AAP FactCheck was unable to find any evidence to link Eastwood to the quote, although he has previously disparaged Congress, calling them “lazy bastards” in 2016 and in a 2013 interview he criticised Washington’s legislators by saying “it’s almost like they don’t give a damn”.It’s appears Eastwood was linked to the letter after his image was used in Doucette’s Facebook post. There is no evidence to show Clint Eastwood wrote the letter attributed to him in the Facebook post.","http://archive.is/Yuwkp,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Clint-Eastwood,http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/8/newsid_2523000/2523371.stm,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-19121795,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/06/1,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a46893/double-trouble-clint-and-scott-eastwood/,https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/a-hollywood-legend-talks-politics/ar-BB10fCtD,https://www.mikebloomberg.com/,https://www.eagletribune.com/opinion/letters_to_the_editor/letter-don-t-be-brainwashed-by-what-the-democrats-tell-you/article_2dd1956b-09a9-5962-a112-92caf6a85b40.html,http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=377220,http://archive.is/lmDeo,http://archive.is/daJly,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a46893/double-trouble-clint-and-scott-eastwood/,https://www.cnbc.com/id/100445629,http://archive.is/daJly",Is Clint Eastwood really making Trump’s day with an endorsement?,,,,,,

164,,,,Somewhat False,,2020-07-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/new-zealand-near-top-of-pacific-rim-tax-table-but-hard-to-say-it-leads-the-pack/,,,factcheck_aap,,"AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is New Zealand the highest-taxed country in the Pacific Rim?The Statement“We are already the highest taxed country on the Pacific Rim. Not just higher taxed than Singapore, but higher than Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, the US, Vietnam.”David Seymour, ACT Party leader, June 12, 2020.The AnalysisAs the New Zealand government undertakes what’s been described as the single biggest spending package in the country’s history, public debt is forecast to reach record levels.Figures released by Treasury for this year’s budget in May show New Zealand’s net core Crown debt is forecast to reach $NZ200.8 billion by 2024 (Table 5), reaching 53.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The government said the debt was to fund a $50b package to assist the country’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However the scale of spending has sparked political debate about how the government will pay the debt down.When ACT Party leader David Seymour appeared on Q+A with Jack Tame on TVNZ1 on July 12, he said the government needed to reduce spending to pay back debt as New Zealand was already heavily taxed.“There are three options,” Mr Seymour said. “You either increase taxes, reduce spending or grow the economy faster.“We are already the highest-taxed country on the Pacific Rim. Not just higher taxed than Singapore, but higher than Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, the US, Vietnam. So you’ve got to start reducing expenditure.”AAP FactCheck examined Mr Seymour’s claim that New Zealand was the highest-taxed country in the Pacific Rim.When contacted about the statement, the Act Party referred AAP FactCheck to a 2019 report released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Develop (OECD), a forum of 37 developed countries. The annual Revenue Statistics in Asian and Pacific Economies report publishes comparable tax revenue figures for 17 countries in the region: Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Tokelau and Vanuatu.The report compares countries using a measure called a tax-to-GDP ratio, which expresses a country’s tax revenue as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product.Using figures from 2017, the report finds New Zealand had the highest tax-to-GDP ratio of the 17 countries analysed (page 3), with a ratio of 32.0 per cent. However, the report does not include figures for Canada and the United States, which Mr Seymour identified in his statement on Q+A.Another report, showing comprehensive tax revenue data from the OECD, shows that Canada’s tax-to-GDP ratio was slightly higher than New Zealand’s in both 2017 and 2018. Canada’s tax-to-GDP ratio for 2017 and 2018 was 32.81 and 32.99 per cent respectively, while New Zealand’s ratio was 32.08 per cent in 2017 and 32.69 per cent in 2018. The US’s figure was lower, at 26.78 per cent in 2017 and at 24.3 per cent in 2018.The Cambridge Dictionary defines the Pacific Rim as “the countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean such as Japan, Australia, and the west coast of the US”.AAP FactCheck was unable to find comparable data for China, Russia, Vietnam, North Korea and a number of smaller Pacific Island nations. International financial institutions the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  also collate tax-to-GDP ratio figures for a number of countries. The IMF has figures for 24 countries in the Pacific Rim for 2017 and shows New Zealand has the highest tax-to-GDP ratio of the countries, at 31.98 per cent. Canada is ranked second highest, with a ratio of 27.63 per cent. The World Bank lists New Zealand as having the third highest tax-to-GDP ratio in the Pacific Rim. Using 2019 figures, it puts New Zealand’s tax-to-GDP ratio at 29.0 per cent, behind that of Nauru (30.5 per cent) and the Solomon Islands (29.5 per cent). Canada’s tax-to-GDP ratio is listed as just 12.9 per cent.University of Otago senior economics lecturer and Treasury advisor Dr Andrew Coleman told AAP FactCheck via email that the OECD generally had the most comprehensive and comparable figures on tax revenue and was commonly cited in academic literature. However he said the data was not perfect due to differences in how countries define taxes and levies.AAP FactCheck asked the Act Party about the difference between tax rates according to the OECD and Mr Seymour’s statement. An Act Party spokesman said Mr Seymour was referring to the Asia-Pacific region and not the ‘Pacific Rim’ nations. This is at odds with Mr Seymour’s statement on Q+A, which specifically named Canada, the United States and the Pacific Rim.So does New Zealand pay more tax than any country in the Asia-Pacific? It depends on how the Asia-Pacific is defined.AAP FactCheck was unable to find a clear and consistent definition of the region. Different organisations include different countries when referring to the Asia-Pacific. The OECD uses different sets of countries in its reports on the region –  typically it does not include countries in the Americas but sometimes does not include New Zealand and Australia either.Other international institutions also use quite different definitions.The United Nations includes a regional group called the Asia-Pacific Group, however this does not include New Zealand or Australia, which are in the “Western European and Others Group”. The UN’s Economic and Social Commission for the Asia Pacific does include the two countries but not the Americas. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC), a regional economic forum, has 21 members, including Canada and other countries in the Americas. The World Bank groups 36 countries into an East Asia and the Pacific region, which includes Pacific Islands and South East Asian countries, but not the Americas. Under this definition, New Zealand may have the highest tax-to-GDP ratio, based on OECD figures. The tax take, as a percentage of GDP, in New Zealand is high but not the highest in the Pacific Rim.","https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-national/budget-glance-50-billion-plan,https://budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/wellbeing/fiscal-strategy/strong-fiscal-position.htm,https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/budget-speech/budget-speech-2020-html,https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/q-and-a/clips/act-party-leader-says-there-needs-to-be-a-policy-debate-about-how-to-reduce-debt-burden-on-younger-generations,https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-asia-pacific-brochure.pdf,https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-revenue.htm,https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pacific-rim,https://www.worldbank.org/,https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm,https://data.imf.org/?sk=77413F1D-1525-450A-A23A-47AEED40FE78&sId=1390030341854,https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true,https://www.otago.ac.nz/economics/staff/otago077824.html,https://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/RegionalGroups.shtml,https://www.unescap.org/about/member-states,https://www.apec.org/,https://data.worldbank.org/region/east-asia-and-pacific",New Zealand near top of Pacific Rim tax table but hard to say it leads the pack,,,,,,

Among the attributed quotes is the following: “PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for viral sequences, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome. The problem is the test is known not to work”.Another attributed quote is: “the idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense”.The video has been viewed more than 3,100 times and attracted more than 120 comments since it was posted on July 18, 2020.Similar claims about PCR testing have appeared online including here, here and here. A Facebook video claims the PCR test inventor said the tests do not effectively diagnose COVID-19. The AnalysisThe quotes attributed to PCR test inventor Dr Kary B. Mullis are not from the Nobel Prize-winning American biochemist. The quotes have appeared online with various attributions online since March, 2020. Dr Mullis died in August, 2019, before the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic.The earliest example of the quoted lines found by AAP FactCheck is an entry published between March 13 and March 18, according to internet archive Wayback Machine, on a website that claims terrorist attacks such as 9/11 were staged. The lines on the website, copied below, are identical to the purported quotes read out in the video except for one omitted paragraph, shown in bold. They are not attributed to Dr Mullis but to an online commenter called “VirusGuy”:“PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences’, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.The problem is the test is known not to work.It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.Additionally, it’s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.(Omitted: The Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus – say the huge family of coronavirus. But that’s all.)The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.”The page contents also appear, copied and pasted, in this Facebook post dated March 17, 2020.In addition to the original comments coming from an anonymous online commenter, Dr Mullis died, aged 74, in August 2019, four months before the first signs of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and six months before the World Health Organisation named the disease COVID-19, making it impossible for the late doctor to have spoken about COVID-19.The same “quotes” have appeared elsewhere online, including on this site, presented as being from “a widely respected professional scientist in the US” on a medical forum.Dr Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for his invention of  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a laboratory method used to make a large number of copies of short sections of DNA from a very small sample of genetic material, enabling specific genes of interest to be detected or measured.PCR testing is one of the two main tests used to detect a COVID-19 infection in Australia and has been approved by the government’s Therapeutic Goods Administration.Dr Ian Mackay, a virologist and adjunct associate professor with the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck the claims read out about PCR testing in the video show “an extreme lack of understanding of PCR, PCR test design and use”.One of the claims is that the process of DNA amplification, which grows a tiny amount of DNA exponentially, can also amplify contaminants leading to “potentially gross errors of discovery”.Dr Mackay said laboratories have processes in place to account for and prevent PCR contamination, including having controls to alert them if contamination has occurred.In response to the claim “the tests do not work”, Prof Mackay said the tests are “extremely effective at very sensitively and specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2”.“The leading tests have also been tested on SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected patients, isolated and grown in cells in the lab – so we know it is this virus that we’re detecting,” he said.“The tests detect the viral sequences we expect them to and not other viruses.”Regarding the claim in the video that it is “next to impossible” for PCR testing to identify a single pathogen because it only looks for partial viral sequences and not the whole COVID-19 sequence, Professor Mackay said PCR tests are in fact designed to look at partial viral sequences.“That is by design, not an error or an oversight. We have only been able to quickly and relatively easily (compared to even a decade ago) detect entire viral genomes – the science of genomics – in very recent times. It is still costly, less sensitive and slower to determine the entire sequence of a virus compared to detecting its presence using a PCR test. And for cluster, outbreak, epidemic and pandemic control and for patient management – detection the virus (which real-time PCRs do) is all that is needed,” he said. A claim that the inventor of PCR tests said the tests don’t work in detecting COVID-19 is false.","http://archive.today/fxkon,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/coronavirus-melbourne-conspiracy-group-tells-people-to-reject-tests-and-masks/news-story/bf4879966aa5af8fd1552687149abe88,http://archive.is/h6Zcr,http://archive.vn/s9oZW,http://archive.is/QqrME ,https://www.karymullis.com/index.shtml,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/science/kary-b-mullis-dead.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20200318060118/https://occamsrazorterrorevents.weebly.com/blog/coronavirus-hoax-jan-2020,http://archive.is/BKeLv,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/science/kary-b-mullis-dead.html,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-2019-ncov-on-11-february-2020,http://archive.today/LDiXB,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1993/mullis/facts/,https://www.labtestsonline.org.au/inside-the-lab/laboratory-methods/pcr-(1),https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-testing-australia-information-health-professionals,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/4428",PCR inventor – who died in 2019 – did not say his test won’t work for COVID-19 infections,,,,,,

The quote in the post has been selectively edited to omit the following line which states: “the contamination did not spread the virus to people”.After news broke in January about a new coronavirus emerging in China, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hurriedly sent a batch of testing kits to public health laboratories in America.Those kits were subsequently found to be faulty during testing done before they were put into use. Tests found that they returned false positive results. A June report into the bungled process, produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the General Counsel and published by the Washington Post, found “one of the three reagents in this initial batch of manufactured test kits was likely contaminated.US news outlets reported on the federal review findings, saying “sloppy laboratory practices“and “time pressures” led to a batch of contaminated tests being sent to nearly all of the 100 state and local public health labs.An audit into CDC’s processes has since been announced, to be handed down in 2021.The Instagram post in question shows a partial quote from this article about the test failures on technology website Ars Technica. What is omitted from the quote is the following line which reads: “The contamination did not spread the virus to people, but it made test results uninterpretable”.While the incident slowed US testing in the early stages of the pandemic, the OGC investigation concluded there was no evidence of false coronavirus test results on patients.“They could not validate the test—a negative control gave a positive result—and thus, the test kits were not used and no patient received an inaccurate test result,” the report stated.After CDC scientists discovered the error in early February with a particular substance in the testing batch, the https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/5610e9fa-86d7-4bd3-8b7a-f8df10c6fc9e/note/7331ef79-a672-4d2d-9eff-f8ce39c2e462.#page=1 “>problem was resolved later in the month and all tests were pulled from the affected laboratories. The suggestion that the tests may be in circulation ignores the fact the tainted test kits were no longer used.The claim about the tests, which has been circulated in other forms such as here and here, has also been examined and found false by fact-checkers Politifact and Reuters.This particular version has an Australian angle, claiming some governments are “incentivising testing of healthy people—as in Australia where $1500 has been offered to people to stay home if they get tested positive”. This is inaccurate. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced in June that a $1,500 payment would be offered to Victorian workers required to self-isolate or quarantine because of a positive COVID-19 test or close contact.The payment is only available to Victorian residents who are unable to work because of a health directive to self-isolate or go into quarantine, and who are unable to access other forms of income. A claim that COVID-19 test kits in circulation are contaminated with virus is not true.","http://archive.vn/7fuHx,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/testing.html,https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/ogc/index.html#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20the%20General,of%20highly%20visible%20national%20issues.,https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/5610e9fa-86d7-4bd3-8b7a-f8df10c6fc9e/note/7331ef79-a672-4d2d-9eff-f8ce39c2e462.#page=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/cdc-coronavirus-test-kits-were-likely-contaminated-federal-review-confirms/2020/06/20/1ceb4e16-b2ef-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html,https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000462.asp,http://archive.today/QGMn0,https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/5610e9fa-86d7-4bd3-8b7a-f8df10c6fc9e/note/7331ef79-a672-4d2d-9eff-f8ce39c2e462.#page=1, <a href=,http://archive.today/0ZUYT,http://archive.today/2KKsP,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/08/facebook-posts/batch-faulty-cdc-covid-19-tests-didnt-contain-live/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-contaminated-covid-tests/fact-check-contaminated-cdc-covid-19-test-kits-recalled-and-did-not-spread-virus-idUSKCN24F214,https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/statement-from-the-premier-45/,https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/covid-19-worker-support-payment",Claim that “COVID-19 test has the virus” misleads on an early US kit fault that was found and fixed,,,,,,

COVID starts with a C, which also means ‘see’ in ancient language. 19 was known as the “Number of Surrender” in ancient times.”  It goes on to draw the conclusion, “C-OVID 19 = ‘See a Sheep Surrender'”. The June 20 post has been shared more than 160 times and is one of multiple examples found here, here and here. A Facebook post makes several claims about the etymology of COVID-19. The AnalysisWhat’s in a name? Plenty it seems as social media users continue to promote unusual claims about COVID-19 including the assertion that the name of the coronavirus is partly derived from Latin.In addressing the Facebook post’s linguistic claims, AAP FactCheck sought the opinion of Associate Professor Marcus John Wilson of University of Auckland’s Classics and Ancient History faculty.Dr Wilson told AAP FactCheck the post’s claims about COVID-19’s supposed linguistic origins were “complete nonsense”. “Ovis in Latin is the word for a sheep,” he said. “There is no word ‘ovid’ in Latin except as a personal name (of the famous poet)”. The Roman poet Ovid is best known for Metamorphoses, a 15-book poem which reworked stories from Greek mythology.Dr Wilson said C did not mean ‘see’ in “any language (except maybe texting abbreviations).” As for the supposed significance of the number 19 in “ancient times”? “I can’t speak for them all, but I don’t know of anywhere 19 has this kind of mysterious meaning,” Dr Wilson told AAP FactCheck. “Certainly not in Roman or other Latin speaking cultures.”The Encyclopedia Britannica’s entry on number symbolism notes that eclipses of the Sun occur every 19 years and the number was considered unlucky in ancient Babylon.The name “COVID-19” was decided on by the World Health Organization after the new viral strain was named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The ICTV named the coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), on February 11, 2020. World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained the naming of COVID-19 at a press conference on the same date (5m58s): “CO,’ C-O, stands for ‘corona,’ V-I stands for ‘virus,’ ‘D’ for ‘disease,’ so ‘COVID.'”WHO says the virus was previously known as “2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV”. A Facebook post claims the name “COVID-19” is an acronym for ‘See a Sheep Surrender’.","http://archive.is/fniaN,http://archive.is/kLrHf/image,http://archive.is/NFeWj,http://archive.is/jG1ds,https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/people/profile/mj-wilson,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Ovis,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ovid-Roman-poet,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Metamorphoses-poem-by-Ovid,https://www.britannica.com/topic/number-symbolism/13#ref248176,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-2019-ncov-on-11-february-2020,https://talk.ictvonline.org/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632,https://twitter.com/DrTedros,https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227246758196998145,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it","The name “COVID-19” has nothing to do with sheep, Latin or surrendering",,,,,,

Vaccines that the govt forced them to take did and they are repeating the same pattern now.” It ends with the claim, “50 million dead from 1918 flu vaccine”.The July 12 post has attracted more than 17,000 views and more than 300 shares. A Facebook post highlights the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic to warn of the ill effects of vaccines. The AnalysisThe Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 was the most severe pandemic in recent history, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With “genes of avian origin”, the virus infected an estimated 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population and killed around 50 million people.Mortality from the pandemic was high in children under five and people aged between 20-40 and 65 and older. Efforts to control the spread were limited to isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings.In 1918, Smallpox, Rabies, Typhoid, Cholera and Plague were the only vaccine-preventable diseases, according to a CDC report (see table 1).  Influenza was first established as being caused by a virus in the 1930s and the first flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s in the US.Dr Peter Hubbins, a medical historian and expert on the history of the Spanish Flu in Australia, said there were several vaccines created in Australia and overseas to protect against the Spanish Flu using bacteria drawn from the lungs of people infected.“The fundamental problem with all 1918-19 vaccines is that they were developed against bacteria. Therefore the vaccines were technically created against the ‘wrong’ organism and theoretically had no protective value,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email.Dr Hubbins said many victims also suffered from secondary bacterial infections and it was possible bacterial-based vaccines potentially reduced the severity and mortality of the Spanish Flu among those who were vaccinated.“Vaccines in those days were rather crude and people may have felt unwell after receiving them, but it is completely wrong to suggest that there would have been 50 million deaths worldwide due to their use,” he said.Variations of the post have been in circulation since at least 2009 and have previously been debunked here and here. The flu vaccine was developed in the 1940s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","http://archive.is/hEN8E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291398/,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056803.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pandemic-timeline-1930-and-beyond.htm#:~:text=1940s%3A%20Thomas%20Francis%2C%20Jr.,produce%20most%20flu%20vaccines%20today,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pandemic-timeline-1930-and-beyond.htm#:~:text=1940s%3A%20Thomas%20Francis%2C%20Jr.,produce%20most%20flu%20vaccines%20today,https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/peter-hobbins.html,https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/05/27/2020-versus-1919--is-covid-19-as-bad-as-the--spanish--flu-.html,https://tineye.com/search/d4b90a0cec9cc5f23ecdbaeccbbfd5df537c43b4?sort=crawl_date&order=asc&page=1,https://facta.news/notizia-falsa/2020/06/29/no-la-seconda-ondata-dellinfluenza-spagnola-nel-1918-non-fu-provocata-dai-vaccini/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-vaccines-caused-1918-influe/false-claim-the-1918-influenza-pandemic-was-caused-by-vaccines-idUSKBN21J6X2",Flu vaccine did not kill 50 million during the 1918 Spanish Flu,,,,,,
169,,,,Partly False –,,2020-07-16,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/coronavirus-does-not-just-equal-the-common-cold/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA widely-shared Facebook post features a medical text from 1989 and claims that coronaviruses equal the common cold.The post is titled, “From the AMA encyclopedia of disease published 1989, page 1051. Corona is a cold” and shows an excerpt from the American Medical Association Encyclopedia. Under a heading “Types of Virus”, the page shows depictions of different diseases and lists the virus family with examples of related symptoms. Among the viruses listed is “Coronaviruses” and written next to it in the conditions column is “Common Cold.”The post includes the comment, “American Medical Association Encyclopedia, published 1989. Coronaviruses = common cold. Print off and put in EVERY police station letterbox or post with words, ‘Jail Politicians’ written on the back’.”The July 10 post has attracted 1.1 million views and more than 520 shares. A Facebook post features a medical text from 1989 to claim that coronaviruses equal the common cold. The AnalysisThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses linked to the SARS and MERS respiratory infections and some types of common cold, according to the World Health Organization.WHO lists common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, and tiredness but can also  “range from no symptoms… to severe pneumonia or death”.The US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lists symptoms of the common cold to include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches. The CDC also says many different respiratory viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common.The CDC also states on its website that the “virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.”Viral infectious diseases expert Professor Damian Purcell from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, says coronaviruses do cause common colds, but to circulate such a statement as contained in the Facebook post during a coronavirus pandemic is misleading.“It’s quite important when talking about this particular strain of virus, not to call it a coronavirus or coronaviruses,” Prof Purcell told AAP FactCheck“It should be called SARS CoV 2, and the name means severe acute respiratory syndrome. Strictly speaking the American Medical Association in 1989 were completely correct in saying coronaviruses cause the common cold, but it’s absolutely misleading to say that about SARS Covid 2.“It’s the difference between saying something is seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza which killed millions of people.”Prof Purcell said while the AMA’s “sweeping statement” was true of its time, it’s important to note that it was made before the SARS epidemic (2002-2003).“Before this coronaviruses were only associated with the common cold,” he said. The CDC says different viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common.","http://archive.is/PInuZ,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_1.pdf,https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov),https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/about/default.htm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3553670/,https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cdcresponse/about-COVID-19.html,https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-damian-purcell,https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/",Coronavirus does not just equal the common cold,,,,,,

The Facebook post by NZ page 5G Free Hamilton Kirikiriroa features a July 3 blog post to highlight a definition of ‘microwave sickness’.The 5G Crisis – ‘A Project of Americans for Responsible Technology’ blog post reads, “Microwave sickness has now been formally added to the Merriam Webster dictionary,” and links to the noun ‘microwave sickness’ in the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary.To examine whether ‘microwave sickness’ was recently added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, AAP FactCheck conducted an internet archive search of the entry’s web address and found it dated back to at least 2009.Merriam-Webster editor-at-large and lexicgrapher Peter Sokolowski told AAP FactCheck in an email that ‘microwave sickness’ was included in the first printing of the Medical Dictionary in 1986.Mr Sokolowski explained that Merriam-Webster dictionaries were not open-source publications.“Merriam-Webster is the oldest and best-selling reference publisher in the United States,” he AAP FactCheck. “Our books are professionally edited and researched, going back to Noah Webster’s first dictionary in 1806.”Regarding Merriam Webster’s lexicography, he referred AAP FactCheck to the article “How does a word get into a Merriam-Webster dictionary?” on its website.“To decide which words to include in the dictionary and to determine what they mean, Merriam-Webster editors study the language as it’s used,” the article says. “They carefully monitor which words people use most often and how they use them.”The article also goes on to detail how a word progresses from a citation to a dictionary entry. “To be included in a Merriam-Webster dictionary, a word must be used in a substantial number of citations that come from a wide range of publications over a considerable period of time. Specifically, the word must have enough citations to allow accurate judgments about its establishment, currency, and meaning.” The term ‘microwave sickness’ was first included by the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1986.","http://archive.is/5JYBb,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408142/anti-5g-protestors-rally-in-christchurch-as-roll-out-continues,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northland-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503402&objectid=12307534,https://www.facebook.com/pg/5G-Free-Hamilton-Kirikiriroa-103917444486728/about/,https://www.5gcrisis.com/post/merriam-webster-adds-microwave-sickness-to-the-dictionary?fbclid=IwAR3e7OvKRboYb7AZtM-AFinlLGBLlAVTmZEDUd9qFwmRw8VTuidZasWnfto,https://web.archive.org/web/20090101000000*/https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/microwave%20sickness,https://twitter.com/petersokolowski?lang=en,https://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq-words-into-dictionary",‘Microwave sickness’ has not just been added to the dictionary,,,,,,

Other examples have also been shared multiple times, including here and here. A post takes issue with the lack of medical qualifications of people advising on economic matters. The AnalysisThe claims in the post about the medical qualifications of members of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) ignore the key point that the NCCC was not set up to advise on medical matters. That work is done by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).The NCCC, made up of business, labour and policy experts was established to advise on recovery from the huge economic and social impacts of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on Australia.Australia began its COVID-19 response on February 13, 2020, by restricting the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled in mainland China. A month later COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation and on March 19 Australia closed its borders.Following months of lockdowns and business closures, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed on June 2 that Australia’s economy was in recession for the first time in 29 years.The NCCC was established by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on March 25, 2020 to advise the new National Cabinet on actions to “anticipate and mitigate the economic and social effects of the global coronavirus pandemic”.NCCC Chair Neville Power, who was once the CEO of iron ore giant Fortescue Metals, said the role of the commission was to “minimise and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on our businesses, our communities and our people.” The NCCC’s Terms of Reference page states the committee will advise the Prime Minister on “all non-health aspects of the pandemic response” while “working in tandem with the Chief Medical Officer”. The Terms of Reference also state: “The CMO (Chief Medical Officer) and the medical expert panel he leads – the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) – will continue their role of advising the National Cabinet on Australia’s health management and response to the virus.”The AHPPC comprises the CMO and all state and territory Chief Health Officers.A spokesperson for the NCCC told AAP FactCheck in an email that the commission was set up to coordinate economic and social advice to the Australian Government.“It was never set up to provide medical or health advice. There is a dedicated expert medical group providing comprehensive health advice to National Cabinet,” the spokesperson said. A post takes issue with the makeup of the body advising governments on COVID-19’s economic impacts.","http://archive.vn/g8Rx6,http://archive.is/wEiUS,http://archive.is/oR0pe,https://www.pmc.gov.au/nccc,http://archive.today/7xbIA,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/border-restrictions,http://archive.today/nCjKY,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/national-covid-19-coordination-commission,https://www.pmc.gov.au/news-centre/government/coag-becomes-national-cabinet,http://archive.today/chwqY,http://archive.today/pxovD,https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc",Misleading claim about COVID Commission ignores why the advisory body was set up,,,,,,

Text below states the picture was taken in World War II.“What’s happening is that the field is mined and that if the donkey was free to wonder (sic) as it pleased, it would likely detonate a charge and kill everyone,” the text says.It continues: “the moral of the story is that during difficult times the first ones you have to keep under control are the jackasses who don’t understand the danger and do as they please.”There are other examples of the post shared in Australia, including here, here and here, with total shares coming to more than 1,200 and views to more than 1.2 million. A Facebook post features a well-documented photo of a soldier giving a piggyback ride to a donkey. The AnalysisThe claimed “moral of the story” in the post is a message about controlling dangerous behaviour that may threaten others and is not the subject of this fact check. However the photograph does not depict the situation described. The story behind the photograph of the soldier carrying the donkey is well-documented. It was taken not during World War II but rather in Algeria, in 1958 during the Algerian War of Independence. The conflict was waged against French colonial rule 13 years after World War II ended, and resulted in the formation of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria in 1962.The photograph featured on the UK Daily Mirror newspaper’s front page on Friday 19 September in 1958. The accompanying article says a French Foreign Legionnaire who had a “tender heart” rescued the starving young donkey from the “sun-baked Algerian valley”.The rescued donkey was named Bambi by the troops of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion in 1958, according to Foreign Legion Info, a site dedicated to documenting the history of this unit of the French Army. Britain’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sent a letter to the legion for their troops’ “demonstration of humanity.”The real story behind the photo of the piggy-backed donkey has also been examined by fact checkers at Snopes and Fake History Hunter. Snopes refers to a passage by Douglas Porch in his 1991 book “The French Foreign Legion: A Complete History of the Legendary Fighting Force,” that says the donkey was nurtured back to health by the soldiers, who made it their unit’s mascot. A Facebook post claiming a photo shows a donkey being carried through a WWII minefield is wrong.","http://archive.today/QBJTl,http://archive.today/Yud4K,http://archive.today/6tf9K,http://archive.today/c0bPa,https://www.britannica.com/event/Algerian-War,https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19580919/004/0001,http://foreignlegion.info/history/13dble/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/soldier-carrying-donkey/,https://fakehistoryhunter.wordpress.com/2020/04/04/not-a-donkey-being-carried-across-a-minefield/",Explosive COVID-19 safety tale can’t be pinned on piggybacked donkey pic,,,,,,

Websites such as commodity.com keep an aggregated running tally on global debt as well as each nation’s public debt. However, it does so with a disclaimer: “While we do our best to present accurate data, we offer no guarantees or warranties that the data we present is necessarily accurate”.For its New Zealand national debt counter, World Debt Clocks states the data is sourced from NZ Treasury.NZ Treasury’s interim financial statement for the 10 months to the end of April showed NZ’s gross sovereign-issued debt was $120,323 million (page 15). The Facebook post on July 1 puts NZ’s national debt at $120,153 million ($120.1 billion).A spokesman for NZ Treasury, Bryan McDaniel, told AAP FactCheck by email that while the figure of $120 billion was accurate to the end of April, Treasury has forecast $134,229 million ($134.2 billion) of gross sovereign-issued debt as at June 30.“This is as per Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020,” Mr McDaniel said. The update was published on May 14, 2020 (page 107).Gross sovereign debt “represents debt issued by the sovereign (the Core Crown) and includes government stock held by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZS Fund), ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) and EQC (Earthquake Commission),” according to the NZ Treasury update  (page 134). The Core Crown (page 132) refers to a reporting segment that includes government departments and ministries, parliament offices, NZ Reserve Bank, and the NZS Fund.At the bottom of the World Debt Clocks website it says that data is “collected from official government agencies and central banks or Eurostat” but offers no further information on how that data is mined.

Accompanying those are claims that the expanded network may cause negative health effects in people.A post shared to The People say NO to 5G!’s Facebook group reads: “big data and big telecom may be rushing to install 5G near your home” during the COVID-19 lockdowns.It then lists a series of symptoms and diseases under the headings “what you may feel”, “now” and “later”, implying a connection to 5G technology. Symptoms under “now” include “headaches, heart palpitations, tingling, tinnitus, shortness of breath”, and conditions under “later” include “tumors (sic), cancers, DNA damage, cell damage and degenerative brain injury”.The caption accompanying the post reads, “As 5G rolls out around Australia, and the rest of the world, these are some symptoms you may be feeling, not associating it wireless (sic) radiation. Symptoms we would be inclined to think are stress, fear, age, cold’s, flu and even coronavirus-like symptoms…”It claims, “These basic symptoms can be the start of radiation sickness and can develop/be a contributing factor into known conditions of today.”The post has been shared more than 300 times and viewed more than 16,000 times since it was posted on June 28. A Facebook post makes a number of unsupported claims about 5G technology and illness. The AnalysisThe post’s first claim is that “big telcos” and “big data” may be rushing to install 5G during the lockdown.In Australia, three vendors currently offer 5G networks: Telstra, Optus and Vodafone.A Telstra spokesperson told AAP FactCheck by email that the company had been rolling out 5G in a number of cities and towns across the country since August 2018.“In February we announced that we had switched on 5G coverage in 32 cities and regional towns across Australia,” the spokesperson said.“Since then, we’ve switched on 5G coverage in another 15 cities and towns.“As with any new technology, a rollout picks up pace as more technology becomes available and our crews and contractors become more familiar with the building and construction work required.”Optus is understood to have built 284 5G sites across Australia between March and the end of June, however the rate of construction remained in line with the average because access restrictions resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns prevented any acceleration.According to Vodafone’s website, the company’s first 5G network was switched on in March 2020 in Parramatta, NSW, with more to be switched on from mid-2020 in other major cities.The second claim in the post lists the supposed health effects people could experience when exposed to 5G radiation.According to Professor Rodney Croft, an expert in the health impacts of mobile phone signals and other radio frequencies from the University of Wollongong, there is no link between the symptoms mentioned in the post and the radiation emitted by 5G devices.“Such claims are not new, and have tended to emerge following most new technological advances such as the introduction of microwave ovens, 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G technologies,” Prof Croft told AAP FactCheck.“There is no evidence at all that the radiation from these devices, at the very low levels that people are exposed to, can cause any adverse health effect.“As a result, if someone is suffering from any kind of ill health, it is crucial to seek medical advice rather than rely on other people’s claims that their problems will abate if they can avoid exposure to the radiation from 5G devices.”Associate Professor Sarah Loughran, director of the Australian Centre for Electromagnetic Bioeffects Research at the University of Wollongong, told AAP FactCheck there is no link between 5G radiation and negative health effects.Dr Loughran said, in an emailed response, that symptoms people claim to experience when they believe they are being exposed to 5G radiation are more closely associated with a “nocebo effect”, or the suggestion or belief that something has a particular effect.“In this particular case, it would correspond to a misaligned belief that the electromagnetic energy associated with 5G is harmful and, therefore, when around devices that emit such fields they expect to feel bad, and they do,” she said.The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) says there is “no established evidence that low-level radio wave exposure from 5G can affect the immune system or cause any other long term or short term health effects”.In January, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said there was no evidence that technologies such as 5G had adverse health impacts.AAP FactCheck has previously investigated and found false claims seeking to link 5G to illness or suggest that 5G hardware rollout has been accelerated during the COVID-19 lockdown. There have been a number of claims seeking to link 5G technology rollouts to COVID-19 lockdowns.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10223032947514972&set=gm.213862266369088&type=3&theater,https://www.canstarblue.com.au/internet/when-can-i-get-5g-in-australia/ ,https://www.vodafone.com.au/support/network/5g ,https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/rodney_croft,https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/sarah_loughran,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/about-us ,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-and-other-telecommunications-do-not-affect-immune-system,https://www.health.gov.au/news/safety-of-5g-technology,https://www.aap.com.au/dates-dont-line-up-when-comparing-disease-epidemics-and-new-mobile-technology-rollouts/,https://www.aap.com.au/phone-tower-put-up-overnight-in-covid-19-conspiracy-claim-has-been-there-at-least-seven-months/,https://www.aap.com.au/phone-antennas-outside-a-college-arent-a-new-addition-to-the-neighbourhood/",No evidence for 5G rollout rush or rush of symptoms,,,,,,

Carbon dioxide.. Caused an infection … But you wont (sic) see that on social media!”There are several examples of the post shared by Australian and New Zealand users found here and here. In total they have received more than 60,000 views and more than 840 shares.  A Facebook post claims that a grocery store worker who wore a mask for hours got a lung infection. The AnalysisSo can you actually get sick from breathing in your own air while wearing a face mask? The COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes, according to the World Health Organization. Airborne transmission differs from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, WHO says. Respiratory droplets are between five to 10 micrometers in size and carbon dioxide molecules – and molecules in general – are far smaller than droplets.Many papers have been written about the effectiveness of masks to prevent disease transmission. There are many different types of face coverings being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from home-made cloth coverings to medical-grade N95 filtered masks. Disposable surgical masks and cloth face masks are highly porous, allowing air to flow in and out while limiting the spread of droplets from coughing, sneezing and simply breathing. The Facebook post does not specify what kind of mask is referred to in the story.You can catch the lung infection pleurisy via a virus such as the flu or a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. However, if someone is exhaling viruses or bacteria, then they are already infected or “presymptomatic”, according to an article by science education website Health Feedback.The Facebook post also claims that carbon dioxide caused an infection. There have been claims that wearing masks can cause hypercapnia, a build-up of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. However, the World Health Organization says while the prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable it does “not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency”. “While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally,” WHO advises. To address the post, AAP FactCheck sought the opinion of two experts: Dunedin pathologist Dr Ling Chan and epidemiologist, Professor Michael Baker, who is a member of New Zealand’s Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group helping to co-ordinate the government’s response to the pandemic. Dr Chan, a co-author on a recent New Zealand Medical Journal report on the use of masks in infection control, told AAP FactCheck there was no evidence that mask wearing increases carbon dioxide intake. “The CO2 would pass through the gaps round the side and through the face covering as CO2 is much smaller than the fabric/mask materials,” she said.“Tens of thousands of dentists, and health care professionals plus now millions of people around the world mask up for hours on end without an increase in rates of pneumonia.”Prof Baker agreed that the claim did not “look plausible”.Fact checks by the BBC and Poynter Institute examining the safety of wearing masks reached similar conclusions. A representative for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters in May, “It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia.”  The CDC does advise that children under two, and anyone who has trouble breathing should not use cloth face coverings.  There are many different types of face coverings being used during the COVID-19 pandemic.","http://archive.is/dw9NZ,http://archive.is/ZUmmT,http://archive.is/E9Qty,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations,https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/03/30/2859247.htm,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLrm0pqBN_5bdyysOeoOBX4pt4oFDBhsC_jpblXpNtQ/edit#,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/testing-the-efficacy-of-homemade-masks-would-they-protect-in-an-influenza-pandemic/0921A05A69A9419C862FA2F35F819D55,https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks,http://www.hogy.co.jp/english/product/n95.html,https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/health-a-z/p/pleurisy/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/people-who-do-not-show-covid-19-symptoms-can-and-do-transmit-it-to-others-physical-distancing-and-face-masks-effectively-reduce-the-risk-of-transmission/?fbclid=IwAR0DXgltdzbkD6emx5xM7dLrhCSLlY285V3DsBflxik5NhyDqWSPiEkjqhY,https://www.bbc.com/news/53108405,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/hypercapnia-copd-related,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks,https://twitter.com/drlingchan,https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago024831.html,https://www.health.govt.nz/about-ministry/leadership-ministry/expert-groups/covid-19-technical-advisory-group,https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/mass-masking-an-alternative-to-a-second-lockdown-in-aotearoa,https://www.bbc.com/news/53108405,https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=wearing-a-face-mask-for-a-prolonged-period-of-time-causes-hypoxia-and-or-hypercapnia,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-mask-hypercapni/partly-false-claim-continually-wearing-a-mask-causes-hypercapnia-idUSKBN22H2H1,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprevent-getting-sick%2Fcloth-face-cover-faq.html",Claims that face masks can cause illnesses are just hot air,,,,,,

There’s also a social media post by someone called Serena Williams getting a lot of attention at the moment in the US and elsewhere in the world. The post shows a screenshot of a Facebook post. The screenshot has been shared on Instagram with a banner that tags the @serenawilliams Instagram page of the sports star.The Facebook post itself, from someone called Serena Williams, starts with “I’m sick of covid-19, I’m sick of black vs. white, I’m sick of Democrats vs. Republican, I’m sick of gay vs. straight. I’m sick of Christian vs atheist. I’m really sick of the media.” It continues with statements that people should support whoever they wish in the upcoming US election and believe in God if they wish, before ending with: “If you can’t handle the fact that you may have a friend that has opposing views as you, then you are not any better than the bigots and the racists.

There is NO pandemic. This is Agenda 21 being played out in real life.”There are numerous examples of the post by overseas groups here, here, here and here and in Australia by chef Pete Evans among others – here and here. Mr Evans’ June 27 post has generated more than 1000 shares, 6500 reactions and more than 365,000 views. A Facebook post claims that there is no COVID-19 pandemic. The AnalysisThe Facebook post’s primary claim is that the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused nearly 500,000 deaths globally does not exist. As at June 30,  the US had recorded highest number fatalities followed by Brazil, the UK, Italy and France, according to a COVID-19 map by Johns Hopkins University in the US.In December 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in Wuhan, China. In January, the UN agency for public health, the World Health Organization (WHO), determined that the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus and issued a statement saying there was evidence to suggest human-to-human transmission in Wuhan.In February, WHO announced that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus would be named COVID-19.On March 11, the World Health Organization officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. At the media briefing to make the announcement, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.“Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do. We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”In a 2010 article titled, ‘What is a pandemic?”,  the World Health Organization defined it as “the worldwide spread of a new disease”. To illustrate the spread of COVID-19, the US public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, listed on June 26 at least 215 countries and territories with confirmed cases of the virus based on regions defined by the World Health Organization.WHO also outlines the phases of a pandemic in a 2009 guidance document. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11.","http://archive.is/sQjOq,http://archive.is/ZOp3p,http://archive.is/oxzfH,http://archive.is/LjSee,http://archive.is/xVwlW,http://archive.is/IkmZM,http://archive.is/HIUQ4,http://archive.is/yNUl5,http://archive.is/N8tv3,https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-06-2020-covidtimeline,https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are,https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020,https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632?s=20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbT6AANFOm4,https://www.who.int/dg/biography,https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/pandemic/en/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/world-map.html,https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/pandemic_phase_descriptions_and_actions.pdf?ua=1",Claim of no COVID-19 pandemic ignores basic facts,,,,,,

In the video a man makes a series of claims about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and what he says is information from a whistleblower in GSK.The central claim is that a COVID-19 vaccine already exists and contains chemicals that cause infertility.The post has been shared more than 390 times since it was posted on June 17, 2020. The same meme or claims based on the video have appeared on other pages and platforms including here, here and here. A Facebook post claims to expose information from a whistleblower about a COVID-19 vaccine. The AnalysisThe Facebook post claims an unidentified “UK GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower” revealed “the upcoming covid vaccine” will contain antigens that cause infertility. The video, created by an individual introduced as Zed Phoenix (and later named as Ben Fellows) makes a series of claims, including that a GSK insider delivered information that a COVID-19 vaccine had already been made.In the video the speaker says he wants to “look at who is running the vaccine trial” and names Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath, saying he “spoke on television the other night”. Phoenix says Dr Preston received a £28 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which he claims is “interfering and trying to manipulate” human vaccine trials.There is no record of Dr Preston leading a trial of a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial of a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK has been run by a team at Oxford University.Dr Preston has been in the media talking about vaccine development but as a commentator.There is no evidence that Dr Preston received a £28 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The 28 million figure may be drawn from an international whooping cough vaccine research project in which Dr Preston and Bath University are among 22 organisations involved. That project received a 28 million euro grant, €21 million of which came from the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, with €7 million  from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The video describes the claims as coming from “an alleged GSK insider” who “believes that certain antigens are going to appear in the vaccine” (1m23s).The speaker says, “We’re one foot in this and one foot out but I’m going to go through this and I’m going to present it as though it’s the truth, because I believe it is”.  (4m20s)Reading from unidentified documents, the speaker says (4m37s) “there is going to be an anti-HCG antigen. Now this is, HCG is something for, um, causes sterility in women. It is also combined with HCG and OLH and 37 amino acid carboxy-terminal peptides … The principle of anti-hCG vaccine is to introduce antibodies which can bind to hCG and render it biologically inactive.”The statement that HCG causes sterility is incorrect. HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy.The remainder of the statement matches almost verbatim part of an unrelated, 31-year-old review of anti-fertility vaccine research from the National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi, India.Other parts read from the documents also match the 1989 review paper, including: “GnRH resulted in decreased testicular size, drop of testosterone levels, and marked atrophy of the prostate” (5m51s) and “a sperm-specific mitochondrial antigen, produced an antibody response in baboons and reduced fertility in the females”. (6m37s)The speaker also says that GSK tested 63 women with a vaccine containing anti-hGC antigens that resulted in 61 becoming infertile (5m29s). Those statistics also appear in the 1989 paper and an older one, by one of the same researchers and are not related to GSK.University of Queensland Infectious Diseases Physician and Microbiologist Associate Professor Paul Griffin told AAP FactCheck the argument advanced in the video is “fundamentally flawed”.Prof Griffin said the 1989 paper referred to in the video “was obviously very deliberately about a vaccine for contraception or cancer research”.“They picked together a few unrelated concepts in an implausible way to try and mount an argument, suggesting that a COVID vaccine was going to leave people infertile. There’s just nothing to substantiate that,” Prof Griffin said.“Vaccine ingredients are freely available, highly transparent and these days, the way we make vaccines is so specific, based on such good technology, that the prospect of a vaccine having collateral effects such as this is just not realistic.”The speaker also says in the video that there are separate vaccines for males and females.Prof Griffin dismissed the suggestion, saying there is no difference for males and females for the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine.“For something that we want an immunological response to protect from a pathogen, there’s no sex difference based on that, so there’s no suggestion we’re going to have a male and a female COVID vaccine,” he said. A researcher conducts a COVID-19 vaccine test at a laboratory.","https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/search-for-covid19-vaccine-a4422136.html,http://archive.today/1XCaZ,https://www.facebook.com/nojabnopaynoway/posts/3036772759694230,http://archive.today/7jo15,http://archive.is/ijuhU,http://archive.vn/QJjEN,http://archive.vn/Djcjp,https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/antigen,https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-preston,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/,https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/covid-19-vaccine-development,https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-vaccine-uk-when-lockdown-4009233,https://twitter.com/bbc5live/status/1252848243219685383?lang=en ,http://archive.today/BQ5TP,https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Human_Chorionic_Gonadotropin,http://archive.today/VIpgr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2665354/,http://archive.today/hQTev,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/5596",COVID-19 vaccine “whistleblower” information sounds a lot like an unrelated study from 1989,,,,,,

It also claims another reason for that is it gives millions of people “without an official ID a virtual ID”.The post features a photo of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern with the words, “19th Sept 2020.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed more than $US350 million to respond to the global pandemic, including searching for vaccines.Mr Gates’ profile has resulted in him being the subject of false claims and conspiracy theories.The May 30 Facebook post says: “Yesterday morning on tv it was mentioned that New Zealand is a perfect country to test and trial the COVID-19 vaccine. This is because of our low spread rate and our position being surrounded by the ocean. This would also explain one of the reasons Bill Gates is currently in our country.“They said on the radio 2 days ago that we may not be able to travel overseas anymore unless we have the vaccine.“I read that Bill Gates’ ultimate goal is to microchip the vaccine so that you can be tracked and traced while moving ‘safely’ within society. Another reason, apparently, is so that it gives the millions of people around the world without an official ID a virtual ID.”However a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told AAP FactCheck that Mr Gates was not in New Zealand in May.“Bill has not travelled to New Zealand in 2020,” the spokesperson said in an email.Claims Mr Gates’ goal is to microchip a COVID-19 vaccine have been fact checked multiple times, including here and here, and found to be false. Mr Gates has denied them.In June Mr Gates told reporters: “I’ve never been involved any sort of microchip-type thing.“It is good to know which kids have had a measles vaccine and which have not, so there are data systems and… health records that people use to track that… but there’s no chips or anything like that.“It’s almost hard to deny this stuff because it’s so stupid or strange, that to even to repeat almost seems to give it credibility.”According to a Reuters fact check, claims Mr Gates planned to launch microchip skin implants emerged after a March 2020 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” Q&A in which he mentioned foreseeing the use of “digital certificates” to show who has been tested for COVID-19 or who has recovered from the disease.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation subsequently told Reuters via email that: “The reference to ‘digital certificates’ relates to efforts to create an open source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing”.It’s not clear why the post features a photograph of New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern while the reference to NZ being a “perfect country” to test and trial a COVID-19 vaccine appears to be taken from a comment made by the head of a New Zealand pharmaceutical company in May. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told AAP FactCheck that Mr Gates was not in New Zealand in May.","http://archive.is/ob9Ce,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/TheOptimist/Articles/coronavirus-mark-suzman-funding-announcement-2,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/conspiracy-theory-misinterprets-goals-of-gates-foundation/,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/qanon-supporters-and-anti-vaxxers-are-spreading-a-hoax-that,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/,http://archive.today/dxrul,http://archive.today/GYma3,http://archive.today/hONRE,http://archive.today/f0rrw,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-gates-fauci/false-claim-bill-gates-wants-to-microchip-people-anthony-fauci-wants-people-to-carry-vaccination-certificates-idUSKBN22H2JD,http://archive.is/JMEqy",Bill Gates wasn’t in NZ this year and those microchip claims have already been debunked,,,,,,

So why are we so quick to demolish other statues and monuments around the world?”The post’s caption reads: “If we wanted to demolish anything built by slaves around the world we wouldn’t be left with many famous landmarks left [sic] ……”The post has been viewed over 35,000 times, been shared over 400 times and commented on over 150 times. A Facebook post claims the pyramids of Egypt were built by slaves but that was not the case. The AnalysisThe death of US man George Floyd in police custody and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed have sparked anti-racism protests around the world including in the United Kingdom and Australia.Statues of historical figures associated with slavery became a focus of some protests. In the UK protesters tore down the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, who as the deputy head of the Royal African Company trafficked slaves from Africa to the UK.During a June 12 protest in Sydney police encircled a statue of Captain Cook over concerns protesters would attempt to topple it.The targeting of memorials and historical statues has sparked debate, with some commentators and politicians arguing against itThe June 12 Facebook post sought to present Egypt’s pyramids as an example of something “built by african slaves” and question why they were not targeted.But the pyramids were not built by slaves.Erected 4500 years ago, the Pyramids of Giza are relics of Egypt’s Old Kingdom. The world-famous structures were erected as tombs for the pharaohs.How the pyramids of Giza were built remains one of Egypt’s biggest mysteries but Macquarie University Egyptologist Dr Karin Sowada told AAP FactCheck, that archaeological evidence shows the pyramids were not built by slaves.That misconception began with the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus and later continued with Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who both claimed that slaves, Hebrew or otherwise, built the pyramids.“However it has to be remembered that Herodotus was writing 2000 years after the pyramids were built,” Dr Sowada said.“And considering the biblical timeline there’s no possible way, chronologically, that Hebrews were in Egypt when the pyramids were under construction.”Slavery did exist at certain periods in Ancient Egyptian history and many slaves were likely foreign prisoners of war. Yet archaeological evidence shows that an Egyptian workforce built the pyramids, Dr Sowada said.One key piece of evidence discovered in 2013 was a daily journal written by a man called Merer, an official responsible for transporting blocks from stone quarries to the pyramids.“The picture painted in the papyrus fragments is of a well-organised, well-provisioned team of about 40 men… who were not  slaves but people well-skilled in their jobs,” Dr Sowada said.Another piece of evidence is the discovery of a workers’ settlement at Giza, which showed the accommodations of an Egytpian workforce likely made up of a permanent cohort of elite workers such as stonemasons and labour teams.Farm labourers were drafted into the project during the yearly flooding of the Nile which inundated farmlands, with the work seen as a period of obligatory public service, not slavery, Dr Sowada said.“Think of it as the population called in when there wasn’t much work around to help with a large nation-building project – almost an ancient ‘work for the dole’ arrangement, except wages were paid in food and lodging,” she said. Egyptologists say evidence shows the pyramids of Giza were not built by slaves.","http://archive.is/Jgiwn,https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd-protests-timeline.html,https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/15/in-pictures-black-lives-matter-protests-taking-on-the-world,http://archive.today/ydFR8,http://archive.is/FfaO4,https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-royal-african-company,http://archive.is/rw3kA,https://www.smh.com.au/national/censoring-history-makes-the-past-impossible-to-grasp-20200615-p552pn.html?btis,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/as-racist-statues-topple-around-the-world-australia-is-being-urged-to-address-its-own-monuments,http://archive.is/Jgiwn,https://www.ancient.eu/Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt/,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/giza-pyramids/,http://archive.is/12cIR,https://theconversation.com/guide-to-the-classics-the-histories-by-herodotus-53748,http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/,http://archive.is/cBiDq,http://archive.is/P2YMj",The pyramids of Giza were not built by slaves,,,,,,

Hillary was in court and lost her case about the missing emails and will have to testify in September.” It also claims that former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was due to testify on June 3 and that on June 4 the US Senate was due to vote on issuing subpoenas to officials in the administration of former US president Barack Obama.The post finishes by asking, “Didn’t see any of this did you? Were you distracted?”There have been multiple examples of the post found here, here and here. They have been viewed more than 35,000 times and shared more than 500 times. A post claims news reports on US riots and COVID-19 were a distraction from a Clinton court case. The AnalysisAs November’s US presidential election ramps up, a major issue from the 2016 campaign is again rearing its head. Controversy surrounding former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server continues to generate interest through ongoing legal action by activist group Judicial Watch.The Facebook post makes three claims, the first of which relates to the purported court appearance of Ms Clinton on June 2. It also claims that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was due to testify on June 3 and that on June 4 the US Senate was due to vote on whether to subpoena “Obama officials” in the so-called “Obamagate” inquiry.It is true that Mr Rosenstein testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 3. Part of his testimony was a defence of his decision to appoint special prosecutor Robert Mueller to investigate whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 US election.On June 4, the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, met to consider authorising a range of subpoenas to former Obama administration officials with possible links to the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. The committee approved the authorisation on June 11.However the post’s claims that Ms Clinton was in court on June 2 and lost her case are not correct. Ms Clinton was not in court but was represented by lawyer David Kendall, an audio file of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing shows. The hearing was held via phone because of the COVID-19 pandemic and Ms Clinton’s lawyer argued against the former secretary of state giving an in-person deposition.The depositions of Ms Clinton and her former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, were ordered by a DC district court judge on March 2. according to a Washington Examiner  report from June 5, the Court of Appeals will decide on Ms Clinton’s bid to avoid a deposition in the next few weeks. AAP FactCheck found no evidence to support the claim that Ms Clinton will “have to testify in September”. The Facebook post’s claim that Hillary Clinton was in court on June 2 is not correct.","http://archive.vn/ZFiP7,http://archive.is/iDYlM,http://archive.is/zs2kv,http://archive.is/FyK7W,http://archive.vn/0aKpZ,https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/06/02/this-is-no-longer-secretary-clintons-state-department-judges-wary-of-her-deposition-over-emails/?slreturn=20200515002441,https://www.judicialwatch.org/,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what-is-obamagate-and-is-it-the-biggest-political-crime-in-american-history,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/rod-rosenstein.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/rod-rosenstein-testimony-russia-trump/index.html,https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/06/04/2020/executive-business-meeting-1,https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/,https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/06/11/2020/executive-business-meeting,https://web.archive.org/web/20080910234649/http://www.wc.com/attorney-DavidKendall.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3OoVnWT0oU,http://archive.vn/wLhAK,https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/06/02/this-is-no-longer-secretary-clintons-state-department-judges-wary-of-her-deposition-over-emails/,http://archive.today/JfiO3,https://archive.vn/chXiY","Hillary Clinton has not had her day in court, nor lost her case",,,,,,

Despite the 2019 date it has resurfaced recently.The post claims to show a letter from “Ed Chenel, a police officer in Australia”. Starting with “Hi Yanks” the letter says it will tell Americans about “the real figures from Down Under” 12 months after “gun owners in Australia were forced by a new law” to surrender 640,000 firearms. It claims there have been increases in homicides, assaults and armed robberies since the new law was introduced.This post has been viewed more than 1.2 million times and shared 46,000 times.It has also appeared on another New Zealand-based page here. A post claiming to show a police officer’s views about new gun laws has circulated online for years. The AnalysisDespite being dated November, 2019 and circulating in early 2020, the purported letter from “Ed Chenel” has been circulating on the internet for almost 20 years.  It shows up in online forums as far back as 2001 and was circulating on US-based pages such as this and this during 2019 It’s unclear whether an “Australian police officer” Chenel ever existed, as Google searches for his name only lead back to this same letter or many other articles – here, here and here -also debunking it.Despite its “Australian Gun Law Update” headline, the post refers to laws introduced in Australia nearly 25 years ago, after the Port Arthur Massacre in Tasmania in April, 1996 that left 35 people dead.In 1996 former Prime Minister John Howard co-ordinated the National Firearms Agreement, which included a temporary firearms buyback program that resulted in about 640,000 prohibited weapons being bought back between 1996 and 1997.The post claims “first year results are now in” and show homicide rates rose 6.2 per cent. The Australian Institute of Criminology report, Homicide In Australia 2017-18, published in 2020, shows this claim is false.The report shows (Table A3, page 20)  that homicides occurred at a rate of 1.82 per 100,000 people in 1994-95, then 1.66 per 100,000 in 1995-96 (the period including the April 28, 1996 Port Arthur massacre).Homicides were 1.62 per 100,000 in 1996-97 and 1.61 in 1997-98 – a continuing decrease. Actual numbers of homicides also declined from 327 in 1994-95 to 303 in 1995-96, then 299 in 1996-97, then 300 for 1997-98.Homicides did rise to 328 in 1998-99 – a 9.3 per cent rise on the previous year, then fell to 305 in 1999-2000 – a seven per cent drop. The report shows (Figure 1, page 1) a steady drop in homicides from 1989 to 2017-18, the lowest since the National Homicide Monitoring Program began in 1989. A 2006 study by University of Sydney and Macquarie University researchers found that the decline in total firearm deaths accelerated after the introduction of the gun laws. And a 2012 paper in American Law and Economics Review by Australian National University researcher Andrew Leigh and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario stated: “Firearm deaths – both homicide and suicide – are currently at exceptionally low levels by historical standards”. The post claims that assaults were up 9.6 per cent in the year after the gun law changes. This statistic is inaccurate: Australian Bureau of Statistics data (p42) shows there was an 8.6 per cent increase in assault from 1996 to 1997 and a 6.8 per cent increase in assault between 1997 and 1998.There was already a rising trend, however, with a 12 per cent increase in assault victims between 1995 and 1996 (p46).The 2008 Australian Institute of Criminology report, Trends in Violent Crime, also notes there has been a rising trend in assaults since 1995. The claim that there was a 44 per cent increase in armed robberies is correct: ABS statistics show a 44 per cent  increase in the number of victims of armed robbery from 1996 to 1997 (p67)There was an 18 per cent increase in the number of victims of armed robbery from 1995 to 1996 and a 20 per cent increase from 1997 to 1998.The image with the Facebook post, of a truckload of firearms being tipped out, is a Reuters photograph from July,1997 of guns sent to be destroyed after the Australian government buyback scheme.  A claim that homicides rose after new gun control laws were introduced is false.","http://archive.is/BJI5N,http://archive.today/PdFPr,https://www.google.com/search?q=ed+chenel+australian+police+officer&rlz=1C5CHFA_enNZ868NZ868&oq=ed+chenel+police+&aqs=chrome.3.69i57j0l3j69i60.4761j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=938877,http://archive.today/u6KPA,http://archive.today/sIHJQ,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/australian-guns/,https://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/13/facebook-posts/no-viral-post-isnt-correct-australias-gun-laws-vio/,https://www.britannica.com/event/Port-Arthur-Massacre,https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1399510/17-257.pdf,https://www.anao.gov.au/sites/default/files/anao_report_1997-98_25.pdf?acsf_files_redirect,https://aic.gov.au/file/7107/download?token=iPgBHCZy,https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/12/6/365,http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf,https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/CA25687100069892CA256889001BD393/$File/45100_1997.pdf,https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/AEA456A1A5E09337CA25722500049615/$File/45100_1996.pdf,https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi359,https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/CA25687100069892CA256889001BD393/$File/45100_1997.pdf,https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/AEA456A1A5E09337CA25722500049615/$File/45100_1996.pdf,https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/CA25687100069892CA25688800283A7D/$File/45100_1998.pdf,https://stock.adobe.com/nz/146552521?as_campaign=TinEye&as_content=tineye_match&epi1=146552521&tduid=8d968f433e5f8c28bac3a156b99f98f6&as_channel=affiliate&as_campclass=redirect&as_source=arvato",Reloaded “police officer’s letter” on Aussie gun laws misses the mark again,,,,,,

Simpsons never seem to fail An episode from many years ago”.AAP FactCheck has found similar posts here, here, here and here. In total the posts have been viewed over 100,000 times and shared over 2000 times. A Facebook post showing Simpsons-style images of George Floyd is not from the TV series. The AnalysisProtests have taken place in many cities across the United States since the death of African American man George Floyd on May 25.A video showing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee placed on Floyd’s neck while the former athlete told the officer he couldn’t breathe, has been shared around the world.Two autopsies determined Mr Floyd’s death was a homicide.Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and moved to a maximum security prison.Multiple Facebook posts claim the Simpsons-style images of George Floyd being arrested come from an episode aired in the 1990’s or from the 1996 episode “The Day Violence Died”.However, the images are not from the Simpsons TV show. They were first published by Italian artist Yuri Pomo on his instagram account on May 30, 2020, (here and here) six days after Floyd’s death in police custody.The picture featuring Mr Floyd and Police Chief Wiggum is captioned: “Imagine you’re sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show…”The picture featuring Mr Floyd as an angel is captioned: “This is my way of honoring what’s right in this world, and I hope it’ll get to you as it’s supposed to do.

Go to settings 2. Scroll down to Google Services and launch 3. If Covid-19 Exposure Notifications is on top of the list, then tap on the three dots on the top right hand corner of your screen. 4. Tap Usage & Diagnostics 5. Turn off”. It finishes by telling users to “check regularly in case the Android system turns this on automatically”.AAP FactCheck has found three reposts, here, here and here. In total the posts have been viewed more than 85,000 times and been shared more than 1300 times. A widely shared post wrongly claims software on Android phones is the same as the COVIDSafe app. The AnalysisAs COVID-19 spread around the world a number of national health authorities created smartphone apps to help track the spread of the virus.Australia’s tracing app, COVIDSafe, was released in late April, 2020.The app uses anonymised data gathered via Bluetooth to trace the contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19. The federal Department of Health has urged people to download the app but it is not mandatory.The June 7 Facebook post and others like it claim Google has “automatically” signed Android phone users up to COVIDSafe. It claims the presence of software called “COVID-19 Exposure Notification” in a phone’s settings is proof of this. This claim is false.Google and Apple worked together to create the COVID-19 Exposure Notifications System.Released On May 20, the system is an API, or Application Programming Interface. It is not an app. An API is an interface that defines how applications communicate with each other.A joint statement from Google and Apple specifically notes that what the tech companies have built “‘is not an app”.“Public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install,” the statement says.The COVID-19 Exposure Notifications API will “enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones”, the statement says.While the API can be used by public health authority tracing apps, the Australian COVID-19 contact tracing app, COVIDSafe, does not work with it. (See section: When will the Apple-Google API technology be available?”)COVIDSafe is based on an approach that uses and shares information about contacts differently to the API. Under the COVIDSafe model, the anonymous “keys” that phones use to note the proximity of other phones are generated from a central server. The Google-Apple API generates the keys within each phone. There are also differences in how information about potential exposures to COVID-19 is shared and how notifications are sent.University of Western Australia WA senior research fellow Dr David Glance told AAP FactCheck the API was included in recent system upgrades for Apple and Android phones but will only work in countries where health authorities have decided to use a compatible app.For Australian health authorities to start using the API, they would have to completely change the design of the COVIDSafe app, he said.“The API has absolutely nothing to do with the application,” Dr Glance said in a phone interview.Dr Glance, from UWA’s Faculty of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, said the post’s instructions are also misleading because they refer to settings for the usage and diagnostics that Google collects about apps such as running time and energy consumption. Taking the steps outlined has no effect on the exposure notifications API, he said.“So the post is a complete fabrication which, if followed, simply switches off the ability for Google to receive diagnostics – note that this is off by default also and you need to consent to having it switched on,” Dr Glance said. Australia’s COVIDSafe app is not related to Google-developed software found on Android phones.","http://archive.is/PZfTJ,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158147987453361&set=a.10150365182578361&type=3&theater,http://archive.is/Q1UUq,http://archive.is/FfUIr,http://archive.is/hHUkt,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/countries-around-world-are-rolling-out-contact-tracing-apps-contain-coronavirus-how,http://archive.is/OQfa9,https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app/covidsafe-help#:~:text=COVIDSafe%20uses%20Bluetooth%C2%AE%20to,duration%20of%20any%20contact.,http://archive.is/PZfTJ,http://archive.is/npTIt,http://archive.is/IDrqx,http://archive.is/0TdDq,http://archive.is/IDrqx,https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app/covidsafe-help#:~:text=COVIDSafe%20uses%20Bluetooth%C2%AE%20to,duration%20of%20any%20contact.,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/david-glance",What it really means when “COVID-19 exposure notifications” is in your phone settings,,,,,,

It reads, “Hi There, In light of recent events LEGO has requested the below products to be removed from sites and any marketing ASAP” and is followed by a list of Lego police and firefighter sets as well as the White House.Accompanying the post is a comment by the group Lego Star Wars II-core, which reads, “Lego are officially removing police sets from the shelves, legends.”The June 4 post has received more than 115,000 views and more than 640 shares. A Facebook post claims Lego is pulling police and emergency services-themed sets from shelves. The AnalysisThe email featured in the Facebook post bears the watermark of Toy Book, a  US-based trade magazine for the toy industry.In an article published on June 2, Toy Book said it received “a copy of an email sent to affiliate marketers by Rakuten Linkshare on behalf of the Lego Group”.The article goes on to say the email requested the removal of product listings for more than 30 Lego building sets including mini figures and accessories that include the representation of police officers, firefighters, criminals, emergency vehicles, and buildings. Among the sets listed are Lego City Police Station, Fire Station, Police Dog Unit, Patrol Car, Fire Plane, Mobile Command Centre, Police Highway Arrest, the Lego City Donut Shop Opening set and “Crook” mini figures including a Police Handcuffs & Badge Set and the adult builder Lego Creator version of The White House.The Facebook post led many to draw the conclusion that Lego was pulling products, including Brad Parscale,  US President Donald Trump’s campaign manager. Mr Parscale tweeted on June 4: “This is nuts. @LEGO_Group is removing playsets featuring police, firefighters & emergency vehicles. Even ditching an adult White House kit. We ought to stress the good in law enforcement for kids. What does @JoeBiden think about LEGO erasing cops?”However Lego addressed the Toy Book report via its Twitter account on June 5: “We’ve seen incorrect reports saying we’ve removed some LEGO sets from sale. To be clear, that is not the case and reports otherwise are false. Our intention was to temporarily pause digital advertising in response to events in the US.”A Lego spokesperson told Toy Book the company had “requested that our affiliate partners refrain from posting promotional LEGO content as part of our decision to respect #BlackOutTuesday and pause posting content on our social media channels in response to the tragic events in the US.”Blackout Tuesday took place on June 2 as a protest against racism and police brutality following the death of African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. The Facebook post led many to draw the conclusion that Lego was pulling products such as police playsets.","http://archive.is/Qao6U,https://www.instagram.com/lego/,https://toybook.com/,https://toybook.com/about-us/,https://toybook.com/lego-pulling-back-potentially-sensitive-product-amid-george-floyd-protests/,https://rakutenadvertising.com/content/linkshare/#top,https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/donut-shop-opening-60233,https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/police-handcuffs-badge-854018,https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-white-house-21054,http://archive.is/GlIZN,http://archive.vn/aLbks,https://toybook.com/lego-pulling-back-potentially-sensitive-product-amid-george-floyd-protests/,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/blackout-tuesday-black-lives-matter-instagram-trnd/index.html,https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/06/04/george-floyd-was-killed-on-may-25th",Lego won’t cop rumours that playsets have been pulled from stores,,,,,,

Apronax is an anti-inflammatory drug.The Facebook post, which has been shared around the world, including by users in Australia, has attracted 77, 000 views and more than 620 shares. A Facebook post makes a series of false claims about COVID-19 and the work of doctors in Italy. The AnalysisThe Facebook post makes three main claims:Claim 1: COVID-19 is nothing but “diffuse intravascular coagulation (thrombosis)”. This claim is false. The Australian Government’s Department of Health describes COVID-19 as “a respiratory illness caused by a new virus“. The World Health Organization lists COVID-19 as an infectious disease caused by  a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronaviruses, the WHO says, are a large family of viruses, several of which cause “respiratory infections”. The virus responsible for COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).There have been several studies which found severe COVID-19 cases associated with thrombosis, which is blood clotting inside blood vessels. A study in Ireland found abnormal blood clotting in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. An Italian study observed “thromboembolic events” in 28 out of 388 patients with COVID-19 in intensive care in Milan.Professor Huyen Tran, a director of the Clinical Thrombosis Centre with the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, told AAP FactCheck in an email that severe COVID-19 infection “appears to be associated with an increased rate of venous thrombosis”.Prof Tran said there have also been “sporadic case reports of arterial thrombosis”.Claim 2:  The Facebook post says Italian doctors who performed autopsies discovered that COVID-19 “is not a virus” but a bacteria that causes death and the formation of blood clots.The claim COVID-19 is “not a virus” is false.  The World Health Organization states that it is a “new virus” that was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Italy’s Health Ministry (Ministero della Salute), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Johns Hopkins Medicine in the US all list COVID-19 as a newly identified coronavirus.The claim is contradicted by a preliminary study by Italian pathologists who performed autopsies on 38 victims of COVID-19 in northern Italy. One of the pathologists, Dr Aurelio Sonzogni of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, told fact checkers PolitiFact the study did not change the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that can’t be treated with antibiotics. PolitiFact noted the study had not been peer reviewed for publication in a medical journal.Claim 3: The post says the way to treat COVID-19 is “antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulants; such as: aspirin”.  It claims the Italian Ministry of Health changed its COVID-19 treatment protocols and started giving “Aspirin 100mg and Apronax” to their positive patients.”Italy’s health ministry website says in a Q & A on treatment for COVID-19 that “there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus”.The ministry’s website refers to the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) for drugs available to COVID-19 patients. In an AIFA document, titled “Drugs usable for the treatment of COVID-19 disease”, aspirin is not listed. It is also not included on the clinical trials list.The World Health Organization confirms that antibiotics should not be used  in trying to prevent or treat COVID-19. The WHO says there is “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus”.Prof Tran told AAP FactCheck there is no evidence that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Apronax are effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Italian health officials say there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.","http://archive.is/9tdUi,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/what-you-need-to-know-about-coronavirus-covid-19,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/thrombosis,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200430113015.htm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177070/,https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/huyen-tran,https://www.monash.edu/medicine/ccs/blood-disease,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=5365&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Coronavirus-Disease-2019-Basics,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20054262v1.full.pdf+html,http://www.asst-pg23.it/section/957/AURELIO_SONZOGNI,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/no-covid-19-wont-respond-antibiotics-despite-findi/,http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=230#6,https://www.aifa.gov.it/aggiornamento-sui-farmaci-utilizzabili-per-il-trattamento-della-malattia-covid19,https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&hl=en&pto=aue&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.aifa.gov.it/sperimentazioni-cliniche-covid-19,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#:~:text=No%2C%20antibiotics%20do%20not,%2Dinfection%20is%20possible.,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11643-1289/naproxen-sodium-oral/naproxen-oral/details",Italy did not find a treatment to defeat COVID-19 and did not say the disease is caused by bacteria,,,,,,

I’m so glad we don’t have any racism here in Australia.” The Facebook post reads: “So this is what our prime minister tweets…. Is he for real! Racism is alive and well in Australia, we as Aboriginal people live with it everyday is he really that out of touch!!!” AAP FactCheck has found three other posts sharing the screenshot of the tweet with similarly critical commentary here, here and here. In total the posts have been viewed more than 100,000 times, shared over 1800 times and received over 150 comments.  A post shows a screenshot of a tweet from a parody account, not a genuine tweet from Australia’s PM. The AnalysisAfrican American man George Floyd died after being restrained by multiple police officers on May 24 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since his death protests have raged in US cities, with many turning violent and resulting in the destruction of property and looting of stores. The protests have attracted global attention, with acitivists in Australia organising rallies in solidarity and to raise awareness for Aboriginal deaths in custody. The series of Facebook posts share a screenshot of a tweet that appears to be from the PM Scott Morrison and reads: “Watching with concern the developments in the US. I’m so glad we don’t have any racism here in Australia.” The tweet, however, is from a parody account, not from the Australian PM’s official twitter account. There is no record of the PM making the remarks featured in the screenshot. The parody account name on Twitter displays as “Scott Morrison PM of Australia (parody)“, however the “(parody)” part of the name does not appear in the screen shots used in the various Facebook posts. AAP FactCheck contacted the owner of the parody account, who replied that the “(parody)” part of the name has always been in the title but doesn’t display on some mobile devices. “I do get multiple DMs every day from people thinking I am actually Scott Morrison,” the user said. Many commenters on the posts point out that the tweet comes from a parody account, with one such comment saying: “Sorry but this screenshot is fake”.However other users appear to believe the tweet came from the Prime Minister of Australia. One commenter wrote: “Far out talk about delusional and this clown runs the country just like America – two clowns and add Pauline to the mix.” People at a Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney after the death in police custody of George Floyd.","http://archive.is/2ntLT,https://connect.aap.com.au/http/archive.is/dayJ7,http://archive.vn/n1r2L,http://archive.vn/OHrsO,http://archive.vn/2yLGb,http://archive.vn/teK6e,http://archive.is/dayJ7,http://archive.is/2ntLT,http://archive.is/D1Hnl,http://archive.is/hXpuX,http://archive.is/O34K2,http://archive.vn/n1r2L,https://twitter.com/ScottyFromMktg,https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP,https://twitter.com/ScottyFromMktg,https://twitter.com/ScottyFromMktg",PM Morrison did not issue tweet about not having any racism in Australia,,,,,,

S-protein 120 is found in only one other virus known to man, HIV.” It then claims “the current strain of Covid-19 is indeed genetically modified by inserting these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore making it a weapon”. It ends with a claim that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, “was the first person to identify, isolate and isolate PATENT’s (sic) spike-glycoprotein S-120” and a link to a series of patents.Another post makes the same claims. The two posts have been shared over 700 times, viewed over 30,000 times and attracted over 90 comments between them. A post makes a false claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares proteins with HIV. The AnalysisThe May 20 Facebook post claims the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a “120 point” spike glycoprotein, or “S-Protein” that is found only in one other virus, HIV. Spike glycoproteins are proteins on the outside of a virus particle that bind the virus to a cell – in a human, animal or whatever the host is – that can be  infected.University of New South Wales (UNSW) molecular microbiology researcher, Professor Peter White, told AAP FactCheck that the spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 does not have “120 points”.Professor White’s UNSW colleague, PhD researcher Emma Harding, said the spike glycoprotein found in SARS-CoV-2 is not found in HIV.The May 20 Facebook post carries a link to a series of patents filed in the past by the current director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr Anthony Fauci, claiming they are “a nail in a coffin and that Dr Fauci “was the first person to “identify, isolate and isolate[sic]  PATENT’s spike-glycoprotein S-120”.However there is no patent for a “spike-glycoprotein S-120”. Dr Fauci is a leading researcher on HIV and other immune system-related infectious diseases. The patents linked to include HIV treatments he worked on that target GP120, the glycoprotein the HIV virus uses to attack white blood cells. GP120 was discovered by Harvard researchers in the 1980s. The protein derives its name from the protein’s molecular weight of 120 kilodaltons (kDa), the federal Department of Health told AAP FactCheck in an email.The “S-120” used in the post seems to take the “120” from the GP120 found in HIV.UNSW researcher Ms Harding, said GP120 and the S-glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 “are entirely different proteins”.“GP120 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein connect to two entirely different cell receptors and lead to both viruses being able to enter very different types of cells,” she said. The Facebook post also claims “the current strain of Covid-19 is indeed genetically modified by inserting these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore making it a weapon”.Claims that COVID-19 contains “inserted” HIV characteristics have been debunked in the past. The claims were tied to a now-withdrawn study posted to a non-peer-reviewed pre-publish website.The May 20 Facebook post goes on to claim SARS-CoV-2 is “genetically modified” and therefore a “weapon”. However, scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 could not be a lab construct and the US intelligence community says the virus is not genetically modified or man-made. A Facebook post falsely claims Dr Anthony Fauci has a patent on a protein from the COVID-19 virus.","http://archive.is/6Vi7D,http://archive.is/rWMCe,http://archive.today/ONIEa,https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/our-people/peter-white,https://patents.justia.com/inventor/anthony-s-fauci?fbclid=IwAR2QWya6iY2qVF1DwcPS-6NtOccWq8tvxzS_R8mW_ux9OP5LPHKLW-YGDvA,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/anthony-s-fauci-md-bio,http://archive.is/EeWxD,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/the-2019-coronavirus-is-not-a-man-made-combination-of-hiv-and-sars,http://archive.is/RKjjc,http://archive.is/aHUPk",COVID-19 virus doesn’t share “spikes” with HIV and Fauci didn’t patent them,,,,,,

You know  it turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people;  we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects, you know, if we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s… way more, 700,000, ah… people who will suffer from that. And that actual decision of, OK, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world – governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed ”The video has been edited to cut out parts of Mr Gates’s answer. Below is the full transcript from the relevant section of the interview. The full interview is on the CNBC website.The relevant starts at the 11 minute, 36 second mark. The parts of Mr Gates’s response left out in the Instagram video are shown in bold. Mr Gates says:“The efficacy in vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. You know it turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people; most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. You know if we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s… way more – 700,000… people who will suffer from that.“So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges…  – pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard. And that actual decision of, OK, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world – governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”The text in the Instagram post claims Mr Gates “freely admits” a vaccine “will seriously injure or even kill upwards of 700,000 people”. This is false. What Mr Gates says – evident even in the edited video – is that a vaccine is needed that works in older people “and yet you don’t have side effects”. At no point does he say a vaccine will injure or kill upwards of 700,000 people.Also edited out are the parts of Mr Gates’s response that say “understanding the safety at gigantic scale … it’s very, very hard” and governments will need to be involved because of the risk and indemnification needed “before that (administering a vaccine) can be decided on”.The figure of 700,000 relates to a statement Mr Gates makes earlier in the interview, at the 9 minutes, 30 seconds mark. He says making seven billion doses of a vaccine (seven billion being close to the current global population of 7.7 billion) “is going to be an incredible challenge”.One in every 10,000 people out of a population of seven billion people, equals 700,000 people. Bill Gates’s work to support vaccine research has attracted false claims and conspiracy theories.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CAWeP4WhaWP/,http://archive.today/j0pb1,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/TheOptimist/Articles/coronavirus-mark-suzman-funding-announcement-2,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/conspiracy-theory-misinterprets-goals-of-gates-foundation/,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/qanon-supporters-and-anti-vaxxers-are-spreading-a-hoax-that,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html,https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/population/index.html",Conspiracy Insta post misrepresents Gates interview in false claims,,,,,,

Collectively the posts have been viewed more than 80,000 times,  have been shared over 3,000 times and have attracted more than 150 comments. A Facebook post claims to show “survival rates” of COVID-19 in certain countries. The AnalysisAmid lockdowns, significant societal changes and daily updates on COVID-19 infections and deaths dominating news bulletins, the May 18 Facebook post suggests there has been an overreaction and lists “survival rates” in certain countries as evidence.Posts purporting to cite statistics that show how many people have not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have been circulating on social media since at least April.AAP FactCheck found an April 24 Twitter post that uses many of the numbers included in the May 18 Facebook post. However that post reads “Instead of death numbers, let’s look at LIFE numbers. Here’s the percentage of [sic] population that have not died with COVID:“Belgium   99.944%Spain:      99.956%Italy:        99.957%France     99.965%UK           99.972%NL           99.975%Sweden   99.980%”The numbers aren’t attributed to a source and how they are calculated is not explained.In Belgium, 6,490 people had died by April 24, according to Our World In Data figures. That figure is equal to the proportion said to have died (0.056%) in the post, indicating the calculation may be based on the number of deaths as a percentage of the population of Belgium.Such a calculation is not meaningful, as explained by an epidemiologist below.The April 24 tweet and the May 18 Facebook post use many of the same numbers, however the numbers are not assigned to the same countries. While they share the same numbers for Spain, Italy, France and the UK, the percentages listed as the “survival rates” for the Netherlands (99.975%) and Belgium (99.944%) in the tweet appear as the rates for Russia and Germany in the Facebook post.The May 18 Facebook post also shows a percentage beside a US flag. The same unattributed figure also appears in a May 1 Facebook post.From the April tweet to the May 18 Facebook post the meme has changed, with different countries listed for the same numbers, the US added, and  the percentages claimed as “survival rates” in the latter version, rather than a percentage of population who “have not died from COVID19”.Survival rates and the percentage of the population who have not died are two very different numbers, according to Professor Robyn Lucas, head of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University.“They are using the whole population, rather than the number who have diagnosed infection. So this is not really ‘survival’ – to survive a disease you have to have the disease in the first place,” Prof Lucas told AAP FactCheck in an email.If a “survival rate” for COVID-19 was to be calculated it would be by dividing the number of people who survived infection by the number who have had the illness, said Prof. Lucas. But even then there will be variability based on the definition of the group that has had the illness.“Is it the number diagnosed with the illness, the number hospitalised with the illness, or the number who probably have the illness (i.e. including those we think are asymptomatic)?” Prof Lucas said.Depending on which group is used, she said, “you will get vastly different results”. A post purporting to show the survival rate for COVID-19 has a number of problems.","https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-deaths-covid-19,http://archive.is/4rfLb,http://archive.vn/t4Aax,http://archive.vn/6wzMz,http://archive.is/yrXux,http://archive.is/2YrzU,http://archive.is/sBLZg,http://archive.is/4rfLb,http://archive.is/JA5eI,http://archive.is/4rfLb,https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=BEL~,http://archive.is/4rfLb,http://archive.is/Gb0h7,http://archive.is/4rfLb,http://archive.is/deOp7,https://rsph.anu.edu.au/research/centres-departments/national-centre-epidemiology-population-health",“Survival rates” claim isn’t part of the COVID-19 equation,,,,,,

The post reads, “NZ Did you know? 3 yrs ago NZ had the best debt to GDP ratio among developed countries. Today NZs (sic) in the same debt position as Zimbabwe & South Sudan. In just 3 years!! Bottom line is if Ardern gets another term NZ WILL become the poorest developed country on earth.#nzpol”. The post is accompanied by a comment of “Wow… ouch…”.The original Twitter post links to a Newshub Politics article headlined, “Budget: Govt expected to post eye-watering deficits for foreseeable future.”The May 18 post has been viewed more than 21,000 times, drawn more than 220 reactions and has been shared more than 150 times. A Facebook post compares New Zealand’s debt position to Zimbabwe and South Sudan. The AnalysisAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand government handed down its 2020 national budget on May 14 in what Treasurer Grant Robertson described as a plan to  “recover and rebuild”.Due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the government’s Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 (page 28) forecasts gross debt of 33.9 per cent of GDP in 2020, compared to 27.8 per cent in 2019, with the figure reaching 58.5 per cent by 2024. NZ’s net debt is forecast to be 30.2 per cent of GDP for 2020, up from an actual net debt of 19 per cent of GDP for 2019.Government debt can be expressed as gross or net debt. In general terms, gross debt is the total value of borrowings or debt owed by a government, while net debt is the gross debt minus the assets the government  holds. New Zealand uses a measure of net debt called net core Crown debt.The Facebook post claims that “three years ago” NZ had the best debt-to-GDP ratio among developed countries. According to International Monetary Fund figures from 2017, NZ did indeed have the lowest net debt at 4.65 per cent of GDP. NZ’s gross debt for the same year was 26.4 per cent of GDP. Comparatively, among developed countries as defined by the UN report “World Economic Situation and Prospects” (see table A page 145), the IMF figures show Luxembourg (23%), Bulgaria (23.9%) and Estonia (8.7%), all had lower gross debt percentages.The post also claims that today NZ is in the same debt-to-GDP position as Zimbabwe and South Sudan.In 2017, Zimbabwe’s gross debt was 78.36 per cent of GDP, according to the IMF, while  South Sudan’s gross debt was 66 per cent. The IMF does not collate net debt figures for Zimbabwe and South Sudan.The IMF, using 2018 data, projected Zimbabwe’s gross debt at 70.78 per cent of GDP for 2020.The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported in January 25, 2019, that a United Nations Conference for Trade and Development report stated Zimbabwe’s gross debt-to-GDP ratio had risen to 94 per cent in 2018 and was expected to hit 117 per cent in 2020.Concerning South Sudan, a report by the African Development Bank Group on the nation’s economic outlook for the period 2018-2021 stated: “The country is in debt distress, due to high and extra budgetary spending. Financing the fiscal deficit, primarily through loans, has reduced debt sustainability with total debt at 41.7% of GDP in March 2019.”  Figures for its current debt level were difficult to determine, although the World Bank noted in its economic update on South Sudan in April that it “remains among the poorest countries in the world and four out of five South Sudanese still live below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day. Hyperinflation, high debt burden, distortions in the foreign exchange rate market, challenges in budget execution, as well as sub-national conflict further exacerbate the situation”.The Facebook post includes a URL for a May 14 Newshub story about the 2020 budget. It includes the line: “Just a few months ago New Zealand had one of the lowest debt ratios in the world – now it’s in line with Zimbabwe and China” but does not mention South Sudan. Leading NZ economist Cameron Bagrie, of Bagrie Economics, is quoted elsewhere in the Newshub story however he told AAP FactCheck that information relating to Zimbabwe and China had not come from him.Mr Bagrie said comparing NZ’s debt to GDP position with Zimbabwe or South Sudan was “ridiculous”.“It’s like comparing a potato with a kiwifruit,” he told AAP FactCheck. “It’s also factually incorrect to say NZ is in the same position as Zimbabwe.” New Zealand’s net debt is forecast to be 30.2 per cent this year, according to government figures.","http://archive.today/BZI5v,http://archive.vn/h1f9s,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/05/budget-2020-next-generation-will-pay-price-as-government-expected-to-post-eye-watering-deficits-for-foreseeable-future.html%20http://archive.today/QAZfd,https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/budget-speech/budget-speech-2020-html,https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-05/befu20_1.pdf,https://bizfluent.com/info-8770863-net-debt-vs-gross-debt.html,https://figure.nz/chart/FfzTlACePvCPAS1I,http://archive.today/AMON5,https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf,http://archive.today/AMON5,http://archive.today/4fu3C,http://archive.today/Lv9Zn,http://archive.today/KaLUk,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/02/south-sudan-economic-analysis-shows-growth-promise-amid-fragility,http://archive.today/QAZfd,https://bagrieeconomics.co.nz",Is New Zealand’s debt level really comparable to Zimbabwe’s?,,,,,,

Accompanied by photographer Per-Anders Pettersson, Jolie’s two-day visit was to assess the security situation of camps in Chad housing refugees from Sudan’s troubled Darfur region.In an article published on the SOS Children’s Villages International website, Ms van den Broek tells how she and Jolie learned of a seven-year-old boy who needed help. They found the boy sitting on his own near his family’s tent, naked and tied to a pole at the ankle.The boy’s mother explained that when her son was three and the family was in war-torn Darfur, a plane dropped a bomb on neighbour’s house. His mother fled with him and her four other children to Chad. While living in a refugee camp the boy had tried to run away and injured himself. His mother, unable to do anything else, was forced to restrain him. Mr Pettersson captured the moment Jolie embraced the boy. The image can be seen on his website.In two interviews with Newsweek (March 25, 2007 and March 10, 2017) Jolie spoke about meeting the boy. “As a first reaction you want to remove (the rope). But the mother, she has four other kids, she’s by herself. Therapists visit him, but if (he’s) left alone he will disappear or bang himself,” she told the magazine.Regarding the use of his photo in the Facebook post, Mr Pettersson told AAP FactCheck in an email: “That is my image and it seems like it has been an unauthorised usage. I can’t take any action in this matter as this specific image is controlled and distributed by Getty Images and Angelina Jolie. The reproduction of the image is not allowed.“Cropping and giving a false representation of the original image is not a nice thing. Unfortunately, people who like to do these things do it – it’s hard to stop it.”A spokesperson for Getty Images confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email that the company distributed the full version of the picture, including “the boy’s tethered ankle, with an accompanying caption that accurately described the scene”.UNHCR spokesman for West & Central Africa Romain Desclous told AAP FactCheck via email: “It is our view that the FB post featuring a photograph of Ms Jolie at the Oure-Cassoni camp in eastern Chad is misleading and that there never were any efforts to hide anything as such by UNHCR nor by Ms Jolie, as the post appears to insinuate.” Angelina Jolie visited Chad’s Oure Cassoni refugee camp as UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in 2007.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=239514450458051&set=a.100316387711192&type=3&theater,https://www.unhcr.org/en-au/news/latest/2007/2/45e4603e2/angelina-jolie-visits-camp-chad-assess-situation-darfur-refugees.html,http://www.peranderspettersson.com/biography/,https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/news/darfur-refugees-children-with-silent-souls,https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan/Conflict-in-Darfur,http://www.peranderspettersson.com/assignments/chad--angelina-jolie/RPChad001/,https://www.newsweek.com/last-word-angelina-jolie-96073,https://www.newsweek.com/qa-angelina-jolie-refugees-and-fame-95899,https://www.newsweek.com/qa-angelina-jolie-refugees-and-fame-95899",Facebook post of Angelina Jolie and young boy is not the full picture,,,,,,

Here u go 3 new towers with radiation warnings on them installed in front of a college, safe to go back to school now.”The photo in the Facebook post shows two power poles carrying mobile phone base station antennas on the left side of a road, with a third pole, also mounted with antennas, obscured by a tree further along. The poles are in front of a sign that reads “The Hills College” and bears the logo of the NSW TAFE technical colleges.The Facebook post has been shared over 990 times, viewed over 50,000 times and attracted over 500 comments. A Facebook post claims mobile phone towers photographed on a roadside are recently installed. The AnalysisClaims of a link between the current COVID-19 pandemic and 5G telecommunications technology have increased during the disease outbreak. Protests against 5G in Melbourne and northern New South Wales recently resulted in people being arrested for breaking social distancing regulations. In the UK conspiracy theories have resulted in phone towers being attacked.A recent Parliamentary Report acknowledged misinformation spread on social media about 5G has damaged how communities perceive the technology.“Community confidence in 5G has been shaken by extensive misinformation preying on the fears of the public spread via the internet, and presented as facts, particularly through social media,” the report reads.Despite experts and government agencies having addressed and debunked theories linking COVID-19 with 5G networks, social media users are still railing against the technology.The May 15 Facebook post claims that “3 new towers with radiation warnings on them” have been installed in front of a college. The post features a photo of two clearly visible cell tower masts and a third obscured by trees. The masts are circled, while a sign for “The Hills College” has an arrow pointing to it.AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims seeking to correlate telecommunications rollouts with virus outbreaks or claiming long-standing phone towers are 5G towers erected during the coronavirus lockdown.AAP FactCheck has traced the location of the image the May 15 post to the TAFE NSW campus on Old Northern Rd, Baulkham Hills, in Sydney’s north-western suburbs.Google Street View shows the three telco masts located in front of the campus in photos taken in 2009 (see two different angles here and here) – more than nine years before the post claimed they were “new”.In an email to AAP FactCheck a Telstra spokesperson confirmed that the two towers closest to the Hills campus sign are owned by the telco company and have been on site since 2006 and 2007 respectively. The third tower is from another provider, a Telstra spokesperson said.The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Site Location Map lists telecommunications masts around the country.The map shows a Telstra site, numbered 900772 at the address of the phone towers in the photo – 146-160 Old Northern Rd, Baulkham Hills.

Can you see the rings going around the 5G tower? That is the radiation that it will give off.”He then points to a purple circular symbol and says “lo and behold, above it, is the sign for coronavirus. Can you see it?

The note features an image of celebrated British painter J.M.W. Turner and includes a number of references connected to Turner and his art.The video’s claim of a “5G tower” and its “radiation” are in fact a “large see-through window with a blue and gold foil on the front depicting Margate lighthouse and Turner Contemporary (gallery)“, according to the Bank of England.In a press release, Turner Contemporary gallery director Victoria Pomery says the painter was a “regular visitor to Margate in his lifetime.” He also produced a number of paintings of the town in southeast England, often including the lighthouse.The video’s second claim is the banknote features the “sign for coronavirus”, a purple circular symbol featuring the letter ‘T’. According to the Bank of England, the symbol represents the staircase at London’s Tate Britain art gallery by architectural firm Caruso St John.What the video claims are a “5G tower” and “coronavirus symbol” are in fact some of the £20 note’s security measures, introduced to protect against counterfeiting, the Bank of England says. British artist J M W Turner’s self-portrait is part of the £20 banknote’s new design.","https://www.facebook.com/100012853034531/videos/vb.100012853034531/910715912700168/?type=2&video_source=user_video_tab,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/february/turner-20-enters-circulation,https://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/jmw-turner/joseph-mallord-william-turner-1775-1851-r1141041,https://turnercontemporary.org/,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/february/turner-20-enters-circulation,https://turnercontemporary.org/news/10/10/2019/thenew20turnercontemporary/,https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-margate-beach-scenes-245619,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/february/turner-20-enters-circulation,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/17/tate-britain-reworking-staircase-architecture,https://www.carusostjohn.com/,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/banknotes/take-a-closer-look.pdf?la=en&hash=E8C27D561C2F99570FEADE4327974856C86396A9#page=9","There are no 5G, COVID-19 ‘secrets’ in new £20 banknote",,,,,,

The camera then turns to a piece of circuit board he is holding. In the upper left corner of the board is a silver component with a label on it that reads “COV.19”. The man then says: “This is a piece of f…ing 5G kit and it says COV-19 on it. I don’t really know of any product or any company that produces circuitry like this, but that’s the brand name, COV-dot-19”. He then goes on to claim while panning the camera up at an unidentified telecommunications tower:  “I’m not a f…ing conspiracy theorist, obviously I’ve read all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19, but why the f… are they putting circuitry like that in towers like that?” The caption on the video reads: “Covid-19 circuit boards being installed in 5G towers yeah ok” with two laughing emojis.The May 14 Facebook video has been viewed over 160,000 times, been shared over 10,000 times and attracted over 950 likes. A still image from the video has appeared in a Facebook post here and the video appears on Instagram here A still from a video in which a man claims to be a 5G installer with a component labelled “COV.19”. The AnalysisThe 5G network is the fifth generation of cellular mobile networks. The technology allows for faster data transfers, lower latency and will allow the connection of more devices to a mobile network at any one time. Telco companies including Telstra are currently rolling out 5G networks around capital cities in Australia, while a recent Parliamentary Report into the technology declared it will underpin a fourth industrial revolution in this country. During the COVID-19 crisis conspiracy theories seeking to connect the virus to the rollout of 5G technology have spread on social media networks. The theories have been debunked by experts and government agencies, but phone masts have still been attacked in the UK and other parts of Europe. The man in the May 14 video presents himself as an installer of 5G equipment at an unidentified location. The man, who wears a face mask, hardhat and hi-vis jacket, has a British accent and stands beside a blue van. Across a road, on the far side of a brick wall, is a telecommunications tower. The man claims he has been “installing 5G masts on towers” despite masts and towers being different support structures used in telecommuncations networks.During the one minute video the man waves around a piece of blue electronic circuit board that has on it a component labelled with a sticker that reads “COV.19”. He says: “this is a piece of 5G kit and it says COV 19 on it”. Through initial comments on the post and then by further research, AAP FactCheck identified the circuit board in the video as a component used in a Virgin Media (UK) pay-TV set top box. Virgin Media told AAP FactCheck in an email the component looks like a piece of hardware used in a set-top box, the Cisco 4585 HD (non-PVR) set top box, issued around nine years ago.“That is a board from a very old set top TV box and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19. It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G,” a Virgin Media spokesperson said. There are other signs that the component featured in the video is not what it’s claimed to be and is in fact from a set top box. At the 13-second mark the video shows the circuit board has a SCART connector –  a 21 pin connector used to connect visual/audio equipment and an RF cable-in connector, a standard connector for a coaxial cable, as seen on the back of this Cisco set top box on the left of the image.At 59 seconds into the Facebook video, the marking “Hannstar J MV-1” is clearly visible at the bottom of the piece of hardware. HannStar Display Corporation is a Taiwanese company that manufactures components for computer monitors, televisions and notebook displays.The last few frames of the video also show a what appears to be a disassembled black casing on the bonnet of the blue van. The casing  resembles that of a set top box or similar device.  A piece of circuit board seen in a Facebook video is not from a telecommunications tower.","http://archive.is/HsZVh,http://archive.is/oyV0n,https://web.archive.org/web/20200515050255/https://www.facebook.com/aatgmail/videos/3520974574636549/,https://web.archive.org/web/20200515050255/https://www.facebook.com/aatgmail/videos/3520974574636549/,http://archive.today/d0dnu,http://archive.today/PQKQO,https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-5g,https://www.telstra.com.au/coverage-networks/our-coverage,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Communications/5G/Report,http://archive.is/WNa7A,http://archive.is/UsQ24,http://archive.is/1ar3B,http://archive.is/HsZVh,http://archive.is/oyV0n,https://web.archive.org/web/20200515050255/https://www.facebook.com/aatgmail/videos/3520974574636549/,http://www.australianradiotowers.com/masts-and-towers/,https://www.virginmedia.com/corporate,http://cdn-docs.av-iq.com/dataSheet/Cisco-4585DVB_Datasheet.pdf,http://archive.is/mfPL4,https://bazar.bg/obiava-25034321/cisco-4585dvb-v-box-hd-virgin-media-priemnik,http://archive.is/wAMb2","A circuit board with a “COV.19” sticker is from an old pay TV box, not a 5G tower",,,,,,
197,,,,Partly False,,2020-05-15,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/china-is-not-the-only-source-of-serious-viral-outbreaks-around-the-world/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementWhile debate continues on the origin of COVID-19, a social media post has emerged to blame China as the source of a series of deadly viruses that have spread around the world since 1957.A Facebook post from May 10 features a caricature of China’s president Xi Jinping looking over rows of coffins, all of which are draped with various national flags. Next to the picture is a timeline of eight viral outbreaks from 1957 to 2019 which reads: “1957-1958 – H2N2 originated in China. 1968-1969 – H3N2 originated in China. 1997-2004 – H5N1 originated in China. 2003 – SARS originated in China. 2006 – Bird Flu originated in China. 2009 – Swine Flu originated in China. 2013 – Porcine Pestivirus originated in China. 2019 – Covid-19 originated in China.”The post’s accompanying text states: “Anyone else see a pattern? Question. Why does the world feel the constant need to kowtow to the Nation that has some of the worst Human Right Violations on the Planet, is one of the worst polluters, has delusions of global dominance (See Belt and Road Initiative) and keeps exporting viral disease after viral disease around the world?”The post by New Zealand Facebook group, South Island Independence Movement, is one of at least 13 examples found here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here by AAP FactCheck. The post’s multiple examples have attracted nearly two million views and more than 3200 shares. A Facebook post blames China for being the source of a series of deadly viral oubreaks since 1957. The AnalysisCOVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan in China in December 2019 and has now spread to 216 countries, areas or territories as of May 14, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 4.2 million cases have been confirmed and the global death toll is approaching 300,000.COVID-19 is not the first deadly viral outbreak to have originated in China, with the country correctly identified in the post as the source of several of the listed outbreaks. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that affected 26 countries in 2003 originated in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002, while the H5N1 virus – or “bird flu” – was first discovered in a goose in the same Chinese province in 1996, according to WHO.However, not all the viruses in the post can be directly attributed to China. The H2N2 virus of 1957-58 – more commonly known as ‘Asian Flu’ – was the first major worldwide influenza outbreak since the devastating Spanish Flu of 1918. The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the H2N2 virus was first reported in Singapore in February 1957 before spreading to Hong Kong in April and then to the US and other countries in June.The CDC and WHO also rule out China as the source of the 2009 Swine Flu outbreak. Passed to humans from pigs, the first infections were detected in the United States and Mexico in April and by June the disease had spread to more than 70 countries.There are also discrepancies about the origin country for other viruses listed. The H3N2 virus of 1968-69 is more commonly known as ‘Hong Kong Flu’ and while some researchers believe it may have originated in mainland China, it has never been proved conclusively. WHO (see table, page 41) lists Asia as the source. As the name suggests, it resulted in a large epidemic in Hong Kong, which at the time was a UK colony.The Facebook post lists as separate events, “1997-2004 – H5N1” and “2006 – Bird Flu”, however this is not correct as they are the same virus. Those events were part of an ongoing series of infections in animals and humans from the H5N1 virus first identified in China in 1996, confirmed with human infections in Hong Kong in 1997 and continued through to 2006.For the “2013 – Porcine Pestivirus”, it is unclear what this refers to. Pestiviruses are RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae, but the only one to have been designated “porcine” is Atypical Porcine Pestivirus (APPV). APPV is highly diverged from other members of the genus and was first identified in the US in 2015. A National Center for Biotechnology study in 2017 identified cases of APPV in Austria between 2013-2016. The World Health Organization lists the US not China as the source of the 2009 Swine Flu outbreak.","http://archive.is/y6quV,http://archive.is/qK8pn,https://www.facebook.com/Aussietothecore/photos/a.160943847857683/593497277935669/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=256372942438975&set=a.110463650363239&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158002023942655&set=a.10151396522042655&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=556269545031031&set=gm.2802804239817452&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217769164240525&set=a.4302137871355&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2956976271084429&set=a.119465391502212&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157407645176452&set=a.10153446910166452&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10222883290929095&set=a.2357584497335&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2626246390926707&set=a.2367174176833931&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218361219875394&set=a.2206145906714&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=230326851575271&set=gm.3423291341033569&type=3&theater,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,http://archive.is/MuqPm,https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/,https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/h5n1_avian_influenza_update20140714.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291411/,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html,https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/about_disease/en/,https://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_24/en/,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427756/,https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/whocdscsredc991.pdf,https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/h5n1_avian_influenza_update20140714.pdf,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/1/07-010107.pdf?ua=1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/flaviviridae,https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/virus-families/flaviviridae.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393339/,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393339/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303955612_Presence_of_atypical_porcine_pestivirus_APPV_genomes_in_newborn_piglets_correlates_with_congenital_tremor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5217315/",China is not the only source of serious viral outbreaks around the world,,,,,,

The post declares, “US company Black & Decker leaving China and building 90 million dollar plant in Texas!!!”.Agenda 21 AustraliaCOP 2030/Politics accompanied the post with a comment: “Yay hallelujah COME ON AUSSIES US NEXT…HOW ABOUT HOLDEN Say no to chinese products! Boycott China and save the planet Earth!”The group’s post has been viewed almost 19,000 times and attracted more than 230 shares and 790 reactions. A Facebook post claims US firm Black & Decker is leaving China and building a $90m plant in Texas. The AnalysisToolmaker Stanley Black & Decker announced on May 15, 2019 it was expanding its US manufacturing operations with a new 39,483 square-metre, $90 million manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas.At the time of the announcement (pre-COVID-19), the new plant was expected to be completed in late 2020 and projected to employ about 500 full-time employees to manufacture a range of Craftsman tools.Stanley Black & Decker purchased the US brand Craftsman from struggling retailer Sears in 2017. Illinois-based Sears produce the tools offshore in China to save money. Stanley Black & Decker said newer technology in the Texas plant would keep production costs in line with those in China, according to The Wall Street Journal. Stanley Black & Decker president and CEO Jim Loree said: “When we purchased Craftsman in 2017 we were determined to revitalise this iconic US brand and bring back its American manufacturing heritage.”In August 2018, Stanley Black & Decker launched Craftsman as a refreshed brand, unveiling more than 1200 products – 40 per cent of which were American-made. Loree told financial news website TheStreet the goal was to produce about 70 per cent of Craftsman’s tools in the US over the next few years.Stanley Black & Decker employs 61,000 people in more than 60 countries and operates the world’s largest tools and storage business in addition to the world’s second largest commercial electronic security company. The Connecticut-based firm operates approximately 30 manufacturing facilities in the United States, with more than 100 manufacturing facilities globally.Stanley Black & Decker chief financial officer Donald Allan Jr. provided several details of the company’s China operations in a March 2020 news article which outlined the early impact of COVID-19 on the company’s spring roll-out of tools and other products.Mr Allan said Stanley Black & Decker’s supply chain in China accounts for 40 per cent of the company’s capacity, equal to $US2.5 billion of parts, components and finished goods. The figure includes vendors that provide parts and components for manufacturing and assembly in the US and Europe and products made in China and shipped to the US and Europe. A Stanley Black & Decker document from 2018 lists 22 subsidiaries in China.Regarding the Facebook post, Shannon Lapierre, Stanley Black & Decker’s Vice President and Chief Communications Officer told AAP FactCheck in an email the company was not leaving China. “We are and will continue to operate in China, and have manufacturing operations all around the world.”Ms Lapierre told AAP FactCheck the information in the post was “not a comment that came from our company”. Trade tensions between China and the US have continued to escalate during the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://www.facebook.com/131534187573751/posts/509554073105092,https://www.facebook.com/conservativepoliticstoday/photos/a.332046377289890/920959908398531/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/dansessionsmorris/posts/2983328685039194?__tn__=-R,https://www.facebook.com/1350297198374367/posts/3681815285222535,https://www.facebook.com/politicsagenda21/photos/a.673847132726355/2737718253005889/?type=3&theater,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/article/stanley-black-decker-announces-opening-new-craftsman-plant-fort-worth-texas,https://www.craftsman.com/,https://www.americanmanufacturing.org/blog/entry/stanley-black-decker-makes-good-on-its-promise-to-reshore-more-craftsman-pr,https://www.sears.com/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/stanley-to-make-more-craftsman-tools-in-u-s-11557919800,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/article/stanley-black-decker-announces-opening-new-craftsman-plant-fort-worth-texas,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stanley-black-decker-ceo-taking-craftsman-from-sad-shape-to-made-in-america-14681930,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/article/stanley-black-decker-announces-opening-new-craftsman-plant-fort-worth-texas,https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2019/05/15/toolmaker-stanley-black-decker-brings-new-plant-and-hundreds-of-jobs-to-north-fort-worth/,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-leadership/donald-allan-jr,http://archive.vn/bZQvF,https://www.courant.com/business/hc-biz-stanley-black-decker-china-coronavirus-20200304-zbabzuazx5aqbdsgr4uca7tmbe-story.htm,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/sites/stanleyblackanddecker.com/files/subsidiaries_of_stanley_black_decker.pdf,https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/who-we-are/our-leadership/shannon-l-lapierre",Drilling into the facts about US toolmaker Black & Decker and China,,,,,,
199,,,,,,2020-05-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/the-story-about-an-unmarked-police-car-and-calling-112-has-been-around-the-block-a-few-times/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post is gaining attention with a frightening tale about a woman who was supposedly followed by a fake unmarked police vehicle but escaped danger by remembering a warning from her parents. The May 5 Facebook post claims all “AUSTRALIAN FEMALES” need to be told a story about “Chloe”, who was purportedly driving on a Queensland road “when an UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put its lights on”. The post goes on to say that Chloe’s parents had “told her never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road,” but wait until she could pull over at a “service station, police station or even a McDonalds”. According to the story, Chloe dials “112” on her phone and is connected to an emergency dispatcher and explains her situation. The dispatcher then tells Chloe “to keep driving, remain calm and that he has “back-up already on the way”. The story concludes with four police cars surround Chloe’s car and the unmarked car. When police grab the occupant of the unmarked car he is revealed to be “a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes”. The post states “Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a ‘safe’ place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them”.The post finally claims: “Let your friends know about 112 (112 is an emergency number on your mobile that takes you straight to the police because 000 does not work if you have no signal).”The May 5 Facebook post has been shared over 19,000 times, attracted over 3,500 comments and been viewed over 2.1m times. A post tells a tale of “Chloe” escaping danger by dialling 112 when tailed by a fake police car. The AnalysisThe post claims “Chloe” was “driving to visit a friend at Southport”, which is on Queensland’s Gold Coast, from Toombul, a suburb of the Queensland capital Brisbane.The Queensland Police Service (QPS) told AAP FactCheck the Queensland the story in the May 5 Facebook post is a hoax which has been repeated in various forms on the internet.“We have had enquiries relating to the story from back in 2015,” the QPS spokesperson said in response to an email inquiry.AAP FactCheck has found other versions of the story circulating in the early to mid-2000s. US fact-checkers Snopes investigated a similar story about “Lauren” from Virginia in the United States. The article also mentions a version of the story which was translated into an Australian setting. The QPS spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that “any motorist who believes an unmarked vehicle attempting to intercept them is not a police vehicle is urged to phone Policelink on 131 444 or if they fear for their safety, they should call Triple Zero (000)”.Note that Policelink is a Queensland-specific number.The May 5 post also claims that the “112” number dialled by Chloe goes “straight to the police, because 000 does not work if you have no signal”. Australia’s emergency numbers are managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). An ACMA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that both “000” and “112” work as emergency numbers provided the caller is an area that has some network coverage, even if the coverage is not from the caller’s service provider.“Your call to 000 or 112 will be carried on any other available mobile network that has coverage for your location,” the ACMA spokesperson said. If there is no network coverage it is not possible to place an emergency call. “The coverage is the critical thing — if there’s no coverage, then no mobile will work,” Chris Althaus from the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association told the ABC in 2017. 112 is the international standard emergency number, according to the Department of Transport, Regional Development and Communications. Calls made to 000 or 112 are both handled by Telstra operators, who connect you with your requested emergency service, the ACMA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck. The post also states: “Police have to respect your right to keep going to a ‘safe’ place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge them.” In response to the claim QPS told AAP FactCheck that if motorists find themselves in a similar situation to the story in the May 5 Facebook post they should: • Stop at a place they feel safe, such as a well-lit area or an area with other people• Keep their doors locked and windows closed• Request to see the person’s police identification; and• Advise the person they are calling police to verify their identity. A Facebook post tells a scary story about a woman pursued by a fake unmarked police car.","http://archive.is/GwPTQ,http://archive.is/GwPTQ,https://www.police.qld.gov.au/,http://archive.is/wip/lvmpf,http://archive.is/GwPTQ,https://www.acma.gov.au/,http://archive.is/Vh1wf,http://archive.is/SsLyw,https://www.communications.gov.au/what-we-do/phone/emergency-call-services/emergency-calls",Story about an unmarked police car and calling “112” has been around the block a few times,,,,,,

It has been shared more than 80 times, including by Facebook users in Papua New Guinea and the United States, and has been viewed more than 17,000 times.The post includes a photo of a printed page, held inside a plastic sleeve, that makes several unsupported claims about COVID-19, starting with a claim “coronavirus is fake”.The text claims COVID-19 “was a huge cover up” to allow the building of 5G telecommunications towers “which are the real cause for the virus deaths”. It claims 5G towers “are releasing extreme amounts of radiation to your body through your phone signal!”The text also claims 5G technology “will also give the government access to your information and location through an R.F.I.D. chip in the vaccine”.No references or attributions are given for any of the claims. A Facebook post makes false claims attempting to link the COVID-19 pandemic to 5G technology. The AnalysisClaims of COVID-19 being a government conspiracy or connected to 5G technology are among thousands of pieces of misinformation on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is the name of the infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The illness spread to almost every country in the world in the first months of 2020 and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11. As of May 8 there are confirmed cases across 187 countries and territories (including a cruise ship) according to a database maintained by Johns Hopkins University.The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is part of a family of coronaviruses which have caused infectious diseases such as MERS and SARS. All three strains, known as betacoronaviruses, have their origins in bats.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported many of the early patients with the disease in Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, were linked to a large seafood and live animal market, which suggested animal-to-person transmission of the disease.The World Health Organization’s (WHO) May 7, 2020 situation report said there were 3,672,238 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, and there have been 254,045 deaths.As well as the health impacts of the pandemic, the economic cost is set to be in the order of $2 trillion globally, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development.Considering the global spread of the disease, the numbers of deaths,  economic impact and the multinational mobilisation of resources to fight the pandemic there is no basis for any claim the COVID-19 pandemic is “fake”.Regarding the post’s claim that COVID-19 was “a cover up” to allow rollout of 5G network towers that are “the real cause” of the deaths occurring worldwide, to date 5G is available in only 33 or 34 countries, according to recent reports.As stated above, COVID-19 is currently in 187 countries and territories and a cruise ship.Furthermore, the first country to deploy 5G was South Korea in late 2018 and yet that country’s first COVID-19 case, detected on January 20, 2020, was imported from China.The post claims 5G network towers and “extreme amounts of radiation” are “the real cause for the virus deaths”. The WHO has addressed 5G-related scares, stating viruses cannot travel on radio waves or mobile networks.The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) says the current level of 5G radiofrequency electromagnetic energy (RF EME) is well below levels at which harm to people might occur.ARPANSA, the WHO and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation (ICNIRP) agree that “there is no established scientific evidence to support any adverse health effects from very low RF EME exposures to populations or individuals”.ARPANSA spokesman Dr Ken Karipidis says the 5G network will “initially use frequencies in the current mobile phone network, then move to higher frequencies where the depth of RF EME penetration into human tissue is short. ARPANSA says no health effects are expected for radio frequency exposures below its limits and it has recommended continued research on higher frequency future technologies.As to the post’s claim that there is “an R.F.I.D. (radiofrequency ID) chip in the vaccine said to immunise you”, there is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. Health workers unload the coffin of a coronavirus victim at a cemetery in Surabaya, Indonesia.","https://covid19.who.int/,http://archive.today/Blwwb,http://archive.today/SWhUl,https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/,http://archive.today/mqtcR,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,http://archive.today/ZrrqG,http://archive.vn/EWnqA,https://www.cdc.gov/,http://archive.today/EWnqA,http://archive.today/vg2w4,http://archive.today/tfpSO,http://archive.today/dDuGl,http://archive.today/HX825,https://www.viavisolutions.com/en-us/literature/state-5g-deployments-2020-poster-chart-en.pdf,https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190912/5g/how-south-korea-built-5g-and-what-its-learning,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001801,http://archive.today/hvuSe,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-new-generation-mobile-phone-network-and-health,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-new-generation-mobile-phone-network-and-health,http://archive.today/hvuSe","False claims about COVID-19, 5G and a vaccine that doesn’t exist yet",,,,,,

No app no work.”The post then states: “I’d say that will more then (sic) likely happen to anything we walk into movies, footy, pub etc.”The post includes a screenshot of the COVIDsafe app Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) report by law firm Maddocks, which was commissioned to do the assessment by the federal Department of Health, the agency responsible for managing the app.The image highlights paragraph 3.19.4 of the PIA, which reads:“The Australian Government has also given clear indications that it will not be mandatory for any person to install or to use the App,“However, there may be a potential risk of circumstances in which a particular individual does feel pressured to download the App,“E.g. a supermarket insisting on customers showing that they are using the App before being permitted to enter the store; or an employer insisting that their employees demonstrate that they are using the App before being permitted to start or continue work,” reads the PIA.The Facebook post has been viewed over 34,000 times, shared over 300 times and received over 100 comments. A Facebook post claims there are “hidden secret rules” for the COVIDSafe tracing app. The AnalysisAs states and territories recorded decreased levels of coronavirus infections in April, the federal Department of Health released the COVIDSafe app to track potential transmissions of the virus.The app uses the bluetooth functionality in phones to track contact between users. The app registers when a user is near other people who have the app on their device. If someone contracts COVID-19 they have to consent to the data being used by health officials for contact tracing.Prime Minister Morrison told radio station 2GB that he wants as many people as possible to download the app and that the sooner Australians download the app, the sooner they can go back to the pub.The May 3 Facebook post claims the COVIDsafe app “comes with some hidden secret rules” and says supermarkets and employers could potentially refuse entry or work to people who have not installed the app.The post includes a screenshot of section 3.19.4 of the COVIDSafe app Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), described above.The Department of Health engaged law firm Maddocks to conduct the PIA, with the report aiming to “address and mitigate any identified privacy risks for the COVIDSafe app,” according to the Department of Health website.The concerns raised in the PIA about the COVIDSafe app being used to deny someone entry to their work or a supermarket are directly addressed in the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020.As part of the Biosecurity Act (2015), the federal Minister for Health can make determinations, that are necessary to prevent the spread of a disease during a biosecurity emergency period. The COVID-19 biosecurity emergency period is in force for three months from its declaration on March 18, 2020.The minister’s Biosecurity determination, in section 9(1)(a) states that a person “must not require” that another person download the app, have it in operation or consent to their data being shared.The determination, in section 9 (2)(c), prohibits a person from “refusing to allow another person to enter premises,” if that person has not downloaded the COVIDSafe app, isn’t using the app, or has not consented to uploading their data to the COVIDSafe Data Store.The determination also prohibits a person from refusing “to enter into, or continue, a contract or arrangement with another person (including a contract of employment)” or taking “adverse action (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act 2009) against another person,” if they have not downloaded the COVIDSafe app, aren’t using the app, or have not consented to uploading their data to the COVIDSafe Data Store.If someone doesn’t comply with the Biosecurity determination they may be committing a criminal offence, punishable by a maximum of five years in prison. New draft legislation set to be introduced in to parliament will turn the determination into law, outside of the the three-month biosecurity emergency period, by amending the Privacy Act (1988).The move to introduce the legislation that amends the Privacy Act (1988) comes after experts and politicians expressed concerns about how personal data is collected and stored by the COVIDSafe app.Chair of the Australian Privacy Foundation and head of UNSW Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre, David Vaile, told AAP FactCheck in an email that there are “still  unresolved issues about the application of this law to entities under state government jurisdiction” . This includes state police forces, hospitals, emergency services and local governments.In a recent development, the Department of Health is investigating a Sydney council after it reportedly ordered staff to install the COVIDSafe app on their work-issued phones.Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday, May 6 that the reported behaviour of the council, if accurate, was unacceptable “and further steps would be taken if it were not rectified immediately”.Employer group the NSW Chamber of Commerce has expressed disappointment that employers are not allowed to mandate downloading of the app for employees. Claims “hidden” rules will affect those without the COVIDSafe app are not supported by evidence.","http://archive.is/ZnKJx,http://archive.is/ZnKJx,http://archive.is/vko2k,https://www.health.gov.au/,http://archive.is/wip/OQfa9,http://archive.is/P6b9N,http://archive.is/ub4kF,http://archive.is/KhqXC,http://archive.is/wip/vdcsP,http://archive.is/ZnKJx,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment-covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment.pdf,https://www.health.gov.au/,https://www.maddocks.com.au/about,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment-covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment.pdf,http://archive.is/wip/6shNr,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480/Explanatory%20Statement/Text,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480,http://archive.is/wip/59yI5,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480,https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Documents/exposure-draft-privacy-amendment-public-health-contact-information.pdf,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00076,https://www.3aw.com.au/why-barnaby-joyce-wont-be-downloading-the-governments-covid-19-tracking-app/,http://archive.is/HWcEw,https://privacy.org.au/,http://www.cyberlawcentre.org/,https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/executive-director-david-vaile,https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/strathfield-council-unlawfully-forces-employees-to-download-the-covidsafe-app-to-work-phones/news-story/229f5a47bd61641daa52e5dd2e3f1c01,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/doorstop-interview-on-6-may-2020-about-covid-19,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/coronavirus-employers-want-power-over-covidsafe-app/news-story/8d1cc1decd2df8a875fd48bf1bd4d949",COVIDSafe app regulations say you can’t be barred from work or the shops for not downloading,,,,,,

The unnamed woman was “aware that similar methods have been used by thieves to mark out homes”, the report said. Police Scotland advised her to keep her dogs safe, however a spokesperson told Edinburgh Live that “no crime has been established and suitable advice was given”.SPCA (The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Incorporated) New Zealand told AAP FactCheck they had no knowledge of “pet tags” being used in New Zealand to mark for dog theft. “This is the first they’ve heard of it,” the spokeswoman said.NZ Police also told AAP FactCheck that there is no proof such tactics exist.“While we are aware that these type of rumours exist, we are not aware of any recent activity or sharing of this information,” a police spokeswoman said.In 2015, police told Stuff news website that the issue was “a long-running urban myth or hoax” and that “dog owners should not be alarmed by these messages as there is no foundation to the hoax”.NZ Police recommended that property owners follow their tips on protecting possessions including pets and report any suspicious activity to local police.Since 2006, all dogs registered in New Zealand for the first time are required to be microchipped except for working farm dogs. A microchip means “there is less chance of people passing off their dogs as someone else’s,” according to NZ’s Department of Internal Affairs brochure. Since 2006, all dogs registered in New Zealand for the first time are required to be microchipped.","http://archive.is/w0NDC,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/grab-and-go-code-chalkers/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colored-stickers-target-homes-dog-owners/,https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/warning-dog-owner-fife-alerts-17779162,https://www.spca.nz/about,http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/blogs/11166470/Do-dog-thieves-really-use-secret-marks,https://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/protect-property-vehicles,http://www.dogsafety.govt.nz/dogsafety.nsf/wpg_URL/Your-Council-Registration-&-Microchipping-Index!OpenDocument,http://www.dogsafety.govt.nz/dogsafety.nsf/Files/Dog-Microchipping-Brochure/$file/Dog-Microchipping-Brochure.pdf",Dog theft marker or myth?

WTH??” The post has been shared more than 500 times, received more than 170 comments and had more than 80 interactions.  A Facebook post falsely claims Woolworths employees are required to have had a flu shot. The AnalysisInfluenza is most common in Australia between April and October – the so-called “flu season” – and health authorities recommend an annual vaccination against the viral disease. Flu shots are made available for free under the National Immunisation Program to people classified as more vulnerable to suffering severe illness as a result of the flu.While people are encouraged to have flu shots, they are not mandatory for the general public.In the current COVID-19 pandemic, flu shots have been made mandatory for workers and visitors to Australian aged care facilities. The federal Minister for Aged Care stated the requirement was put in place to protect the aged care workforce and aged care residents who, being older people are particularly at risk of serious illness from the flu.The post claims that “a lady who works for Woolworths” informed the person posting that all Woolworths employees must have a flu shot before May 1 “or they will no longer be employed there!!!”.Woolworths is a supermarket group with 995 stores in Australia.A Woolworths spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that while Woolworths employees have access to an annual flu vaccination through the company, having the shot is not mandatory and a person’s employment at the company is not affected by whether they have been vaccinated. “Woolworths offers its employees free access to an annual flu vaccination through our internal health and wellbeing programs,” the spokesperson said.“While we encourage employees to take up this offer, it is in no way compulsory and would never result in termination of employment or any punitive measures against a team member.”A union representing retail workers, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) said there was no evidence of Woolworths employees being required to have a vaccine.“As far as the SDA is able to ascertain it has no evidence of mandatory flu vaccinations being required in Woolworths establishments,” a spokesman for the union told AAP FactCheck. Woolworths has confirmed it does not require employees to have been vaccinated against the flu.","http://archive.is/t6ofQ,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/flu-trends-in-australia,https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#flu-influenza-vaccines,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-restrictions-on-entry-into-and-visitors-to-aged-care-facilities_1.pdf,https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/senator-the-hon-richard-colbeck/media/aged-care-workers-must-get-flu-vaccination,http://archive.today/fJjIp,https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/,https://www.sda.org.au/",Woolworths workers are not being forced to have flu vaccinations,,,,,,

Born in the village of Mavana on the island of Vanuabalavu, he studied commerce at the University of Auckland in New Zealand before embarking on a career in Fiji’s civil service.Mr Qarase served in the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry and Public Service. He also served as chairman of the country’s first television company, Fiji Television and was a director of the Fiji Development Bank.Mr Qarase won parliamentary elections in 2001 and 2006 before he was removed from power after a military coup in December 2006. He was jailed in 2012 for abusing his office and failing to perform his duties.On April 21, the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation reported Mr Qarase had died and that the FBC was told by family members that he had been admitted to Suva’s Oceania Hospital the previous week “following a short illness”.Also on April 21, Fiji-based TV network Mai TV reported that Mr Qarase’s spokesperson confirmed the 79-year-old former prime minister’s death. The report also said he passed away at Oceania Hospital in Suva “following a short illness”.The Facebook post claims Mr Qarase died from COVID-19 but the World Health Organization reports that, as of May 3, there have been no confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in Fiji. The report lists 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Fiji and that it has been 12 days since the last reported COVID-19 case for the Pacific nation.In a statement on April 24, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said none of Fiji’s confirmed cases of coronavirus were over the age of 65.

205,,,,False –,,2020-04-30,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/did-the-last-post-originate-on-an-american-civil-war-battlefield/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementWhile many Australians celebrated Anzac Day 2020 in their driveways as a result of COVID-19 restrictions,  a Facebook post purporting to tell the history of the military bugle call the Last Post resurfaced. The April 12, 2015, Facebook post tells a story that puts the call’s origin on a battlefield in the American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865. The post tells the story of a “Captain Robert Ellicombe”, a Union officer who decided to save the life of a soldier he could hear lying wounded on the battlefield. The story follows that after Captain Ellicombe dragged the soldier back to his own lines he realised it was his own son, who had supposedly been studying music in the southern states. It goes on to state that at his son’s funeral, the captain  requested a bugler to play music he had found on a piece of paper in his son’s uniform and that composition was the Last Post.The Facebook post also lists lyrics supposedly written for the music. The 2015 Facebook post has been viewed over 2.3 million times in the last three months and shared over 32,000 times.  A Facebook post tells a tale about the Last Post bugle call originating during America’s Civil War. The AnalysisAnzac day falls on April 25, the date Australian and New Zealand forces landed at Gallipoli in 1915. The day has been commemorated since 1916, but wasn’t cemented as a tradition until the 1920s. The Last Post bugle call traditionally “symbolises that the duty of the dead is over and that they can rest in peace,” according to the Australian Parliamentary Library Anzac Day guide. On Anzac Day the bugle call is followed by one or two minutes of silence. The 2015 Facebook post claims the Last Post was born during the American Civil War, after a Captain Ellicombe of the Union Army unknowingly found his dying son on the battlefield. However, Australian War Memorial historian Dr Meleah Hampton told AAP FactCheck in an email that there are two main theories on the origin of the Last Post and neither involve the American Civil War story cited in the Facebook post. The first theory, Dr Hampton said, is that the Last Post was one of a series of bugle calls played during the day in a military camp, with the final call indicating a soldier checking sentry posts had reached the last post. The Australian Army states this theory on their website, while the Department of Defence website lists a similar description. The second theory, according to Dr Hampton, is that the bugle call originated when the English army was working its way through the Dutch low countries during the Nine Years War in the 1690s. The call was supposedly played to bring soldiers back from the pubs before bed, with the Dutch phrase for “turn off the taps” translating to “do den tap toe”. The phrase is considered to be the origins of the term “tattoo”, as in a military tattoo, Dr Hampton said. The Royal Australian Air Force and AWM website state this theory as part of the history of the Last Post. However, when it comes to knowing which theory is more likely, Dr Hampton said there is little documented evidence on the origins of the Last Post and most of the stories are based on memory and tradition.“There can be no definitive answer, no matter what Australian soldiers are or have been taught,” she said. AAP FactCheck found the story of Capt. Ellicombe circulating as far back as 2010, but also found  other versions of the story.  The other versions claim Cpt. Ellicombe’s story gave gave birth to the American bugle call named Taps, not the Last Post. However, according to Taps Historian Jari Villaneuva, the story of Capt. Ellicombe has no bearing on how the American bugle call Taps actually came into being and is a myth. Taps is the American equivalent of the Last Post and is played during military funerals and commemorative services in America. It was originally used as a signal to extinguish lights but was changed by Union Army Major General Daniel Adams Butterfield at Harrison’s Landing, Virginia, in 1862, Villanueva wrote in a US Department of Veteran Affairs paper. “Butterfield was not pleased with the call for “Extinguish Lights” feeling that it was too formal to signal the day’s end. With the help of the brigade bugler, Oliver Willcox Norton, he created “Taps” to honor his men while in camp at Harrison’s Landing, Virginia following the Seven Days’ battles during the Peninsular Campaign,” Villanueva wrote in the USDVA paper.  Many stories are told of the origins of the emotive military bugle call, the Last Post.","https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-52406944,http://archive.is/B1VOs,https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2010/spring/newnation.html,https://www.awm.gov.au/Anzacathome/Anzac-traditions,http://archive.is/4LtMN,http://archive.is/4LtMN,http://archive.is/B1VOs,https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/brief-overview-american-civil-war,https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/who-fought,https://www.awm.gov.au/,https://www.awm.gov.au/about/our-people/organisational-chart/mhs/meleah-hampton,http://archive.is/3G3i0,http://archive.is/5Mnko,https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/nine-years-war,http://archive.is/wip/USMSn,https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/customs-and-ceremony/last-post,http://archive.is/WmEK3,http://archive.is/WmEK3,https://www.americancivilwar.asn.au/meet/2006_02_mtg_origin_of_taps.pdf,http://archive.is/GEX3T,https://www.americancivilwar.asn.au/meet/2006_02_mtg_origin_of_taps.pdf,https://tapsbugler.com/,http://archive.is/RWerH,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WChTqYlDjtI,https://web.archive.org/web/20200429051911/https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/taps.pdf,https://web.archive.org/web/20200429051911/https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/taps.pdf",Did the Last Post originate on an American Civil War battlefield?,,,,,,

In total the posts have been viewed over 250,000 times and received more than 1100 shares and 500 interactions. A post claiming to show a text message from the new COVIDSafe app is gaining traction on Facebook. The AnalysisAustralia’s states and territories will consider easing COVID-19 restrictions next month after a drop in the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Amid the good news, an image claiming to be from the federal government’s new COVIDsafe app is being widely shared on Facebook.The COVIDsafe app is designed to help health officials identify people who have come into contact with somebody infected with COVID-19, according to the app’s website. Since its launch on April 26 the voluntary app has been downloaded almost three million times as of April 29, with the government expecting more than half the population to eventually become users.The April 27 post purports to show a text message linked to or generated by the COVIDsafe app, with the image reading: “The COVIDsafe App has detected you are now +20km from your nominated home address. Please register your reason for travel by calling 1300 1MY GOV (+61 1300 169 468) within 15 minutes of receiving this SMS (10:12am AEST Monday 27 April 2020). Thank you.”The Department of Health, who are responsible for maintaining the app, told AAP FactCheck in an email the Facebook post is “a hoax message” and that it was “abhorrent scammers would attempt to use the COVIDSafe app, a public health tool, to try and catch out Australians”.“The COVIDsafe app doesn’t have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people’s phones that have downloaded the app and cannot monitor a person’s location at any time,” a department spokesperson said.Experts at the University of Sydney have also stated the app cannot track location.The Australian Federal Police (AFP) told AAP FactCheck in an email they are investigating the message. “The AFP is aware of an alleged hoax involving the COVIDSafe app and is currently investigating the matter,” a spokesperson said.Politicians and doctors have come out in support of the app and encouraged Australians to use it so the federal government can wind back restrictions on movement. During an April 26 press conference the Australian chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said he would be using the app. “No Australian should have any concerns about downloading this app” he said.Not all have been in support of the app, with some federal politicians and privacy groups expressing concern.One IT expert has stated that the app delivered on the government’s promises about data security, while another has pointed to potential, albeit low-likelihood  vulnerabilities via bluetooth connection.

This particular post has been shared more than 200 times and viewed more than 19,000 times.Another post of the same image, also from April 20, has been shared more than 300 times and viewed more than 21,000 times. A Facebook post purports to show the world’s smallest bird perched on a finger. The AnalysisThe world’s smallest bird, as recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, is the zunzuncito. The tiny tweeter is only found in Cuba.It typically is less than 6cm long – half of which is taken up by the bill and the tail – and weighs less than two grams.The zunzuncito is listed as near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with its population on a decreasing trend.The photo in the Facebook post of a bird perched on a finger is not, however, a photo of the diminutive bee hummingbird/zunzuncito. It is actually a painted miniature sculpture created by an artist in Illinois in the United States.The Malinik Miniatures artist, Ina Gancheva, specialises in small reproductions of birds.“I work with polymer clay and wire to make the sculpture, and then cover it with feathers or fibers,” she states on her Facebook page. “I always try to make my creatures as realistic as possible.”The Malinik Miniatures bird in the viral photo is not even a hummingbird. Hummingbirds typically have long narrow beaks and the short-beaked miniature depicted is a replica of a chickadee.A photo of the zunzuncito shared on Flickr by photographer Rita Ivanauskas shows the actual bird’s size compared to a human hand, which, while small, is considerably larger than the viral image.The falsely represented photo has also been debunked in the past by factcheckers Snopes and AFP Factcheck, among other organisations. The chickadee appears in a Facebook post despite not being the world’s smallest bird.","http://archive.is/IT1nd,http://archive.today/8zaJj,https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/smallest-bird,https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?lang=EN&avibaseid=2AA5F01C38577FC4,https://www.audubon.org/news/get-know-bee-hummingbird-worlds-smallest-bird,https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22688214/93187682,https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/629941066607430318/,https://www.pinterest.com.au/malinik/,https://www.pinterest.com.au/malinik/my-miniature-birds-and-animals/,https://www.facebook.com/MalinikMiniatureAnimals/,https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/445152744421406788/,https://www.britannica.com/animal/chickadee,https://www.flickr.com/photos/66759404@N08/32144886492,https://www.flickr.com/people/66759404@N08/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/photo-of-zunzuncito-bird/,https://factcheck.afp.com/image-shows-handmade-miniature-not-worlds-smallest-bird",Photo of “world’s smallest bird” has a small problem,,,,,,

The text reads, “NOT an overreaction”, and compares the population figures of New Zealand (4.8 billion) and Ireland (4.9 million). It also says, “First reported cases: NZ 28th March, Ireland 29th March”, followed by “As at 18th April 2020, NZ: 1094 confirmed cases, 11 deaths” and “Ireland: 14,758 confirmed cases, 571 deaths”. It ends with the words “NOT a political game Do it right New Zealand!”The post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and generated more than 220 shares. A Facebook post compares the coronavirus statistics of Ireland and New Zealand. The AnalysisAs the world reels from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Ireland and New Zealand have implemented lockdown measures to mitigate the virus and its effects.As of April 28, Ireland had recorded 19,877 COVID-19 cases with 1,159 deaths, according to its Department of Health. New Zealand’s official figures show 1,472 confirmed and probable cases with 19 deaths as of the same date.The Facebook post provides a number of statistics, starting with population figures which are roughly accurate. The estimated population of New Zealand is 4.95 million as of December 2019, according to Statistics New Zealand, compared to the post’s figure of “4.8 million”. Ireland’s Central Statistics Office lists the Emerald Isle’s 2019 population as 4.92 million, matching the post’s “4.9 million”.The post’s claim that New Zealand’s first COVID-19 case was reported on March 28 is incorrect. AAP FactCheck found that according to New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, the first reported case was on February 28, “a person in their 60s recently returned from Iran”. Ireland’s first case, which the post dates as March 29, was detected on February 29. The date of February 28 for NZ is also supported by a World Health Organization (WHO) report, while the UN public health body lists March 1 for Ireland’s first COVID-19 case.According to Ireland’s Department of Health, as of April 18 the COVID-19 death toll in Ireland was 571, with 14,758 confirmed cases while 11 deaths and 1094 cases were recorded in NZ on the same date, WHO data showed.

209,,,,,,2020-04-28,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/nobel-prize-winning-professor-did-not-say-coronavirus-was-manufactured-in-china/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA post on Facebook claims a Nobel Prize-winning Japanese scientist has said the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease was “manufactured” by China.The April 26 Facebook post claims Japan’s Nobel Prize winning Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo “created a sensation today by saying that the coronavirus is not natural”.The post goes on to claim the professor said: “If it is natural, it wouldn’t have adversely affected the entire world like this. Because, as per nature, temperature is different in different countries. If it is natural, it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China.”The post then claims he said “It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China”.It then claims that Professor Honjo said he was “fully acquainted with the staff of that laboratory” and then purports he said “all their phones are dead” and “it is now understood that all these lab technicians have died”.The post finishes with:  “Based on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence – That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it”.AAP FactCheck found five separate iterations of the Facebook post, here, here, here, here and here. In total the posts have been viewed over 100,000 times, shared over 1,950 times and received over 1,200 interactions. A Facebook post claims Japanese Professor Tasuku Honjo said the SARS-CoV-2 virus is man made. The AnalysisAs unverified claims that COVID-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology continue to circulate, a Facebook post purports to quote Japan’s Professor Tasuku Honjo as saying “China manufactured” the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The April 26 Facebook post claims Prof Honjo said: “the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it,” and that “if (the virus) is natural , it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China”.A spokesperson from Kyoto University, where Prof Honjo, a researcher in molecular immunology, holds tenure, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the professor did not say any of the things outlined in the April 26 Facebook post. In a statement posted to the the Kyoto University website, Prof Honjo said he was saddened that his name had been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.“At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting,” the statement from Prof Honjo reads.The April 26 Facebook post claims Prof Honjo said: “I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory”.Prof Honjo has not worked at any Chinese laboratories, according to his Kyoto University biography. He studied medicine at Kyoto University, graduated with a Ph.D in medical chemistry, then took various posts at higher education institutions around Japan and fellowships in America. In 2018 Prof Honjo shared a Nobel Prize with James P. Allison for developing new immunotherapies to cancer.The April 26 post‘s mention of “the Wuhan laboratory” is evidently a reference to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), a research centre in Wuhan, China which opened that country’s  first level 4 biosafety laboratory in 2015.Since February the WIV has become the target of conspiracy theories that claim the coronavirus escaped from a lab or was a manufactured bioweapon.In recent weeks opinion articles have reignited the theories, with a claim that  circumstantial evidence points to the WIV as the source of the outbreak of COVID-19 and a report that diplomatic cables sounded the alarm about inadequate biosafety procedures at the institute.AAP FactCheck has checked similar claims about the WIV and to date found there is no evidence that directly links the Wuhan Institute of Virology with the outbreak of COVID-19.A leading Australian researcher has stated there is no evidence to support claims of SARS-CoV-2 originating in a laboratory and in March researchers published in the journal Nature Medicine reported that analysis showed “that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus”.  Tasuku Honjo arrives at Kyoto University to attend a press conference in 2018.","http://archive.is/ppjLp,http://archive.is/ppjLp,http://archive.is/MlR0F,http://archive.is/Zaxdl,http://archive.is/bZcp1,http://archive.is/Orb13,http://archive.today/Exr6d,http://archive.is/5Obdi,http://archive.is/ppjLp,https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/,http://archive.is/5Obdi,http://archive.is/aEizW,http://archive.is/aEizW,http://archive.is/ppjLp,http://archive.is/5Obdi,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/nobel-prize-facts/,http://archive.is/8066O,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/honjo/facts/,http://archive.is/ppjLp,http://english.whiov.cas.cn/About_Us2016/Brief_Introduction2016/,http://archive.is/gTqRh,http://archive.is/WaGq2,https://connect.aap.com.au/http/archive.is/vtLkI,http://archive.is/Exr6d,http://archive.is/FWaWH,https://www.aap.com.au/the-2019-coronavirus-is-not-a-man-made-combination-of-hiv-and-sars-viruses/,https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/04/16/COVID-19-statement-professor-edward-holmes-sars-cov-2-virus.html,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9",Nobel Prize-winning professor did not say coronavirus was manufactured in China,,,,,,

Barcode (sic) starting with number 890 is country code of India. Lets (sic) boycott Chinese product (sic)”.The post’s caption reads: “The time is now to rekindle Australian manufacturing, buy Aussie made and look after our own”.The post, shared by Australian users, has been viewed more than 25,000 times and received more than 450 shares. A Facebook post claims to show how people can “differentiate between Chinese and Indian products”. The AnalysisBarcodes are a part of everyday consumer life, used in everything from hardware to healthcare, supermarkets, the food industry and all kinds of trade. A barcode uses black lines to represent data, which are scanned by a barcode reader to categorise the data.The barcode system of categorising products revolutionised the way the world conducted business after being patented in America in 1952. The system transformed retail and by 1986, 90 per cent of Australian grocery items carried barcodes.Retailers around the world use Universal Product Code (UPC) and International Article Number (EAN) barcodes to carry information about their products. As part of the globalised economy, many major companies have adopted the GS1 barcoding standard for UPC/EAN and other barcodes. GS1 is a not-for-profit organisation that manages the barcode standard for products to be scanned around the world.The Facebook post purports to show how to differentiate between Chinese and Indian products based on the first three numbers on a barcode. The post is referring to a GS1 company prefix. The prefix acts as “a unique identification number” assigned to a company’s selected barcodes when they are registered in a certain country. The prefix appears in various barcode types.The post correctly lists the company prefixes for China (690-699) and India (890), however as GS1’s website states that since “member companies can manufacture products anywhere in the world, GS1 prefixes do not identify the country of origin for a given product”.A GS1 Australia spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that a GS1 prefix “is an allocation method only, nothing to do with country of origin requirements which are regulated quite differently by local regulators.”GS1 Australia regularly sees company prefix numbers that don’t match their country of origin due to more manufacturing being moved to countries outside of where a company has registered their barcodes, the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.The claims made in the Facebook post are a “recurring myth that does the rounds of the internet and social media sites every few years as China becomes part of a major news story,” the spokesperson said.“The last one was probably when melamine was found in baby formula. The current (COVID-19) crisis was always going to bring it out again.”Under the Australian Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard legislation (2016), most food sold in Australian supermarkets needs to display country of origin labelling.The labels are broken down into three groups: grown in, produced in and made in. Grown in relates to where ingredients come from. Produced in means the product makes a claim about where the ingredients come from and where the food was processed. Made in means the product makes a claim about where it was manufactured.If a food wasn’t grown, produced or made in a single country then it must identify the country where it was packed, according to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC).Products are further classified into two groups: priority foods and non-priority foods. Non-priority foods consist of seasoning, confectionary, tea, coffee, biscuits, snack food, bottled water, soft/sports drinks and alcohol. Everything else is a priority food, including fruit, vegetables, seafood and meat.If a priority food was grown, produced or made in Australia its country of origin label will display a kangaroo in a triangle and a bar chart showing the proportion of Australian content in the food.Australian Consumer Law does not require non-food products to carry country of origin labelling, but it does prohibit businesses from making false or misleading claims about where their products come from, according to the ACCC. Businesses can only make any claims about non-food goods as long as “they are clear, truthful and accurate”, the competition watchdog says. A supermarket employee uses an app to scan the barcode on a product.","http://archive.is/suh8d,https://archive.is/IDQHe,http://archive.is/T5OwW,http://archive.is/kb7hn,http://archive.is/UuRY6,http://archive.is/MLt8C,http://archive.is/5xok6,https://www.gs1.org/docs/barcodes/GS1_Barcodes_Fact_Sheet-GS_%20EAN_UPC_family.pdf,http://archive.is/8Fnnb,http://archive.is/suh8d,http://archive.is/dpH5z,https://www.gs1au.org/,http://archive.is/z1LNn,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017C00920,http://archive.is/TYOOb,http://archive.is/TYOOb,http://archive.is/TYOOb,http://archive.is/X9sQX,http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caca2010265/sch2.html#_Toc368657571,http://archive.is/cTcOi,https://www.accc.gov.au/",Barcodes post fails to crack the code on Chinese and Indian products,,,,,,

In total the posts have been viewed more than 550,000 times and generated more than 6500 shares and 1000 interactions. A Facebook post claims there is an “Aussie product aisle” at a Woolworths store in Mount Isa. The AnalysisThe Facebook post makes the claim that a great idea, “An Aussie product aisle!”, has been implemented at a Woolworths store in Mount Isa, Queensland.A Woolworths spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that Mount Isa does not have an Australian products aisle and there are no plans at this stage to introduce such an aisle into stores.“Ninety-six per cent of all our fruit and veggies are sourced in Australia and all our fresh meat is Australian grown. But no dedicated aisles as such,” the spokesperson said.The post also directs Facebook users to a Change.org petition created by an Australian user titled, “Identify Australian Made products & Aisles in shops to help Aussie manufacturing”.Change.org is a for-profit platform that hosts petitions. The website has played a role in a number of successful public advocacy campaigns in Australia, including attracting more than 80,000 signatures to stop oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight.The petition linked to the Facebook post makes no mention of Mount Isa or Woolworths, instead asking readers to picture a scenario where: “You walk into the supermarket or store you’re shopping in and you first go to the aisle that has The Australian flag above it and in here THE retailer has placed all the Australian Made and produced products that have high % of Australian produced ingredients.”Under the Australian Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard legislation (2016), most food sold in Australian supermarkets needs to display country of origin labels. Some Australian made goods will feature a kangaroo in a green triangle and a bar chart to denote the proportion of Australian content in the food.The Change.org petition includes the same photo used in the Facebook post.

212,,,,False,,2020-04-23,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/disguised-cell-towers-are-not-being-used-to-spy-on-communities/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post by a New Zealand user claims that telecommunications companies are setting up “camouflaged” cell towers to spy on communities.The April 12 post is accompanied by a photo purporting to show the construction of a cell tower disguised as a pine tree, with the caption: “If it is safe, then why do they have to hide it?”The post reads: “Now Telcos are setting up celltowers (sic) camouflaged as trees to spy on communities. No wonder people get concerned about having unwanted technology forced on us.”The post has attracted more than 44,000 views and has been shared more than 660 times. A Facebook post claims telcos are setting up “camouflaged” cell towers to spy on local communities. The AnalysisDisguising cell towers as trees dates back to the 1990s and was pioneered by Ivo Branislav Lazic of South African telecommunications company Brolaz Projects and his colleague Aubrey Trevor Thomas. According to Wired magazine, Lazic and Thomas came up with the world’s first palm tree cell phone tower, The Palm Pole Tower. The tower was made from non-toxic plastics and installed in Cape Town in 1996. The pair’s original design concealed a mobile antenna with artificial foliage, which “typically resembles the fronds and leaves of a natural palm tree.”The Facebook post by a New Zealand user and the accompanying photo makes several claims: that telecommunications companies are setting up cell towers camouflaged as trees; that this is being done to spy on communities and that the “unwanted technology” is being forced on consumers.The photo in the post gives no date, location or context. A reverse image search found the image dated back to October 22, 2014 and is featured on the website of a US company called NELLO. The Indiana-based firm describes itself as a “global leader in the design and fabrication of galvanized steel towers and poles”.On the page from which the photo is taken, more detail is given about a product called Monopine cell towers, which NELLO says is “a monopole disguised as a pine tree”. The company says they have “become increasingly popular in the last decade”.The post’s claim that telecommunications companies are setting up cell towers camouflaged as trees is true, however NELLO’s website says the popularity of monopine cell towers is due to aesthetic concerns.“Due to more stringent zoning laws and the need for more towers in densely populated areas, wireless carriers have been forced to come up with alternatives to traditional lattice towers or monopoles,” the website says.“The monopine has been a popular solution as it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to install. In addition, another benefit is that it has a small footprint and requires minimal real estate to deploy.”For the claim that telecommunications companies are using the disguised towers “to spy on communities”, AAP FactCheck sought comment from Vodafone New Zealand and industry body, the New Zealand Telecommunications Forum.Tony Baird, wholesale and infrastructure director for Vodafone NZ, told AAP FactCheck in an email: “We have approximately 1600 cell sites around New Zealand, as well as some moveable cell sites (cell sites on wheels, or COWs) that we deploy when needed to temporarily boost to mobile coverage, such as at major concerts or during COVID-19 for hospitals to support an increased use of mobile phones.“We do not disguise any cell sites as trees. This is only done for aesthetic or practical reasons, or when we can’t use a moveable cell site (COW).“As an internet services company our sole focus is on providing the best possible connectivity for our customers. We do not use cell sites for monitoring purposes, and there are no cameras or capability on cell sites to spy on people.”NZ Telecommunications Forum CEO Geoff Thorn told AAP FactCheck in a statement that cell sites have been disguised on “very rare occasions for aesthetic reasons”.“In every case, cell sites are positioned to provide cell phone and broadband connectivity for local communities.”Regarding the claim the towers are an example of “unwanted technology forced upon us”, NELLO’s website states that the monopine’s popularity has been driven by demand “in densely populated areas” forcing wireless carriers to come up with “alternatives to traditional lattice towers or monopoles”. Disguising cell towers to look like trees such as palms was first pioneered in the 1990s.","http://archive.today/Vk9Vt,http://archive.today/Yix8Y,https://patents.justia.com/inventor/ivo-branislav-lazic,http://archive.is/EC4jx,https://archive.vn/Yix8Y,http://archive.is/4kCKN,http://archive.vn/OmFQd,http://archive.today/FDHOS",Cell towers disguised as trees are not being used to spy on communities,,,,,,

The video is from a TV news report by Boston-based WCVB-TV, which the broadcaster posted on its website on the same day of the arrest.Lieber’s arrest received significant media coverage around the world, but no mention was made of coronavirus in the initial news reports. At the press conference, US Attorney for the Massachusetts district, Andrew Lelling, explained  that the charges related to the Department of Justice’s ongoing investigations into Chinese economic espionage and research. As well as Lieber’s case, Lelling also outlined charges laid against two Chinese nationals in unrelated investigations.The only apparent link between the Lieber case and the coronavirus crisis is that the charges against the US scientist relate to his relationship with the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT). The first coronavirus cases originated in the Chinese city.According to a statement issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ), Lieber – who is also the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University – has been charged with making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” in relation to his work with WUT. The DoJ allege that in 2011, unbeknown to Harvard, Lieber became a ‘Strategic Scientist’ at WUT and later became a contractual participant in The Thousand Talents Plan, a Chinese government program aimed at recruiting leading international scientists and researchers.The DoJ allege that under the terms of that contract, WUT paid Lieber $US50,000 per month, plus living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $US158,000 at the time). He was also allegedly paid more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at the university.Although Lieber’s work crosses a number of scientific fields, he works mainly in nanoscience, which involves the study of ultra small structures and materials. According to his Harvard profile, Lieber has pioneered the synthesis of a broad range of nanoscale materials and has been a leader in demonstrating their applications in areas ranging from electronics and computing to biology and medicine.Lieber’s CV states he has published more than 400 papers in peer reviewed journals. A 2004 paper titled, ‘Electrical detection of single viruses’, explored the use of nanowires to speed up the detection of viruses, according to an article in the Harvard Gazette.“Viruses are among the most important causes of human disease and are of increasing concern as agents for bioterrorism,” Lieber says in the article. “Our work shows that nanoscale silicon wires can be configured as detectors that turn on or off in the presence of a single virus particle. Such detectors could be fashioned into arrays capable of sensing thousands of different viruses, ushering in a new era for diagnoses, biosafety, and quick response to viral outbreaks.”As to the origin of COVID-19, the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found no evidence linking the virus to a laboratory, yet the theory continues to be aired by politicians such as US President Donld Trump.Lieber’s arrest in January prompted swift social media speculation that he was somehow connected to the COVID-19 outbreak. Those claims have been debunked by organisations such as Snopes, FactCheck.org, Reuters and WCVB-TV, the source of the post’s video.  Dr Charles Lieber works mainly in nanoscience, which involves the study of ultra small materials.","https://connect.aap.com.au/http/archive.vn/OaRg9,https://chemistry.harvard.edu/people/charles-lieber,https://www.wcvb.com/article/federal-charges-in-investigation-into-china-biomedical-research-infiltration/30689217,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51288854,http://archive.is/fAlce,https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/meet-us-attorney,http://english.whut.edu.cn/,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related,http://cml.harvard.edu/people/charles-m-lieber,http://chinainnovationfunding.eu/thousand-talents-plan/,https://www.science.org.au/curious/nanoscience,https://chemistry.harvard.edu/people/charles-lieber,http://cml.harvard.edu/assets/CML_CV_11Feb2020.pdf,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14017,https://cml.harvard.edu/assets/HGazette_7Oct04.pdf,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsummary.html,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/18/trump-us-investigating-whether-coronavirus-spread-china-lab/5158551002/,http://archive.is/CrNcX,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/charles-lieber-arrested-coronavirus/,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/no-link-between-harvard-scientist-charles-lieber-and-coronavirus/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-harvard-doctor-arrested-cor/false-headline-claim-harvard-doctor-arrested-for-creating-and-selling-the-new-coronavirus-to-china-idUSKBN21P292,https://www.wcvb.com/article/conspiracy-and-false-claims-surrounding-dr-charles-lieber-china-and-covid-19-coronavirus/32094143",US scientist was not arrested for selling coronavirus to China,,,,,,

It contains ethanol glycol that’s also found in anti-freeze that’s toxic to them!!”The post concludes: “They might lick the area you’ve touched them. Please share to make others aware.”The post has been viewed over 200,000 times, shared over 3,600 times and attracted more than 30 comments. A Facebook post claims hand sanitiser contains a toxic chemical used in anti-freeze. The AnalysisThe April 1 Facebook post claims that people should not touch dogs or other pets after using hand sanitiser because it “contains ethanol glycol, that’s also found in anti-freeze”.Ethanol glycol is not a real chemical compound. The post may be referring to ethylene glycol, an industrial compound found in many consumer products including antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is toxic to humans and animals, with sufficient consumption of the substance sometimes proving fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.Ethylene glycol is not used in hand sanitiser formulations. Hand sanitisers authorised for sale in Australia in the form of hand rubs contain between 60-95% alcohol as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, with small amount of other chemicals.Hand sanitisers that claim to combat viruses are regulated as “therapeutic goods” by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).“Ethylene glycol is not included as an ingredient in any hand sanitisers that are registered in the ARTG,” a TGA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck via email.Other hand sanitisers made for domestic and personal use are classified as ‘cosmetics’ and the chemicals used in them are regulated by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NINCAS).In a statement to AAP FactCheck, a NINCAS spokesperson said:  “We are unaware of any use of ethylene glycol in hand sanitisers”.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a national shortage of hand sanitiser the TGA introduced legislation that relaxed the requirements for approval of hand sanitiser formulations. The newly formulated products must follow two recipes developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Neither recipe calls for the use of ethylene glycol.University of Sydney Professor of Veterinary Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Jacqueline Norris told AAP FactCheck hand sanitiser can be dangerous for pets if they lick the substance off a person’s hands directly after they have applied the rub.“Most animals are adverse to licking hands with alcohol on it — fortunately the alcohol evaporates very quickly, but if they did (lick hand rub containing alcohol) it could cause central depression and vomiting mainly due to the high levels of alcohol,” Professor Norris said. A post claiming pets shouldn’t be patted after using hand sanitiser gets the ingredients wrong.","http://archive.is/xDOde,http://archive.is/xDOde,https://www.periodni.com/solcalc-chemical_compounds.html,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1_2-Ethanediol,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750031.html,http://archive.is/wip/ZCI9w,https://www.tga.gov.au/hand-sanitisers-and-covid-19,https://www.tga.gov.au/,http://archive.is/wip/YJe2a,https://www.nicnas.gov.au/,http://archive.is/3DO1h,https://www.who.int/gpsc/information_centre/handrub-formulations/en/,http://archive.today/slb4u,https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/jacqui-norris.html","Hand sanitiser, pets and patting post gets ingredients mixed up",,,,,,

Just herd (sic) from a source in government that the full plan is to lock us down for 3 months But easing us in with 4 weeks. Also spoke with many business owners over the past days that have received 3 months government subsidies in full already”. The post concludes: “Hope your (sic) ready for 12 weeks Lock down fam”.The post has been viewed more than 47,000 times and shared more than 170 times. A Facebook post claims “a source in government” says NZ’s lockdown will last for three months. The AnalysisThe Facebook post attempts to link the length of the national lockdown to the New Zealand government’s wage subsidies plan for businesses affected by the coronavirus.However, the two are separate issues.On March 23, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that New Zealand was moving to its highest alert level in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19. All non-essential services were closed and the country’s nearly five million citizens were asked to shelter in place for at least four weeks beginning March 25.The virus has infected more than two million people worldwide and killed more than 134,000 people as of April 16, according to the Worldometer website.New Zealand has 1,401 cases and has had nine deaths as of April 16.When the lockdown was announced, Ms Ardern said the duration of it would depend on how effective it had been. “If we after those four weeks  have been successful, we I hope will be able to ease up on restrictions. If we haven’t, we’ll find ourselves living with them for longer,” she said.More than two weeks in, New Zealand’s spread of coronavirus has apparently slowed. Recovery rates have improved and the number of new infections has dropped. New Zealand’s Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said Tuesday, April 14, that “it’s clear that we are past the peak” of new COVID-19 cases.As part of a major economic package to help New Zealand’s economy, a Wage Subsidy scheme was announced to help businesses affected by virus-related closures.The subsidy, which supports employers and their staff, is available to all businesses that have had at least a 30 per cent revenue drop due to COVID-19.The initial subsidy covers 12 weeks per employee and is paid as a lump sum.The general manager of employment for New Zealand’s Ministry of Social Development, Jayne Russell, said in a statement to AAP Factcheck that the 12-week period for the subsidy was chosen “to allow businesses time to understand the impact of COVID-19 and support them to keep their employees connected,” she said.“Decisions on the COVID-19 alert level and duration of the alert level for New Zealand are completely separate and made by the New Zealand Government,” Russell said. Police patrol empty streets in the central business district of Christchurch, New Zealand in March.","http://archive.is/GAIuz,https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/other-types-of-leave/coronavirus-workplace/wage-subsidy/,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/prime-minister-covid-19-alert-level-increased,http://archive.today/xkcWf,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/,http://archive.today/uVOiE,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/prime-minister-covid-19-alert-level-increased,http://archive.today/pmWkl,https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2020/04/14/1101216/covid-19-in-nz-the-numbers,http://archive.today/CCOo0,https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/other-types-of-leave/coronavirus-workplace/wage-subsidy/ ,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-03/Wage%20subsidy%20scheme%20factsheet.pdf",NZ’s three-month wage subsidy does not mean there will be a three-month lockdown,,,,,,

The two variations of posts have been uploaded by over 10 different Instagram accounts – including here and here – all containing links to websites selling cinchona powder. In total the posts have been viewed over 160,000 times. An Instagram post incorrectly states the synthetic drug chloroquine is made from Cinchona tree bark. The AnalysisCOVID-19 has swept across the globe with devastating effect, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands of people.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine gained prominence in March after small studies in France and China suggested administering the drug to people suffering COVID-19, sometimes in combination with another drug,  could decrease the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their system.US President Donald Trump boosted the drugs’ exposure when he called them potential “game changers” in the fight against the virus as a possible treatment for symptoms.Hydroxychloroquine has been approved in the United States as an emergency treatment for COVID-19 and Australia has also  begun importing the drug for use in hospitals.There are a number of false claims in the post, the most obvious being that chloroquine “is made from the bark of the Cinchona tree”.Chloroquine is a synthetic anti-malaria drug that was created in 1934. An article for The Conversation by a medical historian and two scientists describes chloroquine as “inspired” by the activity of quinine but with a “quite different” chemical structure to compounds found in cinchona bark.Monash Pharmaceuticals Professor Simon Bell told AAP FactCheck that Chloroquine and Hydroxchloroquine are safer and longer-acting “synthetic analogues” of quinine. “They are chemically different, which gives them different properties, but in the same general class,” he said.Quinine, used to treat malaria, comes from the bark of the Cinchona tree. Researchers estimate the remedy has been used for close to 400 years but was first isolated by French scientists in 1820. Quinine and cinchona bark are also toxic, and taken in high doses can lead to “cinchonism” which includes hearing and vision loss, breathing issues as well as heart and kidney issues.Prof Bell warned against the post’s claim that it was safe to consume Cinchona tree bark.“Given that cinchona powder could contain unknown amounts of quinine, the risks of taking this outweigh any possible benefits,” Prof Simon Bell said.Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and mild cases of lupus.  Its predecessor, chloroquine, (which isn’t approved for use in Australia) is prescribed solely as an antimalarial.Experts have expressed concerns about using hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, with some possible side effects and doubts about the medication’s effectiveness against COVID-19 among issues raised.The April 10 post states “many people recovered from the COVID19 virus after receiving chloroquine, the popular anti malaria / lupus drug”.However the studies that have been reported are based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and small numbers of patients. The French study was based on a sample of 42 patients with only 20 people treated with the drugs and six people dropping out during the trial.The Australian Department of Health told AAP FactCheck in an email that they do not recommended using cinchona powder to treat COVID-19. “Cinchona bark or powder may contain quinine type chemicals in unknown quantities and [be] mixed with a range of other chemicals,” the Department of Health spokesperson said.Despite hydroxychloroquine being explored as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in clinical trials around the world, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in March cast doubt on its effectiveness as a treatment for COVID-19 and warned that it can cause cardiac toxicity and irreversible blindness.“While there are some clinical trials that have started in Australia and elsewhere in relation to COVID-19, it is not recommended that people use these drugs for COVID-19 prevention or treatment except within an organised clinical trial,” the Department of Health spokesperson said. Hydroxychloroquine and its related drug chloroquine are synthetic substances derived by scientists.","http://archive.is/wip/WPn1Z,http://archive.is/Y3bQ0,http://archive.is/Y3bQ0,http://archive.is/Tw9Jb,http://archive.is/Y3bQ0,http://archive.is/Tw9Jb,http://archive.is/Y3bQ0,http://archive.today/kjmyO,http://archive.today/kjmyO,http://archive.is/tgBH1,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/,http://archive.today/n42FX,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-malaria.html,http://archive.is/6zfAV,https://www.fda.gov/media/136534/download,http://archive.is/p6BaA,http://archive.today/wrL8r,https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/simon-bell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3121651/,https://www.nap.edu/read/11017/chapter/7#130,http://archive.vn/aY5LR,https://www.healthline.com/health/hydroxychloroquine-oral-tablet#dosage,http://archive.is/QhUQm,http://archive.is/sBCC7,http://archive.is/Y3bQ0,http://archive.today/n42FX,https://www.health.gov.au/,https://www.tga.gov.au/,http://archive.vn/VOnPe",Instagram’s COVID-19 chloroquine merchants are barking up the wrong tree,,,,,,

Two other photos in the post are of a distant phone tower and a distant, lit-up horizon.The post has garnered more than 600 reactions and 800 comments, and has been shared more than 900 times.A Facebook post claims to show evidence of phone towers being burned down in New Zealand. The AnalysisAs of April 15, New Zealand remains at Alert Level 4 alert due to COVID-19, with most of the population in lockdown except for essential travel and services.Amidst the global outbreak of the potentially deadly viral infection, conspiracy theorists have pushed claims of a link between New Zealand’s lockdown and the rollout of 5G technology around the country while elsewhere some have sought to claim 5G is causing the COVID-19 viral outbreak.New Zealand’s Ministry of Health and the nation’s Chief Science Advisor have published information about 5G and health, with the Chief Science Advisor stating that according to current research findings it is extremely unlikely that there will be adverse health affects.On Wednesday, April 8, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters any claimed link between 5G and COVID-19 is “just not true”.Despite this, anti-5G sentiment is leading to threats of vandalism of the telecommunications network and 5G towers.New Zealand’s Telecommunications Forum (TCF) said in a statement on April 9 that threats to 5G towers have been made and some towers have been damaged, including attempts of arson. A 4G tower was also confirmed to have been damaged. A spokesperson for New Zealand telco Spark told the New Zealand Herald that since the end of March there has been “vandalism, including arson attempts at a few of our cell towers”.The burning of a cellphone tower in the Auckland suburb of Mangere on April 5 is currently under investigation. A video posted on Facebook, which police believe is linked to the fire, features a tower being doused in flammable liquid and set alight. The words “f**k you 5G, f**k you Government, f**k you New World Order” are spoken by a person in the video.A 4G tower under construction on private land in Waiharara was irreparably damaged by arson late March, according to a media report. It was built by the Rural Connectivity Group to bring 4G connectivity to rural “blackspot” areas with poor or no internet connection, and was yet to be activated.AAP Factcheck traced the image of the burning tower in the original Facebook post and found it is a still from a video posted to Youtube by a Hungarian user on March 10, 2019 and since viewed more than 18,000 times.The image in question can be seen 33 seconds into the 59 second video, which shows a series of burning towers and a collapsing radio mast. A Google Translate translation of the Hungarian caption on the video reads: “People took their destiny into their own hands”.At the 37 second mark what appears to be a US flag – a flag with red and white horizontal stripes and a dark square in the upper corner – is visible alongside the burning phone tower. The flag is also partially visible in the still image in the Facebook post.The video is watermarked @chalkbodyoutline, which is a Youtube account based in the United States. A mobile phone mast surrounded by clouds.","http://archive.is/OpN22,http://archive.today/iXCVU,https://www.aap.com.au/crossed-wires-over-nz-coronavirus-lockdown-and-5g-rollout-link/,https://www.aap.com.au/phone-tower-put-up-overnight-in-covid-19-conspiracy-claim-has-been-there-at-least-seven-months/,https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/environmental-health/radiation-environment/cellsites-and-5g,https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/2020/02/12/explained-what-is-5g-how-will-it-affect-new-zealand-in-2020/,http://archive.today/HwwRt,https://www.tcf.org.nz/consumers/news/2020-04-09-telco-industry-condemns-wilful-damage-to-mobile-network/ ,http://archive.vn/dyi8C,http://archive.is/qcI4z,http://archive.is/Okp79,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfb8ZD9IEY,http://archive.is/9CRd0,https://www.google.com/search?q=translate&rlz=1C1GCEV_enAU861AU862&oq=translate+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i64l3.3084j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.youtube.com/user/chalkbodyoutline/about","NZ “burning tower” image seems to be from US, via Hungary",,,,,,

Every time the world gets an upgrade on its electromagnetic field it messes people breathing up clearly”.The April 5 Facebook post has been viewed 31,000 times, shared over 200 times and attracted over 80 comments. A Facebook user seeks to correlate the roll out of mobile technology and disease outbreaks. The AnalysisThe April 5 Facebook post seeks to correlate various disease outbreaks with the rollout of new telecommunications technologies, starting with:  “5G launched, COVID-19 2019”.According to American telecommunications and technology company QualComm, 5G is currently commercially available in only 33 countries around the world including Australia. COVID-19 infections, however, have been recorded in 184  countries and regions, including two cruise ships, as of April 9, 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine COVID-19 Map.The Facebook post then goes on to state: “4G launched, H1N1 2009”.Australia recorded 37,357 confirmed cases of the H1N1, also known as Swine Flu, and reported 191 deaths as a result of the virus in 2009, according to the federal Department of Health. However, the country’s first commercial rollout of 4G technology didn’t occur until two years later in 2011.The post then claims both 3G and 1G occurred at the same time as influenza outbreaks in 1998 and 1979 respectively.According to the World Health Organization, there are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B circulate yearly, with annual epidemics estimated to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year. The 3G network was switched on in Australia in 2003 not 1998 and the 1G network was rolled out in 1987 not 1979, as claimed by the April 5 Facebook post.The post also says: “2G Launched, Cholera 1991”.According to the Victorian Department of Health, Australia records between two and six cases of Cholera each year. People are typically infected in places where the disease is endemic like parts of Africa, South East Asia and South America. The 2G network was rolled out in Australia on April 27, 1993 — not 1991.Also note that, while the post claims changes in technology “messes people up breathing clearly”, Cholera is a bacterial infection, spread by contaminated water or food, that causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration.The post then says: “The introduction of radio waves caused the Spanish flu of 1918”.The Spanish Flu hit Australia’s shores in early January 1919, infected about 40 per cent of the population and killed 15,000 people by the time it had dissipated at the end of 1919. Australia’s inaugural commercial radio broadcast occurred in 1923, when audiences across Sydney tuned in to hear the St Andrew Choir perform ‘The Swan’ by Saint Saens, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.The post finally claims: “Every time the world gets an upgrade on its electromagnetic field it messes people breathing up clearly”.Experts from around the world have come out to debunk the theory, including Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy. “There is no evidence telecommunication technologies, such as 5G, cause adverse health impacts,” he said in a January 24 statement.The body responsible for protecting Australians from radiation exposure, The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), said in a March 20, 2019 statement the radiation emitted by 5G technology is well below levels that could harm humans.“It is the assessment of ARPANSA and international organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation (ICNIRP) that there is no established scientific evidence to support any adverse health effects from very low RF EME exposures to populations or individuals,” the statement reads.An April 2020 statement from ARPANSA says that studies of the effects of low-level radio wave exposure, such as from 5G telecommunications “have not provided evidence of changes in immune function”.“There is no established evidence that low level radio wave exposure from 5G and other wireless telecommunications can affect the immune system or cause any other long term or short term health effects,” the statement says.A post seeking to link disease outbreaks with new communications technologies gets its facts wrong.","http://archive.is/wip/0iQnA,http://archive.is/wip/QmCwY,http://archive.is/wip/QmCwY,http://archive.is/wip/QmCwY,http://archive.is/HX825,http://archive.is/eLCJF,http://archive.is/yHfPe,https://www.health.gov.au/,https://www.smh.com.au/business/new-telstra-mobile-network-25x-faster-20110927-1kugm.html,https://www.who.int/,http://archive.is/9dO8K,http://archive.is/0DkU2,http://archive.is/C5kw4,http://archive.is/wip/njAUV,http://archive.is/i6v3a,http://archive.is/x0vhe,http://archive.is/A8ujj,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/cholera,http://archive.is/DdOkH,http://archive.is/Egtlo,http://archive.is/ooLX4,https://www.abc.net.au/,http://archive.is/Ly6qf/image,http://archive.is/VfMAQ,http://archive.is/Taszs,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/,http://archive.is/JUZgQ,http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs304/en/,https://www.icnirp.org/en/applications/base-stations/index.html,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-and-other-telecommunications-do-not-affect-immune-system",Dates don’t line up when comparing disease epidemics and new mobile technology rollouts,,,,,,
219,,,,False,,2020-04-09,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-pandemic-not-a-case-of-history-repeating-itself/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementWith the death toll from COVID-19 rising and fears of the havoc it may wreak on the global economy, a social media post suggests the pandemic is a case of history repeating itself.A Facebook post claims COVID-19 is the latest in a once-every-100-years  pattern of pandemics. A graphic comprises four consecutive images of deadly epidemics, each purportedly a century apart. The images indicate the pandemics and years in which they occurred: 1720 – Plague; 1820 – Cholera; 1920 – Spanish Flu; 2020 – Coronavirus. A note at the bottom of the images states: “It seems that history repeats itself every 100 years”.The post has been viewed more than 2.5 million times and shared more than 26,000 times. A Facebook post claims the COVID-19 crisis is the latest in a 100-year pattern of pandemics. The AnalysisThe earliest entry in the Facebook post is 1720, which could refer to the Great Plague of Marseille. The plague broke out in the southern French port city in 1720, after arriving via a trading ship.Unknown to those on board the ship, it carried a bacteria that causes plague, according to University of Texas at San Antonio assistant professor Cindy Ermus, who is completing a book on the Marseille plague.“The Great Plague of Provence, or Great Plague of Marseille, brought southern France to its knees, and led much of the rest of the world to impose strict measures to prevent its spread,” Ermus says in an article in The Washington Post.The epidemic claimed as many as 126,000 lives in the region of Provence, Ermus says. A website for the city of Marseille estimates the toll was 100,000 based on information from the Historical Federation of Provence and National Institute for Demographic Studies.Regarding the 1820 entry, there were six worldwide cholera pandemics between 1817 and 1923, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet.The first known cholera pandemic, from 1817-1823, originated in the Ganges River delta in India, according to a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) News feature exploring cholera’s deadly pandemics. The disease broke out near Calcutta and spread through the rest of the country before it spread to Southeast Asia, central Asia, the Middle East, eastern Africa, and the Mediterranean coast. The death toll from the outbreak is not known, but in 1820, 100,000 people died on the Indonesian island of Java alone.Regarding the post’s 1920 entry, the Spanish flu was  between 1918-19, according to The Lancet, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The influenza pandemic was the most severe in recent history, the CDC said. It was estimated about 500 million people or one third of the world’s population became infected with the virus. The number of deaths has been estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide.The last entry in the post’s graphic, 2020, refers to the current coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it was first informed on December 31, 2019 of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.The impact of what has become known as COVID-19 (previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus) has unfolded throughout 2020. As of April 9, WHO reported more than 1.3 million people worldwide had been infected with COVID-19 with a death toll of 79,385.The post concludes with the statement: ”It seems that history repeats itself every 100 years’. In the 20th century alone there were three influenza pandemics, according to WHO – two of which were not included in the post.In 1957-1958 there was the “Asian Flu” and in 1968, the “Hong Kong Flu”. They were estimated to have caused between one to four million deaths each, according to WHO. The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century H1NI is also not mentioned. It is estimated that the 2009 A(H1NI) “swine flu” pandemic caused between 105 000 and 395 000 deaths. The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century “swine flu” resulted in up to 395 000 deaths.","https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/06/an-early-view-of-the-economic-impact-of-the-pandemic-in-5-charts/,http://archive.is/DPVPi,https://marseillecityofculture.eu/great-plague-marseille/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567134812003681?via%3Dihub,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567134812003681?via%3Dihub,http://history.utsa.edu/faculty/ermus-cindy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/13/danger-prioritizing-politics-economics-during-coronavirus-outbreak/,https://marseillecityofculture.eu/great-plague-marseille/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60436-X/fulltext,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cholera-s-seven-pandemics-1.758504,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31360-6/fulltext,https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/CSR_ISR_2000_1/en/,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,http://archive.is/7pMwE,http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/pandemic-influenza/past-pandemics,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html,https://www.who.int/influenza/spotlight",COVID-19 pandemic not a case of history repeating itself,,,,,,

Visible in the background is a red building branded with the logo “Megabox”.The location of the MegaBox shopping centre is Enterprise Square Five 38 Wang Chiu Road, Kowloon Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The only MegaBox shopping centre on record is in Hong Kong, with no record of a MegaBox shopping centre in Wuhan, China.AAP FactCheck used Google Street View to determine where the video was taken from and found the location to be at, or close to, 11 Sheng Yuet Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong.The 2019 Hong Kong protests erupted in response to a proposed extradition law that could have seen the transfer of fugitives from the semi autonomous region to mainland China.Hong Kong’s ‘smart’ lamp posts have been controversial since their rollout in June 2019. The lamp posts are being used to support the 5G network on the island among other things. Protesters, however, are pulling them down because they believe the posts house cameras that could feed facial recognition software, not over fears related to the roll out of a 5G network.The incident filmed did not occur in 2020 but in fact happened in August, 2019, as evidenced by video and photography from two more sources.A photo from Getty Images photographer Anthony Kwan shows the same lamp post being pulled down in close proximity to a building branded with an “Exchange Tower” logo. The Exchange Tower building is visible to the left of 11 Sheng Yuet rd, Kowloon, in Google Street View.The caption of Kwan’s photo reads: “Protesters attempt to pull down a smart lamp post during an anti-government rally in Kowloon Bay district on August 24, 2019 in Hong Kong, China”.A video published by The Guardian on August 26 uses some of the exact same footage showing protesters spraying the  lamp post with an unidentified substance. The Guardian video is titled “Hong Kong: anti-surveillance protesters tear down ‘smart’ lamp post” and was uploaded on August 26, 2019.On December 31 2019 the World Health Organization was informed that pneumonia of an unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China. The culprit would later be identified as the new coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, placing the beginning of the outbreak of the potentially deadly disease months after Hong Kong protesters felled ‘smart’ lamp posts around the semi autonomous region. A protester tosses a tear gas pellet during a demonstration in Hong Kong in October, 2019.","https://connect.aap.com.au/http/archive.is/YjEas,https://www.facebook.com/mark.toxteth/videos/vb.559303513/10159022780978514/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/mark.toxteth/videos/vb.559303513/10159022780978514/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/mark.toxteth/videos/vb.559303513/10159022780978514/?type=2&theater,http://www.megabox.com.hk/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Enterprise%20Square%20Five%2038%20Wang%20Chiu%20Road%2C%20Kowloon%20Bay%2C%20Kowloon%2C%20Hong%20Kong&oq=Enterprise+Square+Five+38+Wang+Chiu+Road%2C+Kowloon+Bay%2C+Kowloon%2C+Hong+Kong&aqs=chrome..69i57.146j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sxsrf=ALeKk033xwTpV19p6QiI6SNEsYTAIFlbng:1586230549752&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=22319893,114208281,18&tbm=lcl&rldimm=10221087709973854451&lqi=CklFbnRlcnByaXNlIFNxdWFyZSBGaXZlIDM4IFdhbmcgQ2hpdSBSb2FkLCBLb3dsb29uIEJheSwgS293bG9vbiwgSG9uZyBLb25nGXJHerdK4HL3SOWx6TdaeAoWZW50ZXJwcmlzZSBzcXVhcmUgZml2ZRAAEAEQAhgAGAEYAxgEGAUYBhgHGAgYCSJGZW50ZXJwcmlzZSBzcXVhcmUgZml2ZSAzOCB3YW5nIGNoaXUgcm9hZCBrb3dsb29uIGJheSBrb3dsb29uIGhvbmcga29uZw&ved=2ahUKEwjXqsyjsdXoAhXUzTgGHZoNAdwQvS4wAHoECAsQJg&rldoc=1&tbs=lrf:!1m4!1u3!2m2!3m1!1e1!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e16!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2&rlst=f#rlfi=hd:;si:10221087709973854451,l,CklFbnRlcnByaXNlIFNxdWFyZSBGaXZlIDM4IFdhbmcgQ2hpdSBSb2FkLCBLb3dsb29uIEJheSwgS293bG9vbiwgSG9uZyBLb25nGXJHerdK4HL3SOWx6TdaeAoWZW50ZXJwcmlzZSBzcXVhcmUgZml2ZRAAEAEQAhgAGAEYAxgEGAUYBhgHGAgYCSJGZW50ZXJwcmlzZSBzcXVhcmUgZml2ZSAzOCB3YW5nIGNoaXUgcm9hZCBrb3dsb29uIGJheSBrb3dsb29uIGhvbmcga29uZw;mv:[[22.3209156,114.20876],[22.3192745,114.20697589999999]];tbs:lrf:!1m4!1u3!2m2!3m1!1e1!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e16!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2,https://ggstreetview.com/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Exchange+Tower,+33+Wang+Chiu+Rd,+Kowloon+Bay,+Hong+Kong/@22.3216733,114.2085804,3a,75y,168.18h,96.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1styxxzwJGnGpzo0f6LoKg0w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x340401347590b7f7:0x966695dd264c048c!8m2!3d22.3210973!4d114.2094216,http://archive.is/Ooa8s,http://archive.is/TBQQu,http://archive.is/sf7t3,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/protesters-attempt-to-pull-down-a-smart-lamppost-during-an-news-photo/1163603517?adppopup=true,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/photos/anthony-kwan,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.google.com/maps/place/Exchange+Tower,+33+Wang+Chiu+Rd,+Kowloon+Bay,+Hong+Kong/@22.3216837,114.2087125,3a,45.1y,113.83h,93.95t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sDDVGXnq3nPoFUYIEVUU0Qg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!9m2!1b1!2i45!4m5!3m4!1s0x340401347590b7f7:0x966695dd264c048c!8m2!3d22.3210973!4d114.2094216,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Ji7wonUhE&feature=emb_logo,https://www.who.int/,http://archive.is/tzqz6",People cutting down lamp post were not in Wuhan and were not protesting about 5G technology,,,,,,

The user then urges people to tag friends and share it via messaging and news sites.The Facebook post has been viewed over 100,000 times, been shared over 900 times and attracted over 800 comments. A Facebook user claims a 5G tower was erected “overnight” at a suburban shopping centre. The AnalysisOn March 11 the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a “pandemic”. Australia has implemented testing regimes, border controls and movement restrictions in the face of an deepening international crisis.Despite state, national and international health authorities and researchers having found that COVID-19 originated from an animal source and first infected humans in Wuhan, China, numerous conspiracy theories have been advanced, including the belief that 5G is connected to the spread of the viral disease.The April 4 post claims that a 5G tower “was put up OVERNIGHT” in Beaconsfield, which is a suburb south-east of Melbourne’s city centre.AAP FactCheck has traced the location of the photo back to the Beaconsfield Hub shopping centre. The centre houses shops including the UBE Bar & Eatery and the Glossed Nails and Beauty store pictured in the Facebook post.A Google Street View image taken of the shopping centre in August, 2019, shows the telecommunications tower in the photo was in the same location then, seven months before the Facebook post and four months before the novel coronavirus was first recorded in China. The image date is visible at the bottom left of the maps screen accessed through the link above.In addition to the false claim about a tower being put up during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also no evidence to support the claims of a link between the virus-borne disease and 5G towers.Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, made a statement in January saying that 5G technology is safe.“There is no evidence telecommunication technologies, such as 5G, cause adverse health impacts,” Professor Murphy said.“This position is supported by health authorities in Australia – such as the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) – and around the world, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).”Conspiracy theories linking COVID-19 and 5G have also spread in the UK, where politicians and government officials have addressed the claims, including cabinet secretary Michael Gove, who described them as “dangerous nonsense”.UK based charity Science Media Centre asked experts about the link between 5G and COVID-19. Those experts stated that there is no sensible link between 5G frequencies and any biological virus or bacteria. “The idea that COVID19 is caused by 5G mobile phone signals is complete rubbish. This is a disease which numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal,” Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, told the Centre. A phone tower damaged by fire in the UK.","http://archive.is/YjEas,http://archive.is/LujBT,https://www.who.int/,http://archive.is/9ixZS,http://archive.is/OU1Ik,http://archive.is/wip/ZMQHf,http://archive.is/wAknP,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#1-2,https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions_0.pdf,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,http://archive.today/uLOAB,https://www.parkleadevelopments.com.au/portfolio_page/beaconsfield-hub/,https://www.google.com/search?q=UBE+bar+and+eatery&oq=ub&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j0l2j69i60l3.2639j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.google.com/search?q=glossed+nails+and+beauty+beaconsfield&oq=glossed+nails+and+beauty+beaconsfield&aqs=chrome.0.0l5.10423j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x6ad61bd75263d0cb%3A0xcf2d17caf6389251!3m1!7e115!4s%2Fmaps%2Fplace%2FUBE%2Bbar%2Band%2Beatery%2F%40-38.0475727%2C145.3696352%2C3a%2C75y%2C190.56h%2C90t%2Fdata%3D*213m4*211e1*213m2*211sX-dEOfN1Q2UG9akRjeRwpw*212e0*214m2*213m1*211s0x6ad61bd75263d0cb%3A0xcf2d17caf6389251%3Fsa%3DX!5sUBE%20bar%20and%20eatery%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCAQ&imagekey=!1e2!2sX-dEOfN1Q2UG9akRjeRwpw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwim7u7n3tLoAhXKxTgGHQHqBAAQpx8wCnoECB0QCw,https://www.health.gov.au/news/safety-of-5g-technology,http://archive.is/YjEas,https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/,http://archive.is/TL4Lf,https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/s-r-clarke.aspx",Phone tower “put up overnight” in COVID-19 conspiracy claim has been there at least seven months,,,,,,

The post, which features footage from the series “My Secret, Terrius”, reads: “China virus. They put it on tv 2 years Before it happened And look at China now as of March 28 2020”.The post features a video, seemingly shot on a mobile phone, with an unseen male speaker directing viewers to the 53 minute mark of episode 10 of My Secret, Terrius, which is subtitled in English. In the show, an on-screen doctor can be seen telling an individual that tests have found a mutant coronavirus that is more dangerous than the previously known strains of the virus, MERS and SARS. The doctor explains the coronavirus has a mortality rate of 90 per cent has been manipulated to attack the lungs within five minutes of being exposed.The post has been viewed more than 17,000 times and shared more than 130 times. A Facebook post claims a South Korean drama series predicted the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2018. The AnalysisThe first cases of COVID-19 emerged in December 2019, when a mysterious illness reported in Wuhan, China. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses which also the SARS and MERS respiratory infections.In the My Secret, Terrius clip, the doctor correctly says the coronavirus is related to same family as MERS and SARS but incorrectly states it is related to “the common flu”. While the common cold is caused by a coronavirus, influenza is a different virus. The doctor character says the mutant virus has been tweaked to result in a death rate of almost 90 per cent. Regarding the COVID-19 mortality rate, the World Health Organization reported on March 17: “Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between three to four per cent.”Regarding the show’s claim that the mutant virus can attack lungs within five minutes of exposure, the WHO estimates the incubation period for COVID-19 ranges from 1-14 days. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, according to WHO. As to the origin of COVID-19, research published in the journal Nature Medicine concluded the virus was the product of natural evolution. The paper “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” concludes COVID-19 was “not a purposefully manipulated virus”.“Since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) features … in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” the authors said.A statement in The Lancet written by public health officials concluded that animals were the likely source of the virus: “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.”","http://archive.vn/ihR75,https://www.aap.com.au/a-novel-published-in-1981-did-not-predict-the-2019-coronavirus/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/,http://archive.vn/Dpk7G,https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81085163,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/colds-and-flu-types,https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/influenza/en/,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-similarities-and-differences-covid-19-and-influenza,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9#ref-CR5,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext#bib13",South Korean TV series high on drama but not foresight of COVID-19 crisis,,,,,,
223,,,,False –,,2020-04-06,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/false-claims-about-viruses-and-covid-19-in-facebook-video/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAs global cases of COVID-19 exceed one million, a video circulating on Facebook attempts to cast doubt on the existence of the potentially deadly virus.The March 31 video posted to Facebook, uploaded after the original was taken down, makes a number of false and unsubstantiated claims, including that humans can’t catch viruses, that viruses are solvents and that viruses aren’t transmissible between species or between humans.The caption of the re-uploaded video reads: “What does this guy have to gain by telling us this, what does the government have to gain by not telling us this!!! Wake!! Up!!”The March 31 video has been viewed over 175,000 times, received over 1,800 interactions and over 850 comments. A widely shared Facebook video makes a number of false claims about viruses and COVID-19. The AnalysisCOVID-19 infection cases have now passed 5,700 in Australia, with the death toll at 36. The video, created by an Australian anti-vaccination campaigner and one-time political candidate, Tom Barnett, claims “you cannot catch a virus,” that viruses “do not attack cell tissue” and that “viruses are not living”.Viruses are parasitic biological entities that have genetic material contained inside a protein coat or shell.  They invade cells of other organisms and hijack them to reproduce themselves. The first virus know to affect humans, Yellow Fever, was discovered in 1901.University of Sydney Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Hannah Sassi told AAP FactCheck that humans can catch viruses and do so in different ways depending on the type of virus. “We can inhale them, we can ingest them, or get them through skin contact and punctures,” she said.Viruses attack the cells within the tissue, not the tissue itself, said Dr Sassi. In biology the term tissue refers to a group of cells with a similar structure that function together as a unit.There is some scientific debate over whether viruses should be classified as “alive” because they rely on other organisms to survive and reproduce. According to University of California Professor of Molecular Biology Luis P. Villarreal, scientists have grappled with how to define viruses for 100 years: “First seen as poisons, then as life forms, then biological chemicals, viruses today are thought of as being in a gray area between living and nonliving,” he wrote.In the video, the speaker states: “viruses are nothing more than a solvent” that are “created within the cells of the body”.Dr Sassi told AAP FactCheck that solvents are chemical solutions that have nothing to do with viruses. “Viruses are a genome, which means it has DNA and RNA and they reproduce. Chemicals don’t reproduce,” she said.The video also claims that viruses detoxify the cells within the body and “what needs cleaning out of the cells are environmental toxins, such as heavy metals, plastics, any type of industrial pollutants”.Dr Sassi said viruses are unrelated to toxins, heavy metals, plastics, or any type of industrial pollutants. “The virus is just trying to reproduce to survive,” she said.The video then says “viruses are specific to certain cells in the body. A virus that attacks the lungs will not affect the kidney”.Most viruses are specific to certain types of cells, but they can also travel to different parts of the body, Dr Sassi said. “One virus that is really good at replicating once inside the body is Ebola Virus. It will replicate until it’s in the bloodstream, then once it’s in the bloodstream it can be carried throughout the body,” she said.Ebola targets the liver and the immune system, preventing the body from clearing toxins from the bloodstream and allowing it to travel.The speaker in the video states: “because a virus is not transmissible within your own body, it should make sense that a virus is not transmissible between people”. He then claims that “this is why you can’t get an avian flu or swine flu, a bat flu and monkey flu or any other flu”.Humans can transmit viruses. When a person becomes infected with a virus, their body can become “a reservoir of virus particles, which can be released in bodily fluids – such as by coughing or sneezing,” writes Bond University Associate Professor Lotti Tajouri. Viruses are transmitted when particles either end up on a new potential host or an inanimate object, he says.Humans can contract swine flu, avian flu and other types of viruses from animals, according to the federal Department of Health. These viruses are types of zoonotic diseases, which can be spread when humans come into direct contact or indirect contact with infected animals, through insect bites and contaminated food or water, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.Australian National University Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases David Tscharke told AAP FactCheck many viruses require more than one species. “Think about dengue fever: the virus grows in mosquitoes and it also grows in the affected people,” he said.Barnett then recommends people “don’t get a flu shot”.A federal Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that everyone six months or older should be vaccinated against influenza during April to avoid a “double-up of flu and coronavirus”.Barnett also asks: “Who is actually counting these deaths, and who’s actually verifying that the deaths aren’t from any standard flu?”The spokesperson for the federal Department of Health said the department is notified by state and territory health departments.“The current case definition for the notification of a COVID-19 case, including associated deaths, requires laboratory confirmation for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19),” the spokesperson said. A healthcare worker in protective equipment at a hospital in Brooklyn, New York.","http://archive.is/eSeo2,http://archive.is/eSeo2,http://archive.today/6Vz3e,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/,http://archive.is/bQq2I,http://archive.is/b8964,http://archive.is/BUYj3,http://archive.is/CXDkK,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848616300103,http://archive.today/bQq2I,http://archive.is/wip/cIQMG,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8131916_Are_Viruses_Alive,http://archive.is/7gLGo,http://archive.is/bQq2I,https://bond.edu.au/profile/lotti-tajouri,http://archive.is/wip/K8F9z,http://archive.is/wip/TtYe7,https://www.health.gov.au/,https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html,https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/professor-david-tscharke,https://www.health.gov.au/",False claims about viruses and COVID-19 in Facebook video,,,,,,

Overlaid on the video is “Te Puke”, the name of a Bay of Plenty town, and the words “what the actual f*k”. The video has been viewed more than 100 times and received 722 shares. A Facebook post claims a video shows military tanks on a train in New Zealand. The AnalysisThe COVID-19 crisis gripping the world has prompted many countries to invoke emergency powers, giving them the ability to impose policies that would normally require changes to existing legislation. For example, the United States declared a national emergency on March 13   to deal with the panademic, while similar measures have been announced in countries such as Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand. The adoption of emergency powers in countries such as the US has led to rumours on social media that a declaration of martial law – in which the military would take control of most government functions – will be the next step. US officials have addressed these claims directly and said they are incorrect.The Facebook video purporting to show military train movements in Te Puke was filmed from a car at a level crossing. A search of KiwiRail’s database of level crossings revealed there is only one level crossing in Te Puke itself, plus four in the surrounding area. Examination of those level crossings via Google Maps shows none resemble the crossing featured in the video. A web search revealed that the same clip – minus the Te Puke caption – was uploaded to YouTube on March 20, five days earlier under the title ‘Train full of Military vehicles in #Florida (2014)’.Still images from the video also surfaced on Twitterand on Facebook on March 21, with claims they were taken in Florida. FactCheck has been unable to identify the original source of the video.Regardless of the location or date of the footage, the New Zealand Defence Force does not actually own any tanks, with its Scorpion fleet being withdrawn from service in 1998. The tanks featured in the video appear to be US-built Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which are used primarily by the US Army and are not used by New Zealand’s Defence Force. Finally, the car from which the video was taken is a left-hand drive vehicle, as indicated by the instrument enclosure visible in the bottom of the frame. Vehicles in New Zealand are right-hand drive, again suggesting that the footage was shot in the US and not in New Zealand.  US Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles in action in Iraq in 2003.","http://archive.today/5u1R9,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2020/March/COVID-19_Biosecurity_Emergency_Declaration,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020,https://covid19.govt.nz/government-actions/state-of-national-emergency/,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/20/us/ap-not-real-news.html,https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Rumor-Control/,http://data-kiwirail.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5dc1526435a043e5be1c841727f465f7_0/geoservice?geometry=176.266%2C-37.794%2C176.383%2C-37.770&page=2,https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.7786995,176.3142689,3a,60y,28.21h,61.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1VVsS8TETNVHA89kKveIcQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en&authuser=0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2glLXithqcM&app=desktop,http://archive.today/DQoCz,http://archive.today/Hx4kg,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/feature/rebuilding-capability-new-zealand-defence-force-66,https://www.baesystems.com/en/product/bradley-fighting-vehicle,https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/roadcode-questions/car/core/what-side-drive-nz/",NZ “tanks on train” footage a rerun of US social media claims,,,,,,

I Fkn knew it! We are locked until all the towers are done”. The featured comment, circled in red, reads, “My hubby’s mate just called him on Thursday to say he’d just counted about 10 (towers) going up in Wellington. He saw one of the workers that he knew so pulled over to ask him. He said, bro we signed a contract we are not allowed to discuss…but we’ve got four weeks to get these up!”The screenshot is accompanied by the Facebook user’s comment, “End The Lockdown, Bring them down!”The March 30 post has attracted more than 51,000 views, 400 shares and 80 comments.  A post claims there is a link between NZ’s COVID-19 lockdown and the installation of 5G towers. The AnalysisThe first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in New Zealand was reported on February 28, 2020. As of April 2 there have been 723 confirmed cases in NZ and one person has died.On March 23, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the New Zealand government would lift its COVID-19 alert level setting from two to four following a spike in the number of cases. A nationwide lockdown for a four-week period came into force from 11:59pm, March 25, with restrictions placed on travel and movement. A state of emergency was also declared.5G is the next generation of mobile communication technology, however some groups have raised questions regarding health risks posed by the network. The World Health Organization and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), say there is no established evidence that exposure to 5G and other wireless communications cause adverse health effects.In a media release on December 16, 2019, New Zealand’s Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Kris Faafoi said: “5G offers significantly improved data speed and capacity for conventional mobile and fixed wireless broadband networks, and will enable the next wave of productivity and innovation across multiple sectors.” On January 14, 2020 the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor said in a media release that NZ’s 5G network had launched in some locations, initially in Alexandra followed by “parts of Westport, Twizel, Tekapo, Hokitika and Clyde”. The release also says: “Vodafone launched 5G in parts of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown in December 2019.”A Newshub report on August 29, 2019 stated that “five new 5G mobile sites are now live in Auckland” ahead of the network’s launch in December 2019. It also reported that a further “95 sites also scheduled to be operational by (that) time”. A spokesperson for NZ’s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which is responsible for the 5G contracts, told AAP FactCheck in an email that any claim of a link between the COVID-19 lockdown and the 5G rollout is “completely untrue.” A claimed link between NZ’s COVID-19 lockdown and 5G tower rollout is untrue, the government says. “COVID-19 is a global problem and many countries are imposing national or regional lockdowns. The rollout of 5G is likely to be delayed not accelerated by the COVID-19 restrictions and economic impacts. New Zealand is not locked down for the purpose of installing 5G towers,” the spokesperson said.The post’s claim that “we’ve got four weeks to get these up!” is also untrue, the MBIE said. “Vodafone’s 5G rollout in Wellington (and in Auckland, Christchurch and Queenstown) has been well publicised and is required to be completed in accordance with planning and resource management consents,” the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.“There is nothing in the COVID-19 emergency powers to override that and, therefore, no deadline which needs to be pushed to complete work before or by the end of the COVID-19 level four alert lockdown.”","http://archive.is/7GrhZ,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,http://archive.is/b0t8G,http://archive.is/jzJgW,http://archive.vn/3kHvG,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/minister/rt-hon-jacinda-ardern,https://covid19.govt.nz/government-actions/current-covid-19-alert-level/,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/prime-minister%E2%80%99s-statement-state-national-emergency-and-epidemic-notice,https://www.civildefence.govt.nz/resources/previous-emergencies/declared-states-of-emergency/,https://www.rsm.govt.nz/projects-and-auctions/current-projects/preparing-for-5g-in-new-zealand/,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/5g-mobile-networks-and-health,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-new-generation-mobile-phone-network-and-health,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/news/5g-and-other-telecommunications-do-not-affect-immune-system,https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-enables-early-access-5g-spectrum,https://cpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.auckland.ac.nz/dist/f/688/files/2020/02/5G_in_Aotearoa_New_Zealand_14_01_2020.pdf,http://archive.is/5oMIK",There is no link between NZ’s coronavirus lockdown and 5G rollout,,,,,,

BODY BAGS were delivered to the ice arena in theberton (sic) #adelaide“.There is an ice rink in Thebarton, Adelaide called IceArenA.The post goes on to state: “It’s being turned into a make shift (sic) morgue… Please stay home n (sic) be safe”.The Facebook post has been viewed over 16,500 times, been shared over 80 times and received over 100 comments. A Facebook user claims a makeshift morgue is being set up in an Adelaide ice rink. The AnalysisThe escalating COVID-19 crisis is putting huge pressure on medical systems around the world and on morgues. Spain, for example, has faced an enormous challenge in caring for those infected by COVID-19 and accommodating the bodies of those killed by the virus. The Spanish government has been forced to turn an ice rink into a temporary morgue.In Australia, according to a March 28 Canberra Times report, the ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said that Canberra’s only ice rink could be used as a makeshift morgue, but only in the worst case scenario.“We don’t want to see that happen, but we are planning for the worst, and we need to do that in case it comes to that,” she reportedly said.Similar rumours surrounding Adelaide’s only ice rink, the Thebarton IceArenA, previously called Mt Thebarton, have been circulating on Facebook and Reddit since March 27, with posts claiming the rink has received 500 or more body bags in preparation to be turned into a makeshift morgue.But Thebarton Ice ArenA manager Tenille Henry-Comley told AAP FactCheck the claims made in the Facebook post and Reddit thread are false and that the ice rink’s chillers have been off since March 29.“If we had any morgue being set up here, we’d be pretty silly because we have no way to keep anything cold,” Ms Henry-Comley said.The myth that the Ice ArenA will be turned into a morgue has been doing the rounds for years, according to Ms Henry-Comley, who said people regularly ask her if the rumours are true.“As far as we know, SA health has never had us in the state emergency plan. Clearly because if something was to happen like that there are much bigger sources of cold storage in the state,” she said.A SA Health spokesperson confirmed that the IceArenA is not being turned into a makeshift morgue and that ice rink is not a part of the SA Health emergency management plan.“I think it’s one of those urban legends that always crop up, but there are no plans for this,” the spokesperson said. A post on Facebook claims an ice rink in Adelaide will be repurposed as a morgue.","http://archive.is/qtZ0h,https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/adelaide?__cft__[0]=AZWUAR7cAwhbEifjj5Z8swe6x8z5AfllqAzGKbCsmcBAh6TgcVVulysmeLz8AvaS4Kr1Q6IHtIZX0512SCl4TmLJhAHerP0Bd5bD7b_gjaHwD1OVUQsN991b-RYMgxBjaUo&__tn__=*NK-R,https://icearena.com.au/,http://archive.is/zqKex,http://archive.is/nEJ2y,http://archive.is/5j2H3/image,http://www.swimskate.com.au/ice-skating/skating-pricing-times/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us_1K_Ofsgw,http://archive.is/qtZ0h,http://archive.is/DiFcX,https://icearena.com.au/",Myth of Adelaide ice rink becoming a morgue resurrected amid COVID-19 crisis,,,,,,

If you do not have one, or your plan is not up-to date, please consult your doctor as soon as possible,” the foundation’s statement states.Reuters debunked the same claim made by a UK Facebook user on March 21. The Reuters article pointed to a statement from Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board. “Covid-19 (Coronavirus) is a new virus and there is very limited information on the use of steroids in the treatment of this illness,” reads the statement.“This is not an appropriate treatment for most people with respiratory conditions. Rescue packs should only be used by those people who have previously been prescribed them to manage flare ups of COPD as part of their agreed management plan,” reads the statement.Both the Marton Medical Practice in Blackpool (UK) and Lower Clapton Group Practice in London also addressed the fake posts. “Please do not contact your GP practice for a rescue pack. You should continue to manage your condition in the usual way and if you feel you have symptoms of COVID-19, go to https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19 before doing anything else,” their websites state. A pharmacist holds a bottle of the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate.","http://archive.is/OfZrU,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/chronic-respiratory,https://www.who.int/,https://www.cdc.gov/,http://archive.is/uQjU0,http://archive.is/GEDiH,https://asthmawa.org.au/coronavirus-and-asthma/,https://asthmawa.org.au/,https://asthmawa.org.au/coronavirus-and-asthma/,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1065124330510352&id=100010383842621,https://lungfoundation.com.au/,https://archive.st/archive/2020/3/lungfoundation.com.au/vrm7/lungfoundation.com.au/patients-carers/lung-health/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/advice-for-people-living-with-a-lung-condition/%20.html,https://archive.st/archive/2020/3/lungfoundation.com.au/vrm7/lungfoundation.com.au/patients-carers/lung-health/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/advice-for-people-living-with-a-lung-condition/%20.html,https://www.facebook.com/tina.marshall.9400984/posts/901508756953442,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-rescue-packs-respiratory/false-claim-patients-with-respiratory-conditions-can-receive-rescue-packs-from-their-doctor-idUSKBN21D2UV,http://www.hscboard.hscni.net/about-us/,http://archive.is/xHS4r,http://archive.is/xHS4r,https://www.martonmedicalpractice.co.uk/,https://www.lowerclapton.nhs.uk/,https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19,http://archive.is/sbQWC,http://archive.is/F3a9Z",Lung disease “rescue packs” claim blows into Australia from the UK,,,,,,
228,,,,False,,2020-03-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/a-vaccine-for-covid-19-is-not-about-to-hit-shelves/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post claiming to show a photo of a new vaccine for COVID-19 is spreading false hope as the economic, social and health impacts of the coronavirus deepen in Australia.   The March 23 post features a photograph of a pharmaceutical product, with a box, sachets and dropper bottle featuring the label “COVID-19 IgM-IgG”. The packaging is branded with the logo “Sugentech”. The caption accompanying the image reads: “Carona (sic) virus vaccine ready. Able to cure patient within 3 hours after injection. Hats off to US Scientists. Right now Trump announced that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine next Sunday, and millions of doses are ready from it.”The post has accumulated over 161,000 views, been shared over 1,100 times and received more than 60 comments.  A post falsely claims that the product pictured is a vaccine for COVID-19. The AnalysisWith the confirmed cases of COVID-19 nearing 3000 in Australia as of March 27, the search for a vaccine that could halt the prolonged spread of the potentially deadly virus is becoming more desperate. A March 23 post purports to show the vaccine that could do just that, but the items pictured aren’t what the post claims them to be.AAP FactCheck has identified at least three other posts making the same claims (here, here and here).AAP FactCheck has traced the packaging labels “Sugentec” and “COVID-19 IgM-IgG” pictured in the post to a pharmaceutical company’s product website. The website, from Korean medical diagnostic tools creator Sugentec, explains that COVID-19 IgM-IgG product is a test for the human antibodies created when a person is infected with COVID-19. “Antibodies can be found in the blood of those who are tested after infection [with COVID-19]. The antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to COVID-19, whether symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic,” reads the website. The product pictured on the website bears the same markings and labels as the one in the March 23 post. AAP FactCheck has traced the image used in the March 23 post back to a highly shared Twitter post made by German journalist Florian Witulski in relation to a new test for COVID-19. The post made no mention of a vaccine. The post reads “Korea finished developing the 10 minute Covid-19 diagnostic kit and is now ramping up production. They plan to export 300.000 test-kits per week”. The earliest instance of the image  is in an article on a Korean website called Bio-Spectator,published March 20. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, according to Australia’s Department of Health, the World Health Organization and the Centre for Disease Control. Around 35 organisations and countries, including Australia’s CSIRO are racing to create a vaccine for COVID-19, with one company entering human trials as of March 23, The Guardian and Time Magazine report.  A health worker in protective clothing tests a man for COVID-19 in Liepaja, Latvia.","http://archive.is/Yuwhx,http://archive.is/6AgG4,http://archive.is/Yuwhx,http://archive.is/bjbud,http://archive.is/AWvTz,http://archive.is/clQuU,http://archive.is/gmfgX,http://archive.is/taUtD,http://archive.is/doZmI,http://archive.is/TQTTG,http://archive.is/kwTjJ,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/how-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19#vaccination,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html,https://www.csiro.au/en/News/News-releases/2020/Covid19-expert-commentary,http://archive.is/JZYsm,http://archive.is/mrX4o",Post claiming to show a US-developed COVID-19 vaccine fails the truth test,,,,,,
229,,,,AAP Factcheck,,2020-03-27,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/ibuprofen-and-covid-19-link-infects-social-media/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA social media post claims to be passing on information someone received from “a doctor in the family” about a purported link between the pain reliever ibuprofen and deaths from COVID-19.A UK-based Facebook user states in a post, “I have a doctor in the family who has been given information from Vienna’s laboratory studying COVID-19 and vast majority of people who died of it, had ibuprofen so if you have symptoms, take Paracetamol only!!! Looks like the virus thrives on ibuprofen so don’t do it and tell everyone you can!!!”The March 16 post has been shared more than 15,000 times and viewed more than 1.4 million times. A Facebook post claims that there is a link between the pain reliever ibuprofen and COVID-19 deaths. The AnalysisIbuprofen, also sold under brand names such as Nurofen and Advil, is one of the world’s most commonly used pain medications. It belongs to a class of medicines known as NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products.On March 14, French Health Minister Olivier Véran issued a warning on Twitter on March 14 that “Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, …) could be a factor in worsening the infection,” advice which “left many medical experts scratching their heads,” according to The New York Times.A letter published on March 11 in the medical journal The Lancet has generated much discussion after its authors argued that there is a possibility ACE  (Angiotensin-converting-enzyme) inhibitors – a class of medication often used to control blood pressure – could be linked to COVID-19 mortality rates. The letter explains that human coronaviruses bind to their target cells through an enzyme called ACE2, which can be increased by use of ACE inhibitors and by use of ibuprofen. However, the letter states several times that it is only a hypothesis. This  point is reinforced by The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in an article titled, “Ibuprofen and COVID-19: What GPs need to know”.The post mentions “Vienna’s laboratory studying COVID-19”. A WhatsApp audio message that has circulated widely on social media features a female voice, speaking German, claiming a friend who is a doctor at the university hospital in Vienna, warned her that most patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 had taken ibuprofen before they came to hospital, according to a report.The Medical University of Vienna was later linked to the claimed COVID-19 laboratory study and issued a statement that the information is “fake news that has no connection with the MedUni Vienna”.The World Health Organization tweeted on March 18 that people can continue to use ibuprofen and they were “not aware of reports of any negative effects.” The World Health Organization tweeted on March 18 that people can continue to use ibuprofen. British firm Reckitt Benckiser, the makers of Nurofen, said on its website that ibuprofen “is a well-established medicine that has been used safely as a self-care fever and pain reducer, including in viral illnesses, for more than 30 years”.The company concurs with WHO that “based on all available information, there is currently no proven scientific evidence linking over-the-counter use of ibuprofen to the aggravation of COVID-19”.The Food and Drug Administration in the US also released a statement saying that there is no evidence the two are connected: “At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms.” The FDA is investigating the issue further.Professor Parastou Donyai and Director of Pharmacy Practice at Britain’s University of Reading told the BBC that, “there are many studies that suggest ibuprofen use during a respiratory infection can result in worsening of the disease or other complications.”  However, she added, “I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25-year-old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications.”A spokesperson for the New Zealand Ministry of Health told AAP Factcheck in a statement: “The rumour that ibuprofen will aggravate COVID-19 symptoms is based on a theoretical concern, not actual clinical observation.”The ministry’s MedSafe data sheet on ibuprofen contains a lengthy list of warnings on proper usage. It also states that NSAIDs are not recommended for people with many medical conditions or on blood thinners.","http://archive.is/uSfrb,https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/ibuprofen/,https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/medicines/n/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatories-nsaids/,https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/composition-of-the-government,http://archive.today/BHOzD,https://www.ibtimes.sg/france-says-drugs-like-ibuprofen-could-aggravate-covid-19-experts-differ-41186,http://archive.is/1dvl2,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR386i_pSpniyqPYaSEikp2ttI_J_fRshtKpUJ83MvHOsVLMjzsjxA4RFFo,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/ace-inhibitors/art-20047480,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/8/5/144,https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/ibuprofen-and-covid-19-what-gps-need-to-know,https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-fact-check-what-do-we-know-about-ibuprofen-and-covid-19,https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/ueber-uns/news/detailseite/2020/news-im-maerz/angebliche-forschungsergebnisse-der-wiener-uniklinik-rund-um-das-covid-19-virus-und-ibuprofen-sind-fake-news/,https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240409217997189128,https://www.rb.com/media/news/2020/march/who-and-ema-updates-advice-confirming-no-current-scientific-evidence-against-using-ibuprofen-in-treating-symptoms-of-covid-19/,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-advises-patients-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids-covid-19,https://www.reading.ac.uk/pharmacy/about/staff/p-donyai.aspx,https://www.bbc.com/news/51929628,https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/i/IbuprofenArrowcaretab.pdf",Ibuprofen and COVID-19 ‘link’ infects social media,,,,,,

THATS RIGHT PEOPLE!! All the rumours u may have heard about Chinese people buying up all our stock from super markets well its not a rumour!! Its TRUE”.The post continues: “The hole [sic] joint was full of repacked boxes of BABY FORMULA, TOILET PAPER, PALLETS OF HAND SANITIZER, TISSUES, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS,” The post then says: “They had everything from cleaning products to food pasta, rice, tinned goods, pet food even medicine and boxes of paracetamol/panadol,”The post finally claims: “When i asked the asian guy told me they have been packing 2 shipping containers full everyday and sending it all back to China!! And the company responsible for shipping it all is a company called Freight Net”.The Facebook post has been viewed over 6.5 million times, shared at least 100,000 times and has been interacted with over 15,000 times since being posted on March 20. A Facebook post claims a Melbourne factory is sending food, toilet paper and other items to China.The AnalysisWith the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at more than 2,250 as of March 25, the coronavirus outbreak forced the introduction of strict new measures including overseas travel bans, requirements to remain at home except for essential outings and closures of non-essential businesses.Fears about the impacts of the virus have also triggered panic buying and hoarding that have left many supermarket shelves bare, with toilet paper and basic food and sanitary items particularly targeted.AAP FactCheck found three separate iterations of a widely shared March 20 Facebook post that claims a Melbourne based e-commerce business and freight company are sending essential goods to China. The posts were all uploaded after the March 20 post. (See them here, here and here)The posts claim freight company TT Express has been “packing 2 shipping containers full everyday” of essential items like  “food pasta, rice, tinned goods, pet food even medicine and boxes of paracetamol/panadol” and been “sending it all back to China”.Head accountant of TT Express Dinh Nguyen told AAP FactCheck in an interview that TT Express doesn’t send any goods to China. Rather the company ships consumer goods back to Vietnam for Vietnamese people living in Melbourne.Since the post went viral on Facebook TT Express has had to close down their Facebook and Google business pages after receiving torrents of abuse, Mr Nguyen said.“People keep calling and threatening, sending bad messages. We couldn’t handle it anymore,” he said.“This has really hurt our business.”The company mentioned in the post as being responsible for shipping the goods, Melbourne-based freight business Freight Net, has also been adversely affected.Freight Net company director Steve Hancock told AAP FactCheck over the phone that TT Express was their client but that the claim of goods being shipped to China was false and had been addressed by Victoria Police.“It’s been a crazy 48 hours for us, this is something that we’d never do. It’s a complete fabrication,“We have received threatening phone calls and also had vehicles doing slow drive by inspects of the office,” Mr Hancock said.Victoria Police told AAP FactCheck in a statement, which was also posted to their Facebook page, that they were aware of the claims.“Police have spoken to the company and found these claims to be false,” Victoria Police said.Mr Hancock told AAP FactCheck Freight Net received an apology from someone who uploaded an iteration of the March 20 Facebook post then deleted it.AAP FactCheck has seen the apology and a screenshot of the deleted post.The Facebook user, who AAP FactCheck has decided not to name, told Freight Net they asked Facebook to remove all other similar posts.“I am really sorry about what I have done. I was awake all night thinking about it,” the apology reads.It continues: “I thought if u [sic] have contacts with different charities would it help if I donate $1000 to one of them on behalf of Freight Net and TT Express?”. Police monitor distribution of toilet paper and other basic items at a Sydney supermarket.","http://archive.is/kBmCb,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/update-coronavirus-measures-24-March-2020,https://www.aap.com.au/be-considerate-plea-to-grocery-shoppers/,http://archive.is/pVn0b,http://archive.is/2nnCd#selection-5549.540-5549.666,http://archive.is/geHPA,https://www.facebook.com/victoriapolice/photos/a.223960551009422/3653232954748814/?type=3&theater",False claims of goods being shipped to China damage Melbourne companies,,,,,,

As of March 24 the virus has spread to more than 150 countries with 372,757 cases globally and 16,231 deaths. In Italy, there have been 63,927 cases and 6077 deaths recorded.The first cases in Italy were reported on January 31 in Rome. These were followed by outbreaks in the Lombardy region, where 16 million people were placed under quarantine in the first week of March. At that stage, the death toll in Italy was 230, with the mortality rate standing at 36 per day.The post urges people to stay home, which is in line with official advice in Australia and New Zealand on minimising social interactions to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However the problem is the photograph of an aircraft hangar filled with coffins is unrelated to COVID-19. The picture by news agency AFP was first published on October 5, 2013, following the sinking two days earlier of a boat carrying hundreds of African asylum-seekers off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The boat had left Libya 13 days before, carrying up to 500 people, according to survivors.A UNHCR report on the tragedy says that when the boat’s engine stopped off the Italian coast, asylum seekers set fire to clothing in their attempts to be seen, but “fishing boats passed without helping”. Only 155 people survived and 366 were killed. The AFP photo shows the coffins of some of the victims in a hangar of Lampedusa airport. The coffins of migrants inside a hangar of Lampedusa’s airport, Italy, on October 5, 2013.","https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200324-sitrep-64-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=703b2c40_2,http://archive.today/Yrz9K,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,http://archive.vn/a6kRQ,https://connect.aap.com.au/https/www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200324-sitrep-64-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=703b2c40_2,http://archive.today/QjsTp,http://archive.vn/fwInx,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/how-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19/social-distancing-for-coronavirus-covid-19,https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-novel-coronavirus-health-advice-general-public/covid-19-self-isolation/covid-19-wellbeing-self-isolation,http://archive.today/aC1KC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24380247,http://archive.vn/PEJEm,http://archive.today/PEJEm,http://archive.vn/0E2qU",Italy’s COVID-19 situation is dire but a photo of coffins is not from the coronavirus pandemic,,,,,,

The post ends with a claim that the CEOs stepped down because they “had warning before any of us. The elite always have the upper hand.” A screenshot of a Facebook post claiming CEOs have left their roles because of COVID-19. The AnalysisThe current COVID-19 pandemic has its origins in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where in December, 2019 the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan.The 11 corporations named in the post have either made CEO changes or announced changes that are yet to happen, however important details about the circumstances of each have been omitted from the post.The long-term CEO of The Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger, did step down on February 25, 2020, however Mr Iger has not left the company completely, instead taking the role of executive chairman until the end of the year.Match Group, the corporation that owns Tinder, OK Cupid and other online dating sites, announced on January 28 that CEO Mandy Ginsberg would be leaving the company. A company-wide email, obtained by news website Axios, from Ms Ginsberg explaining her move, said she was resigning for health and personal reasons.Hulu’s CEO Randy Freer’s departure was announced by the streaming company’s parent, The Walt Disney Company, on January 31. The move was widely expected following Disney’s takeover of Hulu and subsequent integration into its wider operations.Medmen, a company selling cannabis products in the US legalised market, announced on January 31 that is co-founder and CEO Adam Bierman was stepping down. The departure followed a downturn in the company’s performance and share price. Mr Bierman remains on the company’s board of directors.Les Wexner, the long-term CEO of Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands, stepped down from his role on February 20 following the sale of 55 per cent of the company to a private equity firm. The 82-year-old Wexner took up the role of “emeritus chairman”.Salesforce announced on February 25 that its co-CEO Keith Block would step down, however his former co-CEO Marc Benioff remains as CEO and also chairman of the customer relationship management systems group. Mr Benioff’s remaining as CEO renders false any claim that the company’s leader has exited ahead of some looming catastrophe.Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson dropped CEO Matt Levatich, announcing the change on February 28. That change followed the company losing sales and share market value during his five-year tenure. Computer and software giant IBM’s veteran CEO Viriginia Rometty announced her retirement on January 30 after 40 years with the company, with the 62-year-old staying on in the role of executive chairman until the end of 2020.T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere has not yet stepped down. The German telco announced on November 18 – before the 2019 novel coronavirus was first reported in China – that Mr Legere would depart his role on May 1, 2020.LinkedIn’s CEO Jeff Weiner has also not yet stepped down from his role and he is not leaving the company. The workplace and careers networking company announced on February 5 that Mr Weiner would step down as CEO effective from June 1, when his role will be filled by Ryan Roslansky. Mr Weiner will take on a new role of executive chairman at LinkedIn.And finally the CEO of credit card giant Mastercard has not stepped down. Mastercard announced on February 25 that Ajay Banga would step up to become executive chairman on January 1, 2021, after 10 well-regarded years in the chief executive role. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner will become executive chairman after 11 years as CEO.","http://archive.today/txiNr,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4,http://archive.today/dvC9L,http://archive.today/JvDXO,https://www.axios.com/match-group-ceo-mandy-ginsberg-steps-down-ddfeef5b-e444-4f67-93b0-d5d7902329f6.html,http://archive.today/Db8Xs,https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios,http://archive.today/OmG0J,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/31/business/medmen-cannabis-ceo-bierman-steps-down/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-victoria-s-secret-m-a-sycamore-partne/l-brands-sells-majority-stake-in-victorias-secret-ceo-wexner-to-step-down-idUSKBN20E1T7,http://archive.today/wKxq9,http://archive.today/ymS7s,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-28/harley-davidson-ceo-steps-down-after-five-year-sales-slump,http://archive.today/f42Hh,http://archive.today/kZCGo,http://archive.today/PYJWQ,http://archive.today/uXgsf",CEOs did not leave their jobs in anticipation of COVID-19,,,,,,

In the midst of these measures, rumours about a vast global conspiracy are being shared on Facebook.AAP FactCheck found two Facebook posts implicating Hollywood identities Tom Hanks, Oprah Winfrey and Harvey Weinstein in the conspiracy. The posts, while containing minor differences, make the same claims.A March 16 post claims Canadian prime minster Justin Trudeau “was served a criminal indictment by the U.S. for corporate and financial crimes,” and that actor Hanks was “arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia”.A March 15 post says Italy has shutdown airports “as over 80 Vatican and financial officials have been served same [sic] criminal indictments” and that “convicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities”.Both posts then claim “CEOs of some major world corporations have been indicted/arrested and some forced to resign all in the last 30-60 days” and that the “Lab-created Corona Virus is a cover up for mass mandatory vaccination agenda”.The final three paragraphs of both posts claim that “Trump will win 2020 elections”, “Some top religious leaders will be arrested or forced to resign”, and “H5N1 bird flu will be intentionally released this week out of China”.The two Facebook posts have collectively been viewed more than 400,000 times, shared over 1,400 times and have received over 700 likes. A Facebook post claims Canada’s PM and actor Tom Hanks have been arrested for various offences. The AnalysisCOVID-19 has caused major losses on global stock markets and forced entire countries into quarantine. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a press conference on March 18 that the ongoing crisis will last for “at least six months”.As the crisis goes on, Facebook posts sharing false information and conspiracy theories, like the March 15 and 16 Facebook posts, are being shared widely.The March 15 post, from an Australian user, claims: “This morning, at 4:30AM, our Prime Minister was served a criminal indictment by the US for corporate & financial crimes”.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has not been served a criminal indictment by criminal prosecutors in the United States. Since March 15 Prime Minister Morrison has appeared at press conferences and given interviews on Australia’s response to the coronavirus.The March 16 post from a user from New Zealand, based in the US, makes the same claim about another head of state: “This morning at 4:30 a.m., Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was served a criminal indictment by the U.S. for corporate and financial crimes”.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not been arrested. On March 16 he held a press conference outlining Canada’s ongoing response to COVID-19. Trudeau was photographed giving the address in front of his Ottawa residence, where he has been self isolating after his wife tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Canadian PM Justin Trudeau speaks at a press conference in Ottawa on March 16, 2020. The March 15 post goes on to say that “Tom Hanks was arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia refusing to fly back to USA.”Tom Hanks was not arrested for pedophilia on March 14, or at any other time. On March 12 the actor posted a message on Twitter telling his fans that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. The couple were released from a Gold Coast hospital on March 17, but remain in self isolation as they wait to be cleared of the potentially deadly virus, according to their son Chet Hanks.Both posts then claim “Italy’s airports have been completely shut down as over 80 of Vatican and financial officials have been served same criminal indictments for financial crime, pedophilia, child trafficking and sex abuse.”Several major airports remain open in Italy, according to the Australian Smart Traveller website. Milan’s airport (Milano Malpensa) was listing planes inbound as of March 20. Some regional airports, however, suspended flights in accordance with a ministerial decree — including the Toscana Aeroporti in Florence.AAP FactCheck found no evidence to support the claim of Vatican officials arrested. Any such news in the closely watched internationally recognised independent city-state, which maintains its own criminal justice system separate from Italy, would be widely reported.Both posts then state: “Convicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities… Instead of a 55-year sentence, he only received a 23-year sentence.”Mr Weinstein’s trial and conviction was a closely reported legal event and AAP FactCheck found nothing to support the claim of a supposed deal. Mr Weinstein was found guilty of sexual assault and rape in February and in March was sentenced to 23 years in prison by the New York State Supreme Court. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office recommended a maximum sentence of 29 years for the convictions. The Los Angeles District Attorney charged Weinstein with another four charges, he is yet to face court over the allegations.The posts also say Weinstein’s alleged plea deal included testimony against Oprah Winfrey among other famous figures. TV host Winfrey  addressed the rumour and videos purporting to show her arrest in a Twitter post: “It’s NOT TRUE. Haven’t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world”.The post then goes on to say: “The lab-created Corona virus was a cover-up for the mass mandatory vaccination agenda.”AAP FactCheck has previously debunked claims that that Covid-19 was created in a lab. Regarding the unsupported claim that the “Corona virus” is a “cover-up for the mass mandatory vaccination agenda”, there is currently no COVID-19  vaccine, nor any mass vaccination effort. While trials are underway there is not expected to be a vaccine for 12 to 18 months.","http://archive.is/xnXTH,http://archive.is/Lfh64 ,http://archive.is/xnXTH,http://archive.is/Lfh64,http://archive.is/bkaWg,http://archive.is/wip/xea77,http://archive.is/xnXTH,http://archive.is/Lfh64 ,http://archive.is/xnXTH ,http://archive.is/wip/xea77,http://archive.is/WTZP6,http://archive.is/xnXTH ,http://archive.is/JBwvw,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-trudeau-politicians-infections-intl/index.html,http://archive.is/Lfh64,http://archive.is/EWoYX,http://archive.is/n3i85,https://www.instagram.com/p/B90FuwUJNTh/,http://archive.is/0slXl,http://archive.is/rhEXQ,http://archive.is/5DTxI,http://archive.is/EZFAL,http://archive.is/VXdm7,http://archive.is/yTmEU,https://www.manhattanda.org/,http://archive.is/OvRT4,https://da.lacounty.gov/,http://archive.is/CJRH5,http://archive.is/T9EZZ,http://archive.is/YSMDS,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,http://archive.is/XpjMH,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237742-how-soon-will-we-have-a-coronavirus-vaccine-the-race-against-covid-19/","COVID-19 conspiracy about Hollywood arrests, CEO exits gets an F for “Fiction”",,,,,,

Their treatment will be FREE as @Cristiano will be paying for everything, including salaries of doctors & nurses.”The post has attracted more than 15,000 shares and received more than 2500 comments and 14,000 reactions. A Facebook post claims Ronaldo responded to COVID-19 by turning his hotels into hospitals. The AnalysisAs COVID-19 disrupts the sporting world it was announced by Italian club Juventus on March 12 that Cristiano Ronaldo would remain in quarantine in his native island of Madeira after Juventus teammate Daniele Rugani tested positive for COVID-19.On March 14, Ronaldo made a statement on his Instagram account to appeal to fans to follow the advice of the World Health Organization and public health bodies for advice on the pandemic. “Protecting human life must come above any other interests. I would like to send my thoughts to everyone who has lost someone close to them, my solidarity to those who are fighting the virus, like my teammate Daniele Rugani, and my continued support to the amazing health professionals putting their own lives at risk to save others,” reads the message.The following day, rumours appeared on social media suggesting Ronaldo was doing more than self-quarantining against COVID-19. The rumours were sourced to a story published by the Spanish national daily sport newspaper Marca and picked up on by the likes of Juventus News and a prominent sports journalist.On March 14, Juventus News, sourcing Marca, with a link to the newspaper’s since-deleted tweet, said: “Cristiano Ronaldo will transform his hotels in Portugal into hospitals to help in the fight against the pandemic. The CR7 hotels will become hospitals that can be used free of charge. The Juventus footballer will be the one who pays the doctors and workers.”SuperSportTV and FoxSportsAsia presenter Adriano Del Monte tweeted on March 14: “Cristiano Ronaldo’s @PestanaCR7 hotels will become hospitals next week, where patients in Portugal will be treated free of charge. He will pay all medical staff. #COVID19 What a man.”However, in the days following Marca’s report and its widespread sharing on social media, the story was debunked by Ronaldo’s hotel chain, Pestana CR7. The Sun newspaper in the UK reported that a hotel spokesperson told Dutch outlet RTL Nieuws: “We are a hotel. We are not going to be a hospital. It is a day like everyone else, we are and will remain a hotel. We are being phoned by the press. I wish you a nice day.”Global news and lifestyle publication Insider also reported the story had been denied by a hotel spokesperson and that since the original report had been deleted by Marca, they had been unable to find any reference to the story on the Marca site.A search by AAP FactCheck of the Marca website also failed to find any links to the original report.Cristiano Ronaldo has not publicly commented on the reports. Meanwhile, according to WHO, Portugal had 448 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 17. Cristiano Ronaldo has not publicly commented on the reports about his hotels regarding COVID-19.","http://archive.vn/HK7d4,http://archive.vn/uU159,https://www.pestanacr7.com/en,http://archive.vn/RZIBb,http://archive.vn/FK5BY,https://www.marca.com/en/,http://archive.vn/zL484,http://archive.vn/bdbdv,https://adrianodelmonte.com/,http://archive.vn/bdbdv,http://archive.vn/c91rg,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sport/voetbal/artikel/5057096/hotel-van-ronaldo-reageert-we-zijn-een-hotel-geen-hospitaal,http://archive.vn/FMQ44,http://archive.vn/MCZ3O",Cristiano Ronaldo is not converting his hotels into hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients,,,,,,
235,,,,False,,2020-03-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/covid-19-drinking-water-advice-dry-on-evidence/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementWith many countries around the world in lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis, a social media post is gaining traction by claiming that drinking water regularly will kill COVID-19. A Facebook post from March 10, 2020 reads: “SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. “WHY?” the post continues. “Even if the virus gets into your mouth… drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in the tummy…your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly… the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That’s very dangerous.”AAP FactCheck found more than 15 identical posts with the same claim and one had been viewed more than 26,000 times and received more than 430 shares.  A Facebook post claims that drinking water regularly will kill coronavirus. The AnalysisCOVID-19 has spread to more than 151 countries around the world since first reported in December 2019 and infected more than 179,000 people as of March 17, 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a pandemic on March 11.The Facebook post firstly claims the advice on sipping water comes from Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. However, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare lists no advisory about regular water intake on its website nor in its document, “Prevention Measures against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)”.The World Health Organization Philippines directly addressed whether drinking water protects against COVID-19 in a tweet. “While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection,” WHO tweeted on February 8. The World Health Organization Philippines says that drinking water doesn’t prevent coronavirus. Experts from the federal Department of Health and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) told AAP FactCheck that while hydration is important the claims mentioned in the post don’t stack up.For the claim that drinking water will wash the virus down the oesophagus and into the stomach, UNSW Professor in virology and molecular biology William Rawlinson told AAP FactCheck that COVID-19 particles are “too small to wash away” and infection can occur through the eyes, nose and throat. “It (COVID-19) binds to cells in the upper part of your nose and throat. Drinking water won’t necessarily wash it away because it gets stuck in the material up there,” he said. The World Health Organization has advised COVID-19 can be transmitted by touching eyes, nose or mouth.A Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that COVID-19 causes infection when the virus enters cells in the middle part of the throat, the oropharynx. “As the cells burst open and release the virus, viral particles can move down the respiratory tract and infect lower respiratory tract epithelial cells,”  the Department of Health spokesperson said.“This will occur whether or not water is sipped.”For the claim “once there in the tummy… your stomach ACID will kill all the virus”,  Prof Rawlinson said COVID-19 would most likely be killed by gastric acids if it somehow ended up in the stomach via food, however it could also potentially survive. “Gastric acid does kill viruses, not all of them but many,” he told AAP FactCheck. “But the virus can specifically stick to cells in the stomach.” The Department of Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that “gastric acid will not kill all viral particles”. “Hydration is important with any infection, however, sipping water will not prevent infection nor will it prevent infection spreading,” the spokesperson said.","http://archive.is/eoHbM#,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200317-sitrep-57-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=a26922f2_2,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert,https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/newpage_00032.html,https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000607629.pdf,https://twitter.com/WHOPhilippines/status/1225961563594510337/photo/1,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-william-rawlinson,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public,https://www.health.gov.au/",COVID-19 drinking water advice dry on evidence,,,,,,
236,,,,Partly False –,,2020-03-13,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/uncles-notes-for-guidance-on-covid-19-coronavirus-treatment-are-misguided/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAccurate advice about COVID-19 is critical during the current pandemic and, as people seek information, a social media post purporting to list symptoms and treatments warrants scrutiny.A March 1, 2020 Facebook post, with the headline “IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT – CORONAVIRUS” tells a story of someone receiving “notes on Coronavirus for guidance” from an uncle who “graduated with a master’s degree and worked in Shenzhen hospital”.The post then makes a series of statements and claims that reads:“1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold.2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours – so if you come into contact with any metal surface – wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but – a lot can happen during that time – you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.9. You should also gargle as a prevention.10. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. Can’t emphasise enough – drink plenty of water!”The post finishes with a timeline purporting to describe how COVID-19 infection might progress. It reads:“1. It will first infect the throat, so you’ll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you’re drowning. It’s imperative you then seek immediate attention.”The post has been viewed more than 50,000 times and shared more than 660 times.A Facebook post claims to list a series of symptoms and treatments for COVID-19 coronavirus. The AnalysisCOVID-19 has spread to more than 118 countries around the world since first reported in December 2019 and infected more than 125,000 people as of March 12, 2020, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the virus a pandemic.The post begins with the claim that COVID-19 symptoms do not include a runny nose and sputum but rather those were just symptoms of the common cold.According to the WHO, COVID-19 symptoms can include a runny nose.Professor Anthony Cunningham, an infectious diseases physician from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck sputum and a runny nose can be symptoms of COVID-19 however are more likely to be symptoms of the common cold.“4.5 per cent of people with the Coronavirus actually had nasal symptoms alone. It’s of course uncommon,” he said.The post also claims people with “coronavirus pneumonia” can display dry cough symptoms but not a runny nose.Prof Cunningham said not everyone infected with COVID-19 will develop pneumonia and that the claim was not correct because people infected with COVID-19 can still get a runny nose with cough and fever.“[COVID-19] causes a cold or a very mild pneumonitis in about 80 percent of people. It’s only about 15 per cent of people who get what would probably be identified by them as clinical pneumonia and five percent as critical,” he said. “[People who develop pneumonia from coronavirus] can have combinations of these symptoms.”The post suggests that exposing the virus to a temperature of 26 to 27 degrees will kill it because COVID-19 “is not heat-resistant”, and that it “hates the sun”.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is still not known how weather and temperature will affect the spread and transmissibility of the virus.Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist from the Australian National University, told AAP FactCheck 26 to 27 degrees Celsius temperatures won’t kill the virus.“Viruses survive quite well at lower temperatures and what would kill it is boiling it at heat more than lower temperatures. (26 to 27 degrees is) just room temperature. I don’t think it’s going to die from that,” he said.Prof Cunningham said sunlight could be effective against coronaviruses since UV light is usually effective in disinfection.“Exposure to UV light will actually kill off DNA. It will dry out everything so you’ll get a relative drop,” he said. “When a virus dries out, the infectivity drops substantially and chances of getting infected from dried out surfaces are extremely low.”While the post claims COVID-19 can travel “about 10 feet” (approximately 3m) in a sneeze, 2015 advice from the Australian government’s Department of Health states respiratory droplets projected in a sneeze or cough can travel for around one metre.The post makes a number of claims about the survival rate of the coronavirus on different surfaces, including that it lasts for at least 12 hours on a metal surface, six to 12 hours on fabrics and five to 10 minutes on someone’s hand.The WHO, however, says it is not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces but studies suggest that, like other coronaviruses, it may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.New, yet-to-be peer-reviewed research funded by the US National Institutes of Health has found virus can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days.Prof Collignon also said the COVID-19 virus could survive longer than five to 10 minutes on a person’s hands.The University of Sydney’s Prof Cunningham said the survival period depended on the state of the virus on the person’s hands and the environment.“Skin defences can actually then inactivate it. The real problem is wet material like mucus from someone else’s snot actually being there and you actually touching your face,” he said.Regarding the post’s claim that drinking warm water is “effective for all viruses” Prof Collignon said the claim was baseless, however it is important for people to stay hydrated if they have an illness.“If you’re dehydrated, you’re not going to fight it as well so having a reasonable fluid intake is a good idea, but whether it is warm or cold, it would make no difference,” he said.Prof Cunningham also rubbished the post’s claim that gargling salt water is a prevention,, saying the best gargling would do is provide symptomatic relief.“That’s just nonsense. (Gargling is) for symptoms,” he said.Prof Cunningham said the virus infects by getting into a person’s nose “not through your mouth”.The post ends with what it claims is a pathway and timeline of symptoms people experience when they get infected with COVID-19 including a throat infection in the first three to four days then pneumonic symptoms five to six days later and then difficulty in breathing due to nasal congestion.While these symptoms can appear in someone who has contracted COVID-19, Prof Collignon told AAP FactCheck not everyone will develop all of these and in the exact same order.“Some people just have a mild runny nose and sore throat, a bit of a fever – that’s it. But people can also develop pneumonia but that does not happen to everyone. That just happens to people who get really sick,” he said.Prof Cunningham said the virus would not infect the throat first due to the tough epithelium (a thin layer of tissue) down the back of the throat but rather the more delicate nasal epithelium.“It’s really the nasopharynx (the upper airway behind the nose) which can infect the throat,” he said.He said that infection can go down into the trachea causing pneumonia is correct, as is the post’s statement that with pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. People are taking many measures to protect themselves from COVID-19 coronavirus.","http://archive.today/3WbAC,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/20200312-sitrep-52-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=e2bfc9c0_2,https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/tony-cunningham.html#collapseBio,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html,https://medicalschool.anu.edu.au/people/academics/professor-peter-collignon-am,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/transmission-of-respiratory-diseases-and-managing-the-risk,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,http://archive.today/N4G32",“Uncle’s notes” for guidance on COVID-19 coronavirus treatment are misguided,,,,,,

The post is a meme headlined “Election Years” that then reads:“Sars – 2004, Bird Flu – 2008, Swine Flu – 2010, MERS – 2012, Ebola – 2014, Zika – 2016, Ebola – 2018, Corona – 2020”.Accompanying the meme is the caption: “You tell me”.The post has been viewed more than 148,000 times, has attracted over 280 likes and 210 comments.A screenshot of a Facebook post purporting to link disease outbreaks and election years.The AnalysisThe post, by an Australian Facebook user, does not specify in which country these “election years” were, so AAP FactCheck examined the dates and virus outbreaks listed in relation to Australian federal elections.There was an Australian federal election in 2004, however the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak did not begin in 2004. It first infected humans in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemic peaked in early 2003, ending in July of the same year, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says. According to an Australian federal Department of Health website there was only one case of SARS in Australia.Bird flu, also known as H5N1 influenza, was found in humans as far back as 1997, according to the WHO. Cases of the virus have been identified every year since 2003, except for 2018. In 2008 44 cases and 33 deaths were recorded worldwide but a WHO list shows the most deadly year for the virus was 2006 when 115 cases and 79 deaths occured. Cases of H5N1 infection have not been identified in Australia, according to the New South Wales Health Department. There was no federal election held in Australia in 2008.The Swine Flu (H1N1) pandemic began in 2009 and lasted until August 2010, according to a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  timeline. The 2009 outbreak resulted in 191 deaths in Australia, according to a Department of Health Report published in 2016. There was a federal election held on August 21, 2010 – 10 days after the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and eventually spread to 27 other countries, according to the WHO. From April 2012 to September 2019 over 900 deaths have been reported, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website states. There have been no cases of the disease documented in Australia, according to Department of Health website Health Direct. No federal election was held in Australia in 2012.Ebola was first identified in the late 1970s, but the largest outbreak of the disease was in 2014 – 2016. The two-year epidemic killed 11,300 people after sweeping through West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to the WHO. The virus reappeared in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, since then it has killed over 2,200 people in the country, a WHO website states. There have been no cases of the virus in Australia, according to the NSW Health Department. There were no federal elections in Australia in 2014 or 2018.According to the CDC the Zika Virus was first discovered in 1947, with the first large outbreak of the virus in 2007 on the Pacific island of Yap in Micronesia. The latest outbreak of the virus began in 2015 in Brazil, sweeping through countries in South and Central America. By 2017 cases had fallen dramatically, according to the CDC. Cases of the Zika virus have been reported in Australia, but all were caught overseas rather than onshore according to the Australian government’s Department of Health.There was a federal election held in Australia in 2016.COVID-19, referred to as “Corona” in the Facebook post, was first identified in China on December 8, 2019, according to a WHO situation report. The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre estimates over 110,000 people in 117 countries have been infected with the virus, including 112 people in Australia as of March 11. The 2019 federal election was held over six months before the outbreak of COVID-19 and no federal election has been scheduled for 2020.The Facebook post infers that elections occurred at the same times as various virus outbreaks however the inference fails under scrutiny. The post does not specify the countries in which elections were supposedly held and the years listed for disease outbreaks, of which some are inaccurate, do not all coincide with federal elections in Australia.Australia holds elections at the local, state and federal levels of government and at least one state or federal election has been held in Australia every single year since 2001. Around the world in 2020, 16 national elections will be held in different countries, according to the international non-profit Election Guide.Similar posts on Twitter and Facebook have emerged in the United States. The posts have the added text: “Every election year has a disease”. Another example is here. These posts loosely follow the four year cycle of  American presidential elections occurring in 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. However, there were no American presidential elections in 2010, 2014 or 2018.There were US presidential elections in 2008 and 2012 – the years linked in the post to MERS and Bird Flu outbreaks, however the only two cases of MERS in the country both occured in 2014, not 2012, and no cases of humans infected with the Bird Flu have been reported in the US. A similarly inconsistent pattern emerges when comparing virus outbreaks with other countries. For instance, during the 2002 – 2003 SARS outbreak two of the worst-affected countries, Taiwan and Singapore, didn’t hold presidential elections. Staff simulate drive-through coronavirus testing at Adelaide’s Repatriation Hospital","http://archive.is/IEULB,https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/,http://archive.is/Q0cQ9,http://archive.is/LMTNG,http://archive.is/P5ONl,http://web.archive.org/web/20200311002307/https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_avian_influenza_update.pdf,http://web.archive.org/web/20200311002211/https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2020_01_20_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1,http://archive.is/PXxQs,http://archive.is/pZZT1,http://archive.is/WlZIf,http://web.archive.org/web/20200208045744/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/review-2011-l/%24File/lessons%20identified-oct11.pdf,http://archive.is/iyB1a,https://web.archive.org/web/20200311002944/https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-situation-update,http://archive.is/Puzvn,http://archive.is/jGR5C,http://archive.is/0moui,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/diseases/Pages/ebola-virus-disease.aspx,http://archive.is/RpEf2,http://archive.is/tRDR4,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-factsheet-basics.htm,https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/,https://web.archive.org/web/20200311003435/https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200226-sitrep-37-covid-19.pdf,http://archive.is/zFEuT,http://archive.today/6OvZo,https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/,https://web.archive.org/web/20200311003919/https://www.aec.gov.au/Indigenous/files/iepp-factsheet-three-levels.pdf,http://www.electionguide.org/,http://archive.is/t1Gh3,http://archive.is/hc05n,http://archive.today/jclBL,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/us.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/north-american-lineage.htm,https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/country2003_08_15.pdf?ua=1",No vote of confidence for claims linking pandemics with election years,,,,,,

The hurricane resulted in 103 direct and indirect deaths, all in Texas with over half of directly related deaths occurring in the state’s most populous city, Houston, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Many people in Texas defied evacuation orders during the hurricane and instead decided to stock up on essentials and stay put.A number of brand names are visible on the products shown in the supermarket photograph.

And that’s what it is FRAUD!!!”The post has been viewed more than 316,000 times and received more than 6000 shares and more than 50 comments. A Facebook post makes several claims about the Red Cross’ distribution of bushfire donations. The AnalysisThe Australian Red Cross was formed in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. The charity works to ensure the safety of people affected by disasters, wars and other humanitarian issues.During the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire crisis, donations flooded into Australian Red Cross coffers as the fires tore through communities, but as the donations rose so did criticism of how the funds were being distributed.Regarding the donations figure, the Australian Red Cross website showed on February 15, a day before the Facebook post, that $140 million has been raised. The charity’s last update on February 20 put the figure at $150 million.The post claims that the charity “have only given out 7 million in $10,000 lots to some of the desperate people who have lost everything”. When the Facebook post was uploaded on February 16, the Australian Red Cross had paid $32 million in emergency grants, according to a media release dated February 13. In an email on March 3, the Australian Red Cross told AAP FactCheck that “more than $48 million has been given out in direct financial assistance”.On February 3 the Australian Red Cross announced they were doubling the funding for their immediate assistance program. In a statement the charity said extra financial assistance included: “An additional $10,000 payment to support people whose homes were destroyed and require further assistance, extending the total amount available to $20,000”.AAP FactCheck traced the source of the “7 million in $10,000 lots” quoted in the post to a TV interview with Australian Red Cross director Noel Clement (1 min 2 sec) on January 22. Clement told the Nine Network’s Today program that “we’ve allocated 30 million dollars of immediate relief for people who have lost their homes… They are $10,000 grants, we’ve paid 700 of those so far”.The Australian Red Cross lists a breakdown of emergency payments on its website and provided additional details to AAP FactCheck via email. The charity’s website states a $20,000 emergency grant is available for people “whose primary place of residence was destroyed” or “who have lost a next of kin”. The Red Cross also provides a $7500 injury grant for people “who have spent more than two days in hospital “as a direct result of bushfires” and a primary residence repair grant of $5000 for “homeowners whose homes have been structurally damaged”. There are currently no $10,000 grants available.The Red Cross offers a $20,000 grant for people “whose primary place of residence was destroyed”. The post also claims the charity “are keeping millions to be used for other use???” The Australian Red Cross website states $5 million will be used “for 24/7 support including evacuations, relief centres and outreach services” and “up to 10c in each dollar will be spent on admin support costs”.","http://archive.is/cNT16,https://www.redcross.org.au/about,http://archive.is/6fcTA,http://archive.is/zN6aQ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/australian-red-cross-defends-spending-10-of-bushfire-donations-on-office-costs,https://web.archive.org/web/20200215063143/https://www.redcross.org.au/news-and-media/news/australian-bushfires-how-we-are-using-funds,https://www.redcross.org.au/news-and-media/news/australian-bushfires-how-we-are-using-funds,https://web.archive.org/web/20200215063143/https://www.redcross.org.au/news-and-media/news/australian-bushfires-how-we-are-using-funds,http://archive.is/5BZhM,http://archive.is/DTkQ2,http://archive.is/1rle0,http://archive.is/1rle0#emergency,http://archive.is/1rle0#injury,http://archive.is/1rle0#repair,http://archive.is/oha9J",Australian bushfire donations post makes charity cross,,,,,,

The Chinese public and officials are killing dogs despite the World Health Organisation advice that the Chinese Coronavirus is not transmissible between dogs and humans. The eyes of the world are upon you China. How will you respond?”The post is linked to a yousign.org online petition (images contain graphic content) protesting the killing of dogs in China over COVID-19 and included three photos depicting the killing of dogs – one by a man in uniform.The post has attracted more than 200 shares and received more than 300 comments and 780 reactions. A post claims China officials are killing dogs despite WHO’s COVID-19 advice on dogs and humans. The AnalysisThe COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, and has since spread to 77 countries as of March 5, 2020. Nearly 3000 people have died and more than 93,000 have been infected as of March 4, 2020, according to the World Health Organization.The Facebook post makes two claims: the first that Chinese public and officials are killing dogs and inferring that it’s being done in response to the spread of COVID-19; and the second, that the World Health Organization (WHO) released advice that the virus cannot be transmitted between dogs and humans.Regarding the first claim, the photos accompanying the post are not related to the COVID-19 outbreak. The first photo has been online since at least March 30, 2013 and was linked to a Vietyo, a Vietnamese online youth chat forum. The second image has been online since at least March 12, 2014 and the third photo has been online since at least February 20, 2015.It is true there have been media reports of Chinese officials killing pets, including dogs, to stop the spread of coronavirus with examples here, here and here.In late February, stories began to emerge concerning the positive test for COVID-19 in a pet dog in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) confirmed the story, with a spokesman saying on February 28 that a pet dog had been tested “weak positive” to COVID-19.The official statement said a dog of a patient infected with COVID-19 had been picked up from a residential flat and sent to an animal keeping facility in Hong Kong, following a referral from the health department.“Oral, nasal and rectal samples were collected for testing of COVID-19 virus,” the statement said. “The nasal and oral cavity samples were tested weak positive to COVID-19 virus. The dog does not have any relevant symptoms.”However, the AFCD also affirms WHO’s advice when it says: “At present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected with COVID-19 virus or can be a source of infection to people.”More recently, a video posted by animal activist group Nanchong Missing Animal Aid Group to Weibo and another by an animal rights activist appear to be the source of stories claiming Chinese authorities are ordering and carrying out the killing of household pets in the township of Longcan in Peng’an County in Nanchong.The claim, and the videos, have been widely circulated by media, such as The Daily Mail and The Sun. The videos purport to show bloodied dogs in the back of a truck and a man in a soldier’s uniform touching a lifeless dog with a stick. However, there is nothing to verify the circumstances behind the content in the videos. The Mail reports local authorities have denied they killed the dogs to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the government of Longcan said they culled the dogs to control rabies.On the claim concerning WHO’s advice, the United Nations public health organisation has released a statement on the spread of COVID-19 by household pets. On a web page titled, “Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) advice for the public: Myth busters”, WHO directly addresses the question: Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (COVID-19)?“At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans,” the WHO response reads.World Health Organization advice is there is no evidence that dogs can be infected with COVID-19.","http://archive.ph/0n1yp,http://archive.ph/0n1yp,https://www.yousign.org/media-t-5866?fbclid=IwAR1pZSBz5u2Nke4luCDlxEhg9JUGeCVEErd7Pn_KtWo8xKvr6wyxeBKKq8w,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://archive.is/tRBKo,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200304-sitrep-44-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=783b4c9d_2,https://tineye.com/search/98f3091cc97d1d062fccadc19a94d09d962f8088?page=1,https://archive.is/ndXKr,https://tineye.com/search/2edbb6c288f4023a6fd51e9f9247cb16fad2092b?page=1,http://archive.ph/fVXdO,https://time.com/5793363/china-coronavirus-covid19-abandoned-pets-wuhan/,https://archive.is/VWwbG,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1245331/Coronavirus-latest-Chinese-officials-execute-dogs-carry-disease-china-wuhan,http://archive.ph/wxEG6,http://archive.ph/xYlbr,http://www.pengan.gov.cn/,https://www.britannica.com/place/Nanchong,http://archive.ph/YJP9E,http://archive.ph/Jxb6A,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters",Social media photos are not of dogs being killed because of coronavirus fears,,,,,,

The government has also raised the level of advice for those travelling to Italy, Japan and Mongolia in a bid to stop the spread of the disease.In NSW, there were 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 6, including one at a school in northern Sydney, six at a northern Sydney nursing home and two traced to an event at a south-western Sydney hospital.The screenshotted post claims staff at an unnamed hospital in the central NSW town of Dubbo say there may be a confirmed COVID-19 case in the area.AAP FactCheck contacted NSW Health via email on March 2 to ask if there had been any report of a COVID-19 case in Dubbo.A spokesperson for the agency confirmed in an emailed response that there had been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in Dubbo.Authorities say the best way for people to protect themselves and their families against the virus is to clean their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, cover their nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing with a tissue or a flexed elbow, avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms, and to stay home if they are sick.Health Minister Brad Hazzard (left) and NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant have been giving regular updates on COVID-19.","http://archive.is/GcgEp,http://archive.today/VUv71,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert,http://archive.today/QoRhS,http://archive.today/kD2BZ,https://dubbo.com.au/visit/about,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#2-1",NSW COVID-19 cases rise but regional centre not on the list,,,,,,
242,,,,False,,2020-03-05,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/cabbage-walking-vegans-story-wanders-away-from-its-artistic-origins/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAn article being shared on Australian and overseas social media groups claims “vegans” are walking cabbages instead of dogs in a purported trend among young people that helps to cure depression. A Facebook post purports to show “vegans” walking cabbages in an effort to cure depression. The article, from the website National File was shared on a Facebook group called Fraser Anning Support Group on February 18, 2020, with the poster commenting “No words”. That poster had shared the post from a group called “Exposing the modern day left”.Fraser Anning is a former federal senator for Queensland.The February 6, 2020 article says a “new trend has emerged where young vegan adults, instead of walking a pet such as a cat or a dog, take cabbages for walks on a leash”.The National File article quotes a psychiatrist named Wen Chao stating: “The idea is simple – you feel as lonely and as simple as a cabbage, so you begin to act like one and befriend one.”An unnamed “vegan student” is quoted as saying: “It’s a way by which depression and loneliness can be escaped; I feel free, I feel unchained-going for a walk with (the cabbage) makes me feel fully recharged.” The report includes a photo of a group of young people dragging cabbages with leashes.National File describes itself as “a bold new media project” focused on news topics “pertaining to the New Right”.The National File report has been posted more than 40 times on Facebook, including posts by Australian groups here and by Facebook groups overseas here and here. In total the report has received more than 43,000 interactions, been shared more than 3,900 times and received more than 14,000 comments.The AnalysisStories about teens walking cabbages as a cure for loneliness started to appear in May 2014 with The Daily Star, Metro UK and the Huffington Post all reporting on the ‘craze’.The original report was published on May 2, 2014, by the Austrian Times, a now-shuttered news outlet that was part of Central European News (CEN) a news agency run by English-born journalist Michael Leidig.The 2014 Austrian Times story, titled “China’s Cabbage Patch Kids”, contains many of the same quotes from psychiatrist Wen Chao and student Lui Ja Chen as the 2020 National File story.However the Austrian Times article does not mention vegans or quote a “vegan student” as the National File article does.A story titled “Teens Are So Lonely, They’re Taking Cabbages On Leashes For Walks” appeared in the Huffington post in 2014. The piece attributed a quote and linked to the Austrian Times story. The American news website and blog later updated and corrected the piece after it was debunked by Chinese media outfit thatsmags.com and gaming website Kotaku. “The teens pictured walking cabbages on leashes were taking part in a performance art piece,” reads the correction.Beijing-based artist Han Bing told the Wall Street Journal in 2014 that people were walking cabbages at a music festival as part of a performance art piece he had devised.In a 2014 interview with The New York Times, Mr Han said he has been walking cabbages as an artistic statement since 2000. “At the beginning they treated me like a psychopath. Now young people are more open and accept it, they even choose to walk cabbages,” he said.In 2015 Buzzfeed published a report on an investigation into the veracity of some stories published by Central European News. The story titled “The King of Bull Sh*t News” said evidence suggested “an alarming proportion” of CEN’s “weird news” stories were “based on exaggeration, embellishment, and outright fabrication”. The Austrian Times cabbage-walking story was among the examples cited.In 2016 Michael Leidig and CEN launched a $US11 million libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed in response to the story. The case was rejected in March, 2019 and an appeal was thrown out in December 2019, with the US Court of Appeals ruling that the “plaintiffs [Leidig and CEN] offered no evidence regarding the accuracy of the story about young people walking cabbages in China out of loneliness”.Mr Leidig’s lawyer was reported as saying there would be a challenge to the Court of Appeals ruling. A man walks past a pile of cabbages on a Beijing street.","http://archive.is/wip/8709t,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=273829,http://archive.is/bdlaR,https://nationalfile.com/about/,http://archive.today/uebyY,http://archive.is/idfbm,http://archive.today/4lUXZ,http://archive.is/RYsDi,http://archive.is/He7r0,http://archive.is/6SrRm,https://web.archive.org/web/20150321210324/http://austriantimes.at/news/Around_the_World/2014-05-02/50857/Chinas_Cabbage_Patch_Kids,https://cen.at/,https://cenagency.co.uk/,https://www.harpercollins.com/author/cr-105804/michael-leidig/,https://archive.is/KKsra#selection-5913.0-5913.65,http://archive.is/6SrRm,https://archive.is/R0ShA,http://archive.is/PG75g,http://www.hanbing.work/about,http://archive.is/stB1z,http://archive.is/YFh1A,https://archive.is/QVY7n/image,http://archive.is/wip/DWxBl,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/27/buzzfeed-lawsuit-central-european-news-michael-leidig,http://archive.today/mw4vk,http://archive.today/6KMuA,http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/fed4127f-a441-4332-af1e-14ee8e420b93/17/doc/19-851_so.pdf,http://archive.today/YxYcF",“Cabbage-walking vegans” story wanders away from its artistic origins,,,,,,

I am FED up with our country bending over to the rest of the world to APPEASE everyone except AUSSIES.”The text is accompanied with an image showing a Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate eggs box next to a Turkish Delight eggs box.The post has continued to circulate since 2017, drawing more than 116,000 shares and more than 800,000 views. It has also attracted more than 16,000 reactions and 3,500 comments. A Facebook post claims Cadbury removed the word ‘Easter’ from the packaging of its egg collection. The AnalysisIn March 2016, UK tabloid newspaper The Daily Star published an article titled, “Chocolate makers ban ‘Easter’ from eggs to stop ‘offending’ other religions”. The article listed several UK products which did not include the word ‘Easter’ on the packaging including, Cadbury’s Dairy Milk “Egg Hunt Pack”, Nestlé’s Aero’s “chocolate egg with bubbly bars”, and Sainsbury’s “milk chocolate egg” brand. The story included reaction from “religious campaigners” unhappy about the word being left off chocolate products during the Easter period. It was also picked up in Australia by Liberal MP Craig Kelly in March 2016 who wrote on his Facebook page, “WHO TOOK THE “EASTER” OUT OF EASTER EGGS ? : Even our chocolate now has to be politically correct.” In his post, Mr Kelly wrote, “Products that for generations have been marketed as “Easter Eggs” by Cadbury, Lindt, Nestle, M & M’s, Woolworths Home brand, and others – this year, the word “Easter” has mysteriously disappeared from their packaging.” Former senator Glenn Lazarus also shared a post about “Easter” missing on chocolate egg products saying he was “really offended”. He later deleted the post. Paul Chatfield, director of marketing for Cadbury, told AAP FactCheck in an email the claim the company had removed the word ‘Easter’ from its packaging and advertising was not true.“We haven’t removed the word ‘Easter’ from our products,” Mr Chatfield said.“Easter is communicated across our marketing and advertising campaigns, and both the word and theme feature on our packaging, website and social pages.” Cadbury says claims the company removed the word ‘Easter’ from its packaging are not true. During the 2019 Easter period, Cadbury Australia featured multiple Facebook posts involving their products and the word ‘Easter’, including an Adult Gift Box with the words “Happy Easter” on the box, a gift box and chocolate bunnies with Easter mentioned in the promotional material.Cadbury also responded to a Facebook user’s comment that the words “Happy Easter” did not appear on Cadbury Easter egg products, saying “Our Easter products are sold at Easter time and Easter – the word and theme – features clearly on numerous products in numerous products in our range … We’ve used Easter on our communications at this time of year for years, and will continue to do so in future.” Mr Chatfield told AAP FactCheck there are some Cadbury egg products that do not have ‘Easter’ displayed on their packaging such as the Mini Eggs range because there was not “room on the pack for the word itself”.He said customers would easily be able to see the word ‘Easter’ on a shelf of Cadbury products in the supermarket.“Our Easter products are clearly known as Easter products, due to the Easter-themed imagery on pack, the type of product they are, and the fact that they are only available at this special time of year.”","http://archive.is/ARKDA,https://archive.is/BN2bC,http://archive.is/mgutS,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=108616,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjVuCGk0Wpe3kSu2pyKIfOVJODxbcsod/view?usp=sharing,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=896519060688187,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2266987570210766,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=785256088512261,http://archive.is/LLk5B,https://shop.coles.com.au/a/national/product/cadbury-mini-egg-tube",‘Easter’ removed from Cadbury eggs claim melts under scrutiny,,,,,,
244,,,,False,,2020-03-04,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/sudanese-crime-statistics-dont-tell-real-story/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA Facebook post lists a series of statements claiming to be statistics about crimes associated with people of Sudanese origin in Victoria.Originally published on March 19, 2018, the post has continued to be shared and had a resurgence in early 2020. It begins: “4,700,000 people live in Victoria 12,500 are Sudanese  6000 Sudanese have been persons of interest in crimes in Victoria”.It continues “Sudanese make up less than 0.01% of Victoria yet make up 4% of recorded crime”.It goes on to claim that 24 people have died due to “Sudanese actions,” that 2004 people were admitted to hospital “due to Sudanese” and that “10,000+ have been assaulted by Sudanese”.It then claims “$4 Billion spent on housing, centrelink, property damage, front line staff, court cases, treating the victims and Insurance claims. That’s 320,000 per Sudanese per year”.The post is accompanied by a photo of an African man holding a knife to his throat, with other men in the background.Since being uploaded in 2018 the post has been shared over 4,500 times, commented on 2,100 times and in the past three months has received over 22,000 views. A post lists statements claiming to be statistics on crimes regarding Sudanese people in Victoria. The AnalysisThe north-east African country of Sudan has struggled with famines and political upheaval; including a civil war that lasted from 1983 – 2005.Sudan has struggled with famines and political upheaval; including a civil war from 1983 – 2005. The 2018 post claims that “4,700,000 [people] live in Victoria” and “12,500 are Sudanese”. According to the published Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures available in March, 2018, the population of Victoria was 6,358,900 people. The most recent census figures, from 2016, show 5,665 people living in Victoria were born in Sudan and 6,518 people with Sudanese ancestry live in the state.Victoria Police and Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) both told AAP FactCheck that they do not collect statistics in relation to “persons of interest” in crimes and had no data that would support a claim that “6000 Sudanese have been persons of interest in crimes in Victoria”.The post goes on to claim that “Sudanese make up less than 0.01% of Victoria yet make up 4% of recorded crime”. The ABS told AAP FactCheck in an email that people of Sudanese and South Sudanese origin account for 0.15% of Victoria’s population. According to data provided to AAP FactCheck by CSA, people of Sudanese and South Sudanese background account for 1.1 per cent of alleged offenders in Victoria.In relation to the post’s claim of “24 people dead due to Sudanese actions, 2004 admitted to hospital due to Sudanese”, the Victorian Department of Health said they did not collect any data that could verify the claims made in the post. CSA told AAP FactCheck they don’t collect data related to deaths or hospital admissions.The post also claims “10,000+ have been assaulted by Sudanese”. Data provided to AAP FactCheck from CSA shows people born in Sudan or South Sudan were recorded as the alleged offender in an assault 181 times out of a state total of 15,607 assaults, and as the alleged offender in a serious assault 263 times from a total of 13,100 serious assaults in the year from October 2017 to September 2018.The post’s statement “$4 Billion spent on housing, centrelink, property damage, front line staff, court cases, treating the victims and Insurance claims” combines a number of different elements for which AAP FactCheck was unable to find supporting evidence. Spokespeople for the Department of Health and Human Services Victoria, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Department of Social Services told AAP FactCheck they do not categorise spending based on specific community or ethnic groups.The photo used in the post is not related to Sudan.

In the first excerpt, a sentence is highlighted saying, “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe.” The excerpt also says the illness will vanish, reappear in 2030, and then “disappear completely”.The second excerpt features dialogue from Koontz’s novel. In it, two characters discuss a biological weapon called ‘Wuhan-400.’ Called the “perfect weapon,” it afflicts only human beings and no other living creature can carry the microorganism.The Facebook post has been viewed more than 490,000 times and shared nearly 5000 times.A Facebook post claims The Eyes of Darkness by Dean Koontz predicted the coronavirus outbreak.  The AnalysisThe coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, China in late December 2019, and has since spread to 58 countries. Nearly 3000 people have died and more than 87,000 have been infected as of March 1, 2020, according to the World Health Organization.The Facebook post claims that Dean Koontz‘s book The Eyes of Darkness predicted the coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, however the book’s first edition was published in 1981 and referred to an outbreak in Russia of a virus called “Gorki-400.”In the 1981 publication of The Eyes of Darkness, published under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, the story was that the virus was developed in laboratories outside a Russian city named “Gorki”.When The Eyes of Darkness was re-released under Koontz’s own name in 1989, the Cold War between the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the United States was nearing the end after the former began an era of “glasnost” or increased openness. A revision of The Eyes of Darkness changed the virus name to ‘Wuhan-400’ and its origin to China. Wuhan, an industrial centre for most of China’s history, is also home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The fact checking website Snopes described the mention of ‘Wuhan-400’ in Koontz’s book as “nothing more than a coincidence”. Apocalyptic viruses are often used in fiction writing such as Stephen King’s book The Stand.The post’s first excerpt that mentions an outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness in 2020 comes from a book by the late self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne, End Of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About The End of the World.Browne was a frequent guest on TV talk shows and wrote more than 40 books before her death in 2013. The Skeptical Inquirer published an article examining Browne’s predictions and found that of 115 cases examined, her confirmable accuracy rate was 0 per cent. She also was convicted of fraud in 1992.The ‘Wuhan-400’ virus in Koontz’s novel is a biological weapon created in a laboratory, however the World Health Organization said the Covid-19 virus was most likely developed in wild animals, likely to be bats.AAP FactCheck has previously examined claims that the Covid-19 virus originated in a laboratory and found no evidence.Koontz has made no comment about The Eyes of Darkness social media posts and AAP FactCheck sought for comment from Koontz’s publishers, Penguin Random House NZ, but received no reply at the time of publication. US author Dean Koontz has made no comment about The Eyes of Darkness social media posts.","http://archive.is/fjY6j,http://archive.is/cz7rk,http://archive.is/nKFuB,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200301-sitrep-41-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6768306d_2,https://www.deankoontz.com/,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671827847/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Eyes_of_Darkness/U270yU756JoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=gorki-400,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Eyes_of_Darkness/U270yU756JoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=gorki-400,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-koontz-book/partly-false-claima-1981-book-predicted-the-coronavirus-2019-outbreak-idUSKCN20M19I,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dean-koontz-predicted-coronavirus/,https://www.amazon.com/Stand-1st-Stated-First/dp/B0060YHM2O,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/26/viral-image/book-end-days-described-illness-2020-not-wuhan-400/,https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/302984/end-of-days-by-sylvia-browne/,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/arts/television/sylvia-browne-dies-at-77-self-proclaimed-psychic.html,https://skepticalinquirer.org/2010/03/psychic-defective-sylvia-brownes-history-of-failure/?%2Fsi%2Fshow%2Fpsychic-defective-sylvia-brownes-history-of-failure%2F,https://quackwatch.org/cases/crim/browne/complaint/,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200221-sitrep-32-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=4802d089_2,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/119887345/sorry-internet--author-dean-koontz-did-not-predict-coronavirus",A novel published in 1981 did not predict the 2019 coronavirus,,,,,,

The tome was compiled by Roman gourmand Marcus Gavius Aspicius in the late 4th or early 5th century AD and lists brains as an ingredient for sausages, stews and puddings.Around the world, brains and other offal remain on the menu even if their profile has slipped in Australian and many western diets.Brains found their way onto the plates of Australian households as far back as the 1800s. Edward Abbott’s The English and Australian Cookery Book, originally published in 1864, lists recipes such as a Slippery Bob, comprised of kangaroo brains, flour, pepper and emu fat. The book describes the dish as “bush fare”, requiring “a good appetite and excellent digestion”.Some Australians may have been served crumbed brains during their childhood and the offal recently made a mainstream comeback of sortsThe Facebook post shows an image of canned brains purportedly bearing the Heinz brand with the caption stating: “Canned in Australia (1980s)”.There is no record of Australian supermarket shelves featuring a Heinz canned brains product. AAP FactCheck contacted global food group Kraft Heinz, owner of the Heinz brand, about the post.A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz responded in an email that the post did not look genuine.“We do not have any record of this product, and the representation of the Heinz logo does not accord with any of our registered trademarks, past or present,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that as far as the company was aware it had never sold canned brains in Australia.“A check was carried out on a database of Heinz products in Australia and it didn’t appear there,” the spokesperson said.AAP FactCheck conducted a reverse image search on the photo and found three results linked to the website picclick.co.uk. The earliest example was dated May 29, 2018. The site displays the photo as part of an Ebay auction item from a vendor called Starporium and the product title reads: “Vintage Heinz Canned Brains Infant Food Zombie Australia Real”.AAP FactCheck sought comment from the Ebay user regarding the origin of the image but received no response at the time of publication.","http://archive.ph/X8jbk,https://www.britannica.com/topic/cooking/The-evolution-of-world-cuisines,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Gavius-Apicius,https://www.facsimilefinder.com/facsimiles/apicius-de-re-coquinaria-facsimile,https://www.more.com/lifestyle/exercise-health/offal-healthy-eating-liver-brains-and-other-variety-meats/,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-9562000/view?partId=nla.obj-9575214#page/n56/mode/1up/search/brain,https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-9562000/view?partId=nla.obj-9589086#page/n129/mode/1up/search/slippery+bob,https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/crumbed-brains-with-peas-and-lemon-20140319-351nz,https://mkr.7plus.com.au/alex-emilys-jamon-wrapped-lamb-brains-with-caper-mayonnaise,https://www.kraftheinzfoodservice.com.au/about-us,http://archive.is/8hXG0",The offal truth about “canned in Australia” brains,,,,,,

It also states that the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay on January 18, although it omits the year, which was 1788.It then states that “the 26th was chosen as Australia day for a different reason” without mentioning what that reason is.The post goes on to say that in the “extravagant bicentenary celebrations of 1988” Sydney-siders “decided Captain Cook’s landing should become the focus of the Australia Day commemoration”. Professor Helen Irving, a constitutional law expert from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the post is “full of confusions”.Prof Irving said the 1988 bicentenary marked the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney in 1788.“The first boat of the First Fleet landed at Botany Bay on 18 January, 1788, but the Fleet then moved to Port Jackson (what became Sydney), where on 26 January 1788, the British flag was raised,”  she told AAP FactCheck.“It was the First Fleet’s arrival in 1788 that was marked at (the bicentenary) in 1988, not Cook’s arrival.”Reports and photos from and about 1988 show the First Fleet was the focus of Sydney Harbour bicentenary celebrations.Another claim in the post is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people born after January 1, 1921 gained the status of “British subjects” under the Nationality Act 1920.A report titled, ‘Australian citizenship: a chronology of major developments in policy and law’ in the Australian parliamentary library states the Nationality Act 1920 “introduced a definition of a ‘natural born’ British subject and residence requirements for naturalisation”.These requirements for being a British subject included being born in a country ruled by the king or allied with the king, having a father who was a British subject, or being born on a British ship.However, Prof Irving said everyone born in Australia before the Nationality Act 1920 was already considered a British subject under common law.“The 1920 Nationality Act simply put this common law principle into legislation for the first time,” she said.On January 26, 1949, the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect. This law created Australian citizenship and the conditions by which it could be acquired.The post claims that before the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 was enacted, Aboriginal people in Australia were not protected by law.Prof Irving told AAP FactCheck that under the 1948 Act, everyone born in Australia became simultaneously Australian citizens and British subjects.“There was no distinction between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians,” she said.Prof Irving said Aboriginal people held British subject status before 1948, in common with other Australians, and after 1948 they held Australian citizenship.“As subjects/citizens, they were subject to and protected by the law in the same manner as non-Aboriginal Australians,” she said.“Aboriginal people were certainly subject to special laws that applied to them specifically as Aboriginal Australians, and these laws were often oppressive and discriminatory, but these laws did not discriminate on the basis of the holding or not holding of citizenship.”The Nationality and Citizenship Act took effect on January 26, 1949 and the post claims this is the reason why Australia marks its national day on that date.Prof Irving told AAP FactCheck the claim was incorrect as Australia Day was already celebrated on January 26 before 1948.“The date was not chosen to celebrate the proclamation of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948,” she said.“Rather, the 26th of January was chosen as the date of the proclamation of the Act because it was already celebrated as Australia Day.”A parliamentary research paper by Margaret Harrrison-Smith notes that Tasmania celebrated “Foundation Day” on January 26 from 1888. Victoria and Western Australia also celebrated the date in the early 1900’s and in 1930 the Australian Natives’ Association suggested an annual “Australia Day” celebration.A year later Victoria first adopted the name ‘Australia Day’ and since 1946, January 26 “has been recognised throughout Australia as Australia Day and a public holiday taken on or around that date,” according to the research paper. Since 1946, January 26 has been officially recognised as the date for Australia Day. In September 1948, then-immigration minister Arthur Calwell told federal parliament that when the Nationality and Citizenship Act became law “it will be proclaimed on Australia Day, the 26th of January, 1949”.","https://archive.is/5gPiI,https://www.australiaday.org.au/about-australia-day/history/,https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/prime-minister-and-cabinet/national-australia-day-council-limited/national-australia-day-council-limited-board,https://www.tourism.australia.com/en/about/our-organisation.html,https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/terra-australis-australia,https://history.cass.anu.edu.au/people/frank-bongiorno,https://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/prince-charles-parade-monument-track-kurnell-nsw-australia,https://sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/helen-irving.html,https://sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/helen-irving.html,https://archive.is/1Io1Q,https://www.smh.com.au/national/30-years-on-pomp-and-protest-as-sydney-celebrates-the-bicentenary-20180126-h0optp.html   ,http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/print/?ID=24750,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/0910/AustCitizenship#_Toc224109061,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/citizenship-act,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22library/prspub/VUN00%22,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22hansard80/hansardr80/1948-09-30/0105%22","No, this is not “the real reason” Australia Day is celebrated on January 26",,,,,,

These are real photos of real women. We cannot forget. This is Islam”.The post, on a page called “Left & Right of Politics (The Experiment)” has been shared and liked more than 25 times.The image, which has also been posted on sharing site Imgur has been shared by other Australian groups here and here.

Selig, “The Man Who Invented Hollywood”.Former resident film historian at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Anthony Slide said during a 2015 lecture at the University of California’s Hammer Museum that the silent film was successful, but the eight reels of original film and its copies were lost. (see 26:45 mark)In the late 1990s a 25-minute montage of footage from the film was discovered, Mr Slide said.AAP FactCheck asked Dr Carla Garapedian of the Armenian Film Foundation about the provenance of the image used in the Facebook post.Dr Garapedian said the image was not a photograph of the actual events that occurred around 1915 but rather an image from the production of the Auction of Souls/Armenia Ravished movie.“Those are actresses on a film set in California, not Ottoman Turkey,” she said in an emailed response.Dr Garapedian said eyewitness accounts described women being impaled in “horrible” deaths but crucifixion as depicted in the film was not used.Mr Slide said the crucifixion image is “the most famous image from the film… filmed actually, we believe, on the beach at Santa Barbara”.

It also claims onions can have  harmful effects, such as a cut onion becoming “highly poisonous” if left overnight and that dogs should never be fed onions because their stomachs cannot metabolise them.The post has been shared more than 3,800 times, seen by more than 190,000 people in three months and has attracted more than 800 reactions. A Facebook post claims onions have disease-fighting, germ-absorbing abilities. The AnalysisRelating the story of the supposed flu-surviving farmer, the post tells a story that, when a doctor examined the onions left by the farmer’s wife, “he did find the flu virus in the onion”. “It obviously absorbed the bacteria, therefore, keeping the family healthy”, the post concludes.The post interchanges the terms “virus” and “bacteria” but, as stated on the Australian  government’s healthdirect.gov.au website, viruses and bacteria are two different things. While they both cause “mild to serious infections”, a bacterium is a single complex cell which can survive on its own inside or outside the body while a virus is not a cell and needs a host in order to multiply.Dr Emma Beckett, a molecular nutritionist at the University of Newcastle, told AAP FactCheck in an email response that onions do not absorb bacteria or viruses from the air to protect humans.“There is absolutely no evidence to back up this claim,” Dr Beckett said.“Stop and think about how dangerous onions would be to eat if that happened.”The post also claimed an onion would turn black if left next to someone who was sick but Dr Beckett told AAP FactCheck that an onion left anywhere long enough will turn black.“After any plant food has been picked it eventually runs out of sources of energy and the cells start to break down, when that happens bacteria will grow and it will rot,” she said.“But leaving it near a sick person won’t change the rate at which this happens.”The post goes on to claim that onions have “powerful antibacterial, antiseptic properties”.Dr Beckett said part of this claim is correct in that onions are “slightly acidic”, meaning they will “inhibit the growth of some bacteria, and the sulphur compounds in them have some antibacterial properties”.“But these effects would be from juicing or otherwise extracting these elements and using them in medicines or as concentrates, and they still wouldn’t be as powerful as other antibiotics or cleaning products,” she told AAP FactCheck.“You wouldn’t get a benefit through eating them or having onions sitting near you.”Claims about onions being able to absorb viruses and bacteria from the air have been debunked in the past by fact checkers Hoax Slayer, Snopes, who traced the earliest instance of the practice back to 1900, and Canada’s McGill University.The second part of the post, under the headline “LEFT OVER ONIONS ARE POISONOUS”, purports to tell about a tour of a mayonnaise factory where the post’s author was told by the tour guide that leftover onions could become poisonous.The post claims “onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions” and that a sliced onion is “not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag” in the fridge because it is “already contaminated” by having been cut open and left out.AAP FactCheck has previously debunked the claim that onions are a bacteria magnet and would not be safe to consume even if it was placed in an airtight container and stored in the fridge.In that check, Simone Austin, a dietician and spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, told AAP FactCheck she had not seen any research to support such a claim and that onions contain very little protein.“Foods that are going to develop bacteria are often due to protein in the food,” Ms Austin said.Once chopped, Ms Austin advised onions should be stored correctly in a container so no moisture can cause mould issues.Onions Australia, the representative body of the industry, states that if you only use part of the onion, it can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to four days.The post ends with the claim that dogs “should never eat onions” because “their stomachs cannot metabolize onions”. Onions are a no-no for dogs but other claims about their dangers to humans are far-fetched. Kasra Ahmadi, a poisons specialist from the Australian Animal Poisons Centre, told AAP FactCheck in an email onions contain compounds called disulfides and thiosulphates which can be toxic to cats and dogs if ingested.Mr Ahmadi said disulfides and thiosulfates “are metabolised by compounds that then cause oxidative damage to red blood cells resulting in anaemia”.“The severity can range from minor gastrointestinal effects to a potentially serious, life-threatening anaemia which can result in lack of oxygen to tissues,” he said.According to Mr Ahmadi, toxicosis is dependent on the amount ingested and the weight of the dog, with the risk and severity of toxicosis increasing with the amount ingested.“Poisoning has occurred from the ingestion of whole raw onions but also from chopped, cooked and dehydrated onions as well as products containing onion powder,” he said.Dr Anne Fawcett, a veterinarian and lecturer at the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck in an email onions contain toxic components that can damage red blood cells, leading to anaemia in a range of species including dogs and cats.“As onions … are potentially toxic to dogs (and cats), it is good practice to avoid feeding onions … to companion animals altogether,” she said.In response to the claim that dogs’ stomach cannot metabolise onions, Dr Fawcett said:  “the canine stomach can metabolise onions, that isn’t the issue. The issue is one of toxicity.”","http://archive.is/rRfQG,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/influenza-pandemic,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/bacterial-vs-viral-infection ,https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/emma-beckett,https://www.hoax-slayer.net/flu-remedy-myth-onions-absorb-viruses-bacteria-room/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-onions-vs-flu/,https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-you-asked/it-true-onions-can-absorb-bacteria,https://www.aap.com.au/onions-dont-become-highly-poisonous-if-cut-the-day-before-cooking,https://daa.asn.au/voice-of-daa/daa-spokespeople/,https://daa.asn.au/about-daa/,http://www.onionsaustralia.org.au/about-oa/,http://www.onionsaustralia.org.au/about-the-industry/facts-and-info/,https://animalpoisons.com.au/meet-the-team/,https://sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/anne-fawcett.html",Onion fears and fables overcooked but still beware for the dog,,,,,,

The company’s name is written as two words, not “Ripcurl” as appears throughout the Instagram post.Rip Curl’s Australian Instagram account also shows the name as two words.The “ripcurl_models” Instagram account made its first post on December 21, 2019, with the image of the official Rip Curl logo and no caption. The post for the supposed model call out was posted on December, 29, 2019.Rip Curl Media and Communications Manager, Mimi LaMontagne, told AAP FactCheck that the “@ripcurl_models” Instagram account and its call for models are not genuine.Ms LaMontagne said the company does not conduct model searches on Instagram or any other social media platform and the Rip Curl Group “is in no way associated with the Instagram account“.                                      Rip Curl is the sponsor of the Rip Curl Pro held at Bells Beach, Victoria. “Rip Curl became aware of the @ripcurl_models Instagram account on January 8, 2020, and a ticket was immediately lodged with Instagram flagging its inauthenticity asking for the account to be removed from the platform,” Ms LaMontagne told AAP FactCheck.A series of other Instagram accounts impersonating major brands and following a similar recruitment drive strategy have popped up on the social media platform in the past. Men’s fashion website HYPEBEAST reported a similar fake Nike account using the same recruitment tactic.

Talk to your local florist. Find out what flowers can you order that will help Australian farms rebuild and replenish”.The post has been shared more than 39,000 times and seen by more than 200,000 people. It has attracted more than 2,400 reactions and 700 comments. A Facebook post claims that Australian rose farms have been damaged by bushfires. The AnalysisMajor bushfires have been burning around Australia since September 2019, scorching millions of hectares along the east coast of Australia and claiming more than 30 lives.Fires affected large coastal and inland areas in Victoria, NSW and southern Queensland.A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesman told AAP FactCheck in an email that the department was “not aware of any commercial rose growers impacted by the recent bushfires” and it did not expect “a significant increase in rose imports this year compared to previous years”. Victoria is a major source of Australian-grown fresh-cut flowers, accounting for 30 per cent of the nation’s cut flower production.Bushfires have burned through the Gippsland region in the east of the state but Victorian Farmers Federation Vice President Emma Germano said no Flowers Victoria members had been affected by the fires.“To the best of our knowledge, no (Victorian) commercial rose growers have been impacted,” she said in an email to AAP FactCheck.Ms Germano told AAP FactCheck the majority of roses currently available in Australia are imported from overseas.Flowers Victoria is a branch of the Horticulture Group of the Victorian Farmers Federation and is a lobby group for flower growers and farmers in Victoria.Shane Holborn, the former executive officer of now-defunct industry body Flowers Australia, told AAP FactCheck that most Valentine’s Day roses sold in Australia are not grown locally, with Kenya and Colombia the two largest supplier countries.“About 80 per cent of roses sold in Australia for Valentine’s Day are imported,” he said. About 80% of roses sold in Australia for Valentine’s Day are imported, an ex-industry head says. Mr Holborn said a majority of Australian rose growers had gone out of business over the past 10 years as imported flowers have become cheaper.He said most of the rose growers would be clustered near cities and towns.“I would be surprised if more than a handful have been affected (by bushfires),” he said.“I know that some flower growers have been affected but it would be more the native ones out in regional areas.”Delwyn Thomas, a horticulturalist and co-author of a professional flower guide produced by Australia’s Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, said she had not heard of rose growers being affected by bushfires. “I’ve spoken to some rose growers of late and their biggest concern was about the drought,” Ms Thomas said.Ms Thomas said local rose growers had begun importing roses to counter the cost of heating and cooling greenhouses out of season but the import trade has grown “bigger and bigger” over the past decade.","http://archive.is/VHQwQ,https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/australia-suffers-devastating-fires-after-hottest-driest-year-record,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/bushfires-death-toll-rises-to-33-after-body-found-in-burnt-out-house-near-moruya,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043,https://www.agriculture.gov.au/,https://twitter.com/itsnotfairman/status/1212511098764554241,http://www.vff.org.au/vff/The_VFF/Board_of_Directors/vff/About_Us/Profiles.aspx?hkey=ade72ab8-85f4-4c59-8572-e8cc5827c671,http://flowersvic.com.au/about/what-we-do/,https://www.agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/13-079.pdf",Aussie-grown roses are rare on Valentine’s Day but it’s not because of the bushfires,,,,,,

A red circle highlights the product’s ‘Risk’ list which includes: “May cause sensitisation by skin contact”, “may cause cancer”, and “toxic to aquatic organisms”.The post’s caption reads, “For those of you who eat hot cross buns, bakers use a capful of bunspice essence per 25kg of dough to make them, have a look at the warning on the first picture. Know what’s in the food you eat and buy for your family …. and we wonder why the rates of cancer and auto immune (sic) disease are ever increasing! 🤒🤮 #WholeFoods #PlantBased #MayCauseCancer 🤬.”The post has been viewed more than 650,000 times and attracted more than 25,000 shares, 4,300 comments and 2,600 reactions. A Facebook post shows a warning circled on a bottle labelled Bunspice Essence. The AnalysisA similar post about hot cross bun ingredients, featuring the same image, has circulated on Facebook since at least March 2016.University of New South Wales food safety expert Julian Cox told AAP FactCheck the post takes the safety warnings out of context because they apply to the contents of the bottle rather than an amount used in a food product.“The first part says it contains greater than 60 per cent ethyl alcohol, so basically normal ethanol,” Associate Professor Cox said.“Even ethanol itself consumed directly in high amounts, as we know, can be toxic.“If you were to drink that bunspice essence directly from the bottle, the ethanol itself could create acute or chronic health effects.”“The point is the labelling on that is intended to represent safety warnings and risk around the products in that bottle, not about its end use.”Associate Professor Cox told AAP FactCheck a person would have to eat “hundreds of hot cross buns” made with the bun spice essence in one sitting to actually see a toxic effect.A spokesperson for IXOM, the parent organisation of the Keith Harris company which produces the bunspice essence, told AAP FactCheck the warning on the label related to the use of cinnamon oil in the bun spice essence and drinking the product straight or consuming it in copious quantities.“One of the spices used in bun spice is cinnamon oil … which is naturally occurring, however levels are monitored due to a component it naturally contains,” the spokesperson said.“For this reason, any ingredients using a certain amount of cinnamon oil needs a health warning. It’s Australian law and food regulations.”According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, cinnamon contains safrole, a substance that is “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” based on the results of animal studies.The department also states it found no studies linking “human cancer and exposure specifically to safrole”.The IXOM spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the “May cause cancer’ warning on the label was required by Safe Work Australia due to the presence of safrole, which the regulatory body lists as a hazardous chemical.IXOM’s spokesperson said the bunspice essence formulation was changed in 2016, reducing the cinnamon oil to a low level that does not require a warning. The label on the bottle in the Facebook post states the date of manufacture as January 13, 2015.The spokesperson said a kilogram of hot cross buns would contain about half a millilitre of cinnamon oil.“You would need to eat tonnes of hot cross buns on a regular basis for any ill effects.” A person would need to eat tonnes of hot cross buns regularly for any ill effects, say experts. Cinnamon, especially Cassia cinnamon, also contains a compound called coumarin which, if consumed in large amounts, might cause or worsen liver disease, according to the US National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).The NCCIH said in most cases, cassia cinnamon doesn’t have enough coumarin to make people sick.Supermarkets Coles and ALDI responded to customers’ questions in 2016 saying their hot cross buns did not include bunspice essence 33 HC4309 as an ingredient.Brumby’s Bakery and a Baker’s Delight franchise in Ulladulla, NSW confirmed they did use bunspice essence in their hot cross buns.Brumby’s stated they do use a small amount of essence but said “the essence we use contains no ingredients identified as carcinogenic”.Baker’s Delight Ulladulla said they use a small amount of bunspice essence in their bun wash mix as a flavour enhancer.“Bakers Delight Holdings are committed to food safety and as such maintain a strict Approved Supplier Program. All ingredients must comply with the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) Food Standards Code,” the company said in its March, 2016 response to a question on Facebook.In 2019, ABC News covered a similar claim in a news article and found it to be misleading.","http://archive.is/Amyex,http://archive.today/We3hG,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-julian-cox,https://www.ixom.com/about-us/brands,https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/profiles/safrole.pdf,http://hcis.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/HazardousChemical/Details?chemicalID=4099,https://nccih.nih.gov/health/cinnamon,https://twitter.com/coles/status/714274456319885312,https://www.facebook.com/ALDI.Australia/posts/can-you-confirm-that-the-following-toxic-flammable-cancer-causing-ingredient-is-/1117981688259331/,https://www.facebook.com/brumbys/posts/do-you-use-bunspice-essence-in-your-hot-cross-buns/10154204916321996/,https://www.facebook.com/BakersDelightUlladulla/posts/hi-just-wondering-do-you-use-bunspice-essence-33-hc4309/1100378410012628/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/expert-says-bunspice-facebook-post-is-misleading/10739638  ",Hot cross buns spice essence “warning” to be taken with a grain of salt,,,,,,

It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses which also the SARS and MERS respiratory infections. Coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and humans.According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) coronavirus update on February 5, 2020, there have been 24,554 confirmed cases globally and 492 deaths (491 in China and one outside of China).The Ebola virus, transmitted from wild animals to people, was first discovered in 1976 with the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, the largest and most complex, according to WHO. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex, according to WHO. The US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), put the global Ebola death toll for 2014-2016 outbreak at 11,325.Fatalities for The Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an outbreak declared in August, 2018 has become the second largest Ebola outbreak on record, also outstrips the death toll for 2019 novel coronavirus. There have been 2,246 deaths in the DRC as of February 2, 2020, according to WHO figures citing the African nation’s health ministry as its source.For HIV/AIDS, the WHO reports there have been 32 million people die since the beginning of the epidemic. The US government website, HIV.gov, lists 1981 as the year the first cases were reported.The European Centre for Disease Control says that the 2019 coronavirus is as transmissible as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which caused 8,000 cases in the 2002-03 outbreak, but that “preliminary findings indicate that it is less fatal”.Regarding the post’s photo, AAP FactCheck conducted a reverse image search and found it was taken for the news agency Reuters in March 2014. The picture shows people taking part in an art project in Frankfurt, Germany in remembrance of victims of a World War II Nazi concentration camp. Reuters’ image description provides further details: “People lay down in a pedestrian zone as part of an art project in remembrance of the 528 victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp, in Frankfurt, March 24, 2014. The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945.

It reads, “As the disease is starting to spread in the greater Sydney region. I would like to warn wholesale shops and buyers on the risk of buying contaminated products.

It also states that train stations in these suburbs “have shown positive readings to the virus”.The post has been shared more than 950 times and generated more than 1700 comments.A Facebook post falsely claims coronavirus was found in foods and at Sydney locations. The AnalysisCoronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness with symptoms ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases including the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). They can be transmitted between animals and humans, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The coronavirus causing the current outbreak, temporarily named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first transmitted in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and officially confirmed as a new virus in January 2020.Regarding the post’s claims about the virus contaminating specific food and drink products, AAP FactCheck sought an opinion from viral infectious diseases expert Professor Damian Purcell, from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne.Prof Purcell told AAP FactCheck in an email that there was “no current or historical evidence of food being a source of any coronavirus transmission”.“The coronaviruses are relatively fragile (like HIV) and need close proximity between the donor and the recipient to avoid drying out and losing their infectivity. This is the same as other similarly fragile viruses that have a lipid envelope on their outer surface, like HIV, which is not transmitted by food, or by a toilet seat.“Coronaviruses are not able to spread through foodstuffs or air that is at a distance from an infected person.”Regarding the origin of the post and its information about cases in Sydney, a NSW Health spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email: “This post has not originated from NSW Health or any entity relating to us.“Further there is no such entity as the ‘Department of Diseasology Parramatta’.”AAP FactCheck also found similar posts claiming different Sydney suburbs listed including Cabramatta, Burwood, Newtown and Guildford.“NSW Health would like to assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no risk to visitors, and there have been no ‘positive readings’ at train stations,” the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.An infectious disease expert says there is no evidence of food as a coronavirus transmission source.","https://archive.is/bBTNO,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-damian-purcell,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.nsw.gov.au%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEah_SUnH3X_BOfHflD4qw9ZSbjYA,https://archive.is/FIBki/image","Post makes false claims about coronavirus in foods, at train stations",,,,,,

The post continues: “As a result of this the Greens gained the balance of power and signed the Native Forest Protection Act, which defunded National Park Rangers and Control Burn Programs”.The text appears above a photo of Ms Gillard and Mr Brown each signing a document, with then-treasurer Wayne Swan and Greens MPs Rachel Siewert, Christine Milne, Sarah Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt standing behind them.The post has been viewed more than 20,000 times and has been shared more than 170 times. A Facebook post claims Bob Brown “allowed Prime Minister Julia Gillard to form government”. The AnalysisThe first claim in the post is that “in 2010 Bob Brown led the Australian Greens with the ALP, which allowed Prime Minister Julia Gillard to form government.”In 2010 Labor leader Ms Gillard formed a minority government with the support of three independent MPs – Andrew Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor – along with Greens MP Adam Bandt. The minority government came after a closely contested federal election sparked by the removal of Kevin Rudd as prime minister.The post then goes on to say, “As a result of this the Greens gained the balance of power and signed the Native Forest Protection Act, which defunded National Park Rangers and Control Burn Programs.”The first part of the claim states the Greens gained the balance of power as a result of forming government with the ALP, however a Parliamentary Library research paper states the party held the balance of power by having nine senators – not by forming a minority government with Labor.The research paper describes the Greens’ hold on the balance of power at the time as an “influential position” which allowed them to determine the outcome of votes in the Senate whenever the government and opposition were at odds. Minor parties and independents have held the balance of power from 1981-2005 and since 2008.The second part of the claim states the parties then “signed the Native Forest Protection Act”.The Federal Register of Legislation, which lists and tracks all Australian Government legislation and related documents, has no record of a Native Forest Protection Act. A search of the lists of acts that are in force, no longer in force or as made also makes no mention of the bill.Australian parliamentary online archives show that a bill called “Native Forest Protection Bill 1996” was introduced to the Senate in 1996 and was read by Mr Brown in the Senate that year.An explanatory memorandum tabled with the bill stated the purpose of the proposed law was to provide protection to native forests by prohibiting logging and the exportation of wood chips derived from native forests. But the bill, which was introduced to parliament in 1996, not 2010, did not become law as it was not passed by the parliament. The bill also did not propose cuts to national park rangers or controlled burn programs, which are not the responsibility of the federal government.The bill’s author, then newly-elected Tasmanian senator and Australian Greens leader Bob Brown, hoped the bill would “extend a mantle of protection over areas that have been identified by experts as having World Heritage values“.“This Bill aims to secure for the future the wonderful forests of this nation, from the South-West wilderness of Tasmania to the karri forests of Western Australia, and from East Gippsland up through the forests of New South Wales to Queensland,” Mr Brown told the Senate in September 1996.The photo used in the Facebook post is a September 1, 2010 image of Ms Gillard and Mr Brown signing the agreement that formalised Greens support for a minority Labor government. Gillard-led Labor did not secure the support of independents Oakeshott and Windsor, allowing it to form minority government, until September 7. Julia Gillard & Bob Brown signed an agreement under which the Greens supported a minority Labor government.","https://archive.is/jKz20,https:/archive.ph/QnsU0,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=83T,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1112/12rp08#_Toc318798332,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1112/12rp08#_Toc318798332,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByTitle/Acts/NoLongerInForce/Na/0/0/principal,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByTitle/Acts/Asmade/Na/0/0/all,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter10/Bills%E2%80%94the_parliamentary_process,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query%3DId%3A%22legislation%2Fbillhome%2Fs46%22;rec=0,https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/states-to-feel-federal-heat-over-hazard-reduction-burns-20200105-p53ozo.html,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2F1996-09-11%2F0021;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F1996-09-11%2F0021%22,https://photos.aap.com.au/search/(credit:AAPIMAGE%20or%20credit:%22aap%20video%22)/Latest%20AAP%20Coverage?q=%7B%22pageSize%22:25,%22pageNumber%22:2,%22SearchKeywords%22:%5B%7B%22Keyword%22:%22Julia%20Gillard,%20Bob%20Brown%22,%22Operator%22:%22AND%22%7D%5D%7D",Greens and Labor did not sign ‘Forest Protection Act’ cutting rangers,,,,,,

January 23, 2020.The AnalysisDeputy National Party leader Bridget McKenzie is under heavy pressure over her handing of a sports grants scheme that was found to have given money to clubs in marginal Coalition seats and electorates targeted by the Coalition government for the 2019 election.As Senator McKenzie resists calls to resign from the ministry, and the Prime Minister’s department investigates the sports grants affair, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has launched a strident defence of his cabinet colleague.Talking to 2GB radio host Ray Hadley on Thursday, January 23, Mr Dutton said it was “appropriate” that the PM’s office investigated and people should be reassured by that process.“But we’re not hanging people out to dry, we’re not listening to the Twitter crazies,” Mr Dutton said.“Bridget McKenzie made recommendations, as I understand it, on advice from the sporting body that these programs that have been funded were recommended.”Mr Dutton repeated his position on Nine’s Today Show on Friday morning, saying “There was no funding provided to a project that wasn’t recommended.” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has defended Senator Bridget McKenzie over a sports grant scandalAAP FactCheck examined the claim that Senator McKenzie approved funding for programs that were recommended by Sport Australia, the government agency responsible for administering the grants program.The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) looked into the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program (CSIG) following a request from shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus after a Liberal candidate for the 2019 federal election awarded a funding cheque to a local bowling club, rather than the sitting independent MP.The ANAO assessed the handling of the program, which handed out $100 million of taxpayer funds across 684 projects. The money was distributed over three rounds in December 2018, February 2019 and April 2019.Senator McKenzie, currently Minister for Agriculture, was the Minister for Sport at the time and was responsible for awarding the funding.In its report, published on January 15, 2020, the ANAO assessed the handling of each round of funding.For Round 1, the ANAO found that the applications recommended were chosen by the minister’s office rather than Sport Australia. The report concluded: “Ninety-one (41 per cent) of the approved projects were not on the list of 426 endorsed by the Sport Australia board.”For Round 2, the ANAO found Sport Australia “did not play a role in deciding which applications should be recommended”. Sport Australia had identified 204 applications to recommend to the minister’s office but did not provide them. The minister’s office told Sport Australia which applications would be approved. The report found: “One hundred and sixty-two (70 per cent) of the approved projects were not on the list of 204 applications Sport Australia planned to recommend.”For Round 3, the ANAO again found Sport Australia was not involved in deciding on recommendations. Sport Australia did identify 245 applications for recommendation but the minister’s office had already told the body which applications would be approved. The report stated: “One hundred and sixty-seven (73 per cent) of the approved projects had not been recommended by Sport Australia.”Among its findings, the ANAO said there was “evidence of distribution bias in the award of grant funding” and that the award of funding “was not consistent with the assessed merit of applications”.“The award of funding reflected the approach documented by the Minister’s Office of focusing on ‘marginal’ electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be ‘targeted’ by the Coalition at the 2019 Election,” the ANAO report said.The auditor’s report concluded that: “The successful applications were not those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines”.AAP FactCheck emailed Mr Dutton’s office on January 24 to ask what basis Mr Dutton had for saying Senator McKenzie made recommendations on advice from Sport Australia.In an emailed response, a spokesperson for Mr Dutton said: “The Minister doesn’t have anything further to add to what he has stated publicly.”Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck has found Mr Dutton’s statement that Senator McKenzie made recommendations on advice from Sport Australia does not reflect the findings of the ANAO report.","https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=207825,https://www.sportaus.gov.au/grants_and_funding/community_sport_infrastructure_grant_program,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/dutton-defends-embattled-mckenzie-amid-growing-speculation-over-her-future-20200123-p53u1p.html,https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-parliament-house-0,http://archive.ph/uZNtL,https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1220453323087798300,https://www.sportaus.gov.au/sportaus/about,https://www.anao.gov.au/,https://www.anao.gov.au/sites/default/files/hon-mark-dreyfus-qc-mp-correspondence-25-feb-2019.pdf,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-calls-in-auditor-over-sports-grant-presented-by-liberal-candidate-georgina-downer-20190224-p50zxz.html,https://www.anao.gov.au/work/performance-audit/award-funding-under-the-community-sport-infrastructure-program",Dutton’s McKenzie defence fails audit test,,,,,,

A new claim is that the potentially deadly infection is a “man-made” combination of parts of the HIV-1 virus and the SARS virus. A post on a Facebook page, Ross Walter Nutritionist & Naturopath, on February 3, 2020, claims a “Wuhan laboratory involved in experimenting with the SARS coronavirus” has created 2019-nCoV and that it “was either accidently [sic] or deliberately released”.The lengthy post refers to a paper published in 2020 as supporting the claim that “the new novel coronavirus is MAN-MADE”.An image attached to the post reads “Confirmed: the coronavirus was man-made! SARS + HIV = coronavirus”. The post has been viewed on Facebook more than 36,000 times, has been shared at least 350 times times and has attracted more than 200 reactions and 160 comments.  A Facebook post falsely claims research has confirmed that the 2019 coronavirus is a man-made combination of the SARS and HIV viruses. The AnalysisAfter emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, 2019, the novel coronavirus was officially confirmed as a new strain of coronavirus in January 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to serious infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The post on the Ross Walter Nutritionist & Naturopath Facebook page claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a biosafety laboratory in Wuhan province, “appear to have created this new coronavirus by playing with its genetics”. There have been numerous online claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is connected to the coronavirus outbreak. Those claims seem to be based on a January story on a US non-mainstream news site. However there is no evidence that suggests the 2019 novel coronavirus was made in a lab and the expert quoted in the story states: “there isn’t evidence or indication” of a virus escaping the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The Facebook post refers to a 2010 scientific study by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Australia’s CSIRO and the University of Minnesota Medical School in the United States. The study found bats “may be candidates as the natural host” of the SARS coronavirus. Medical staff help patients at a new field hospital in Wuhan, China, where early infections with the new coronavirus were linked to a seafood and animal market. The post states: “Remember in the early days of the new novel coronavirus, that it was suggested in the media that bats may have been involved!”.However the link between bats and viruses, including coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS, has been documented before and since the 2010 study.A 2013 study published by The Royal Society, the United Kingdom’s national science academy, found bats host more than 61 viruses infectious to humans. A 2006 American Society for Microbiology study stated “the virus responsible for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this group of bat-associated viruses”. The “2002 to 2003 outbreak” refers to SARS, which affected 26 countries in that period.And a January 2019 paper also examined how bats are able to harbour many types of coronavirus.The post then refers to a paper published on January 31, 2020, on bioRxiv, a website that makes unpublished,unedited and non-peer-reviewed life sciences studies available.The study, which was withdrawn within days of being posted following criticism of its scientific research methods, claimed to have found four “insertions” of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – “which are unique to the 2019-nCoV” that all have “identity or similarity” to those found in two strains of the HIV-1 virus. University of New South Wales microbiology expert Professor Peter White described the study as “complete nonsense”.Prof White said the study’s analysis was flawed because the matches between the two viruses were just random matches of “very short sequences of the entire 10,000 long amino acid sequence of the 2019 novel coronavirus.”  “The first flaw is that they didn’t validate their method, and when sought to show HIV compares with the novel coronavirus, they got a positive result.  “Any other virus (of the more than many thousands we know exist) would have produced a similar result.”The post also says that the paper claimed the four HIV sequences in 2019-nCoV “would not be possible in nature,” and says “Hence the new novel coronavirus is MAN-MADE”.But the paper does not state that the sequences are “not possible”. In the abstract the authors state: “The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity / similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.”Asked if insertions meant human intervention, Prof White said it did not and that an “insertion” of a new segment “could easily happen by mutation in nature”. The withdrawn paper made no claim that the virus was man-made.The bioRxiv website has placed a warning on new coronavirus-related research papers stating that “these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed” and “should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice / health-related behaviour, or be reported in news media as established information”.","http://archive.is/nJ2KV,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus/en/,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/,https://www.facebook.com/rawnutritionist/photos/a.686493654798016/2632849873495708/?type=3&theater,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/no-evidence-2019-coronavirus-came-from-a-chinese-lab,http://archive.today/K9zlg,http://archive.today/xmOHE,http://archive.today/4Fpt5,https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/,http://archive.today/SAGdK,http://archive.is/5nl2K,https://www.biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv,https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-peter-andrew-white",The 2019 coronavirus is not a man-made combination of HIV and SARS viruses,,,,,,

The post has been shared more than 500 times and attracted more than 300 reactions and 30 comments.The AnalysisThe post’s claim that a volcanic eruption puts more carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the atmosphere than the amount generated by mankind over history echoes a similar post in December 2009 which claimed “Mt. Saint Helen’s volcano eruption put more toxic fumes, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide etc. into the atmosphere than all of the emissions from all of mankind’s pollution from day one to now.”AAP FactCheck found the earliest example of the Mount Etna post could be traced back to at least January 2016.AAP FactCheck examined a volcanoes-and-emissions claim in September 2019 regarding Bali’s Mount Agung and another from December 2019, which labelled efforts to reduce carbon emissions as pointless, claiming carbon emitted from volcanic eruptions had undone all human emissons reduction efforts.  Mt Etna, on Sicily’s east coast, is Europe’s most active volcano. The volcano Mount Etna lies on Sicily’s east coast and is about half a million years old. It is Europe’s most active volcano and is also a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site.Mount Etna has a long history of eruptions dating from July 2019 to the B.C period, according to the Smithsonian Institution and National Geographic. Etna’s most destructive incident occurred in 1669, when lava flowed for four months, killing 20,000 people and destroying the Italian city of Catania and several neighbouring villages.A  2011 paper from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) specifically addressed the question of carbon dioxide emissions from Earth’s volcanoes versus human activities.USGS scientist Dr Terry Gerlach wrote in the paper that: “The climate change debate has revived and reinforced the belief, widespread among climate skeptics, that volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities. In fact, present-day volcanoes emit relatively modest amounts of CO2, about as much annually as states like Florida, Michigan, and Ohio”.University of New South Wales physical meteorology and atmospheric climate dynamics expert Professor Steven Sherwood told AAP FactCheck in September 2019 that “on average over time, volcanoes emit about one per cent as much CO2 as humanity.”“Humanity emits enough CO2 to cover the entire Earth with a 2cm layer every year, way more than any volcano.  Since the ‘beginning of time’ humanity has emitted billions of cubic kilometers of CO2,” Professor Sherwood said.A similar conclusion was reached by the British Geological Survey in a paper titled ‘Volcanic Contributions to the Global Carbon Cycle‘, published in 2005.The British Geological Survey said, in the summary of the paper: “Present day geological emissions of CO2 include both volcanic emissions (both passive, from volcanoes in repose, and those related directly to eruptive activity) and non-volcanic – direct emissions from the Earth’s crust and lithosphere. The contribution to the present day atmospheric CO2 loading from volcanic emissions is, however, relatively insignificant, and it has been estimated that subaerial volcanism releases around 300 Mt/year CO2, equivalent to just 1% of anthropogenic emissions.”University of Queensland greenhouse gas emissions researcher Dr Alistair Grinham also told AAP FactCheck humans “contribute far more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than volcanoes.”“A recent estimate for the annual contribution from volcanoes is approximately 0.65 gigatonnes…whereas humans are currently contributing over 50 gigatonnes,” Dr Grinham wrote in an email.","https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/science-climate-change/9-what-does-science-say-about-climate-change-options,https://archive.is/GdstC/image,https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheGreensLittleBagofStupidity/about/?ref=page_internal,https://archive.is/n1eWK,https://tineye.com/search/ae1bffc4abc47dbc6a3bd4bfef83be0b99c22b9f?page=1,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/not-true-that-volcanoes-emit-more-greenhouse-gas-than-humans,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/iceland-philippines-volcanic-eruptions-didnt-produce-more-co2-than-humans,https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_57.html,https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1427/,https://www.dw.com/en/italys-etna-volcano-erupts-on-sicily-disrupting-flights/a-49668193,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/03/mount-etna-volcano-eruption-sicily/,https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mount-etna-erupts,https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/file_mngr/file-154/Gerlach-2011-EOS_AGU.pdf,https://www.usgs.gov/,https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/steven-sherwood,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1446,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bgs.ac.uk%2Fdownloads%2Fstart.cfm%3Fid%3D432&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFSIQOz_BzZm6C7dQzzAgD37HNYdA,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fresearchers.uq.edu.au%2Fresearcher%2F1446&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGk8fajUhQrm7t1NlMNKWlHS84d6w,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/",No carbon contest between emissions-heavy humans and volcanoes,,,,,,

This kills coronavirus how did they know about it in 2019 ??”The post has been viewed more than 150,000 times, shared more than 1,100 times and attracted more than 200 comments and 100 reactions.  A Facebook post asks how did cleaning products company Dettol know about the current coronavirus outbreak in 2019. The AnalysisThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified on December 31, 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and officially confirmed as a new virus in January 2020. The post questions how the term “coronavirus” was printed on the label of a Dettol cleaning product in 2019 before the Novel Coronavirus was detected. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which can cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). They are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between humans and animals. According to the US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s and are named for the “crown-like spikes on their surface”. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family. The CDC and Australia’s Smartraveller travel advice website has linked the initial human infections of this strain to animal-to-person exposure at a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. There are seven types of coronaviruses which can infect humans, including 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 which are common and other more severe human coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.  The 2019 Novel Coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family, according to the US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A spokesperson from Reckitt Benkiser (RB), the UK-based parent company of Dettol, in Australia told AAP FactCheck the image of the label featured in the post is not from an Australian Dettol product. At the bottom left on the Dettol product label, a partly obscured address reads “PO Box 4044 Slough SL1 ONS” and “Citywood Business Camp…” AAP FactCheck traced the address to a number of RB owned brand sites including Dettol UK. In response to the claim their products can kill “Human Coronavirus”, Dettol UK’s information page states the 2019 novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus “never seen before in humans” so is not yet available for testing with Dettol products. Dettol UK state specific products, including Dettol Surface Cleanser, have demonstrated effectiveness against certain strains from the same group of viruses as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. A spokesperson for RB told AAP FactCheck by email the reason the labels on many products mention Coronavirus is they are effective against other strains. “Whilst we are not yet in a position to test against the new strain, this point should be borne in mind when considering whether they are likely to be effective against the new strain,” the spokesperson said.","http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.is%2F29Drc&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF1o9PCE5qq84pVQmefp0FQ-mXZyQ,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Femergencies%2Fdiseases%2Fnovel-coronavirus-2019&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGDn8By2vWkc9OPndhOCNT7dtznog,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fhealth-topics%2Fcoronavirus&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHJSuAKt9AObSH2miR8fF-pCJG9xw,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Ftypes.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFa44_A6H2pvHckQ-Wltc-t9em2kQ,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-nCoV%2Fsummary.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEj718Npn_U9TfwscZoQH5ruNOo4w,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fnews-and-updates%2Fnovel-coronavirus-outbreak&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGGwt3l7th_XB4qIQXKryHbRG1ldA,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Ftypes.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFa44_A6H2pvHckQ-Wltc-t9em2kQ,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rb.com%2Fbrands%2Fdettol%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGLUFxazgU319Xwncc4LqMXZ1f7yw,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dettol.co.uk%2Fcontact-us%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFjCZTw7oKo4-20E7Y48xU1HOVZFQ,https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dettol.co.uk%2Fabout-us%2Funderstanding-coronavirus%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH7w3sfyMCHzBsptmtl94QPcIaHtw","Dettol effective against known strains, not 2019 Novel Coronavirus",,,,,,

The text is overlaid onto an image of an intravenous drip bottle hanging from a stand. The post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and has attracted more than 1700 likes and 100 comments. An Instagram post inflates infection and death numbers from the coronavirus outbreak and falsely claims the World Health Organisation has declared the disease “a plague”.The AnalysisThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses which also the SARS and MERS respiratory infections. Coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and humans.According to the WHO, plague is a specific infectious disease caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis. The bacteria is usually found in small mammals and their fleas and can be transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissue or inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.Professor Basil Donovan, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of NSW Faculty of Medicine, told AAP FactCheck the word “plague” could also mean a very large outbreak or an epidemic.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the 2019 coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency.“It’s not a formally defined term. The trouble with wordplay, it’s got an emotional overlay. It has no meaning in medicine,” Professor Donovan said. “It’s not a scientific term. It’s good for clickbait. It doesn’t add any meaning to anything.”On January 30, 2020, the WHO convened its Emergency Committee to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) over the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO signifies “an extraordinary event” that requires a coordinated international response.WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the main reason for the declaration is “not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries”.“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with this,” he said.The post also claims 340,000 people are infected and 75,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus in China. According to the latest WHO coronavirus update on February 3, 2020, there have been  17,391 confirmed cases globally with 17,238 confirmed cases in China.The WHO have also confirmed 361 deaths from the coronavirus outbreak within China and one death outside China, in the Philippines. The latest figures from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHC) reported at 3am (AEST) on February 4, 2020 that 20,438 cases had been confirmed in the country. (use English translation)According to the Wuhan Coronavirus Global Cases reporting tool created by Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the tally of confirmed cases on mainland China stood at 20,001 with 426 confirmed deaths as of 12pm (AEST) February 4, 2020. All three sources put the total tally for people infected in China well under the figure of 340,000 claimed in the Instagram post. The Instagram user who posted the January 31 post shared an identical image on January 29, 2020, with that post’s caption including the word, “Cap”. According to dictionary.com’s slang dictionary, “cap” comes from the slang expression “no cap” which means “no lie” or “for real” to “emphasise someone is not exaggerating about something hard to believe”. Urban Dictionary also defines “That’s cap” as a term used for when someone’s actions are “unexceptional” or “fake”.The original post appears to have been posted on a Twitter account.

I’LL SHOW THEM”. A Facebook post from January 15, 2020 claims 50 per cent of Australia’s bushfires are deliberately lit. The post’s caption claims: “There have been about 60,000 BUSHFIRES IN AUSTRALIA EACH YEAR for the past decade. About 50% have been deliberate, 35% accidental and only 6% “natural” (lightning strikes etc)”.The caption goes on to mention “an age of – polarisation, global terrorism, anarchism and chaos” and to claim that “it’s likely that some of the fires in Australia, Europe and Canada” were caused by “‘ideologically’, politically and environmentally motivated arsonists”.The post has been shared more than 240 times and has attracted more than 390 reactions.The AnalysisThe percentages used in the post align with a 2008 Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) paper, “Deliberately lit vegetation fires in Australia” by Dr Colleen Bryant. A response in comments on the post by the page author confirmed that this paper was the reference.A chart in Dr Bryant’s paper (Figure 1: ‘Known’ vegetation fire causes (percent)) uses data from the late 1990s to the early 2000s to show 13.3 per cent of known vegetation fires were caused by “incendiary” means (meaning there was a legal finding or physical evidence that the fire was deliberate), 36.2 per cent were “suspicious” and 35.2 per cent “accidental”. Adding the incendiary and suspicious fires would result in 49.5 per cent – in line with the “about 50%” that the post claims was deliberately lit. A fire researcher says there is a difference in classification of bushfires and vegetation fires. The AIC’s Dr Bryant recently made a statement on her bushfire research after US fact-checking organisation FactCheck.org contacted her regarding claims linking arson to the bushfire crisis.In the statement to FactCheck.org, Dr Bryant clarifies her paper does not document only “bushfires” but rather the broader category of “vegetation fires” (page 2).Dr Bryant responded to FactCheck.org after an article in The Australian newspaper on January 7 (since updated on January 15) quoted a researcher who said 50 per cent of bushfires were lit by arsonists and subsequently cited Dr Bryant’s work to support the claim.Dr Bryant said her 2008 paper and a 618-page supporting technical report focused on officially reported fire incidents involving vegetation fires that were attended by state and territory fire agencies.She said it was “critical to note” her report “is not a report on ‘bushfire arson’. It is a report  examining the causes of … fire incidents involving vegetation fires”. (page 2)Bushfires are fires in bush including forests, scrubs, woodland or grasslands, Dr Bryant said, while vegetation fires covered by the research involve “any fire that occurs within vegetation”.The 2008 technical report said vegetation fires “may be fires in suburban parkland, along roadsides, hedgefires, or fires on a football oval” and in her  2020 statement Dr Bryant said: “All bushfires are vegetation fires but few vegetation fires are bushfires”.The paper states there are 45,000 to 60,000 vegetation fires attended by fire services in Australia each year.Separately, not all “suspicious” fires covered in her research can be assumed to be deliberately lit cases of arson although Dr Bryant said there is “a reasonable probability”. Her report states that a “suspicious” classification indicates “the possibility that the fire has been deliberately set” (page 4).A ‘deliberate’ fire refers to a person starting a fire with the intent to cause harm or destruction or being reckless about the possibility, and can include illegal prescribed burning such as unauthorised hazard reduction burns, the report says. (page 3-5)Dr Bryant said her 2008 report did state that for vegetation fires where a cause is recorded  “50 per cent may be lit deliberately”. However it also stated that “some caution should be taken when considering these figures. Just over 40 per cent of vegetation fires across Australia do not have a cause assigned by the responding fire agency”.Referring to the recent and ongoing fires, Dr Bryant said the possible 50 per cent of vegetation fires statistic “is not, and should not be used as, an assessment  of the likely causes of Australia’s 2019‐2020 bushfires, as it is not an accurate reporting of what has occurred, and it is unlikely representative of the actual picture”.Regarding claims of arsonists being responsible for bushfires, AAP FactCheck has previously addressed a claim that 183 people were arrested for starting fires during the 2019/20 bushfire crisis – a claim that was circulated widely on social media and overseas news reports – and found it false.A report by the ABC on January 11 found about one percent of land burnt in NSW during the 2019/20 bushfire season was attributed to arson, while the figure for Victoria was less.The NSW Rural Fire Service’s Inspector Ben Shepherd was quoted as saying: “I can confidently say the majority of the larger fires that we have been dealing with have been as a result of fires coming out of remote areas as a result of dry lightning storms”.","http://archive.is/J9xUz,https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi350,http://archive.ph/IJPUa,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/setting-the-record-straight-on-climate-change-and-arson-in-australias-bushfires/,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/bushfires-firebugs-fuelling-crisis-asarson-arresttollhits183/news-story/52536dc9ca9bb87b7c76d36ed1acf53f,https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/tbp/downloads/tbp027.pdf,https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi350,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/are-arson-figures-on-social-media-a-bushfire-beat-up,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-11/australias-fires-reveal-arson-not-a-major-cause/11855022",Research does not say half of Australia’s bushfires are deliberately lit,,,,,,

Even reports that they have been observed exhibiting “shepherding behaviour”.The post has been shared more than 8,700 times, attracted more than 10,000 reactions and more than 1,400 comments.Similar or identical versions of claim have appeared in many posts, such as this one, this one and this one, on Facebook and Instagram. Social media posts mention wombats “shepherding” animals into their burrows to escape bushfires. The AnalysisBushfires have so far burned across more than 11 million hectares around Australia, resulting in the deaths of 28 people, the destruction of thousands of homes and the death of more than a billion animals, according to one estimate.Amid the carnage Facebook posts recounting stories of wombats exhibiting “shepherding behaviour” attracted a lot of attention.One of the early and high-trending posts was an Instagram post from Greenpeace NZ, the New Zealand arm of the global conservation organisation, on January 9. The post generated more than 9,800 likes.Greenpeace NZ subsequently amended their post, adding  “we shared this from a social media post from Australia, but it turns out it’s not true”The numerous posts about possible wombat shepherding resulted in wildlife experts addressing the claims and, unfortunately for wildlife lovers, finding that they did not stack up.Charles Sturt University animal ecologist Dale Nimmo wrote an article headlined: “Accidental heroes: How wombats really save other animals during bushfires” that appeared on The Conversation website on January 15 and was also distributed to media outlets.“Wombats do not heroically round up helpless animals during a bushfire and lead them to safety,” Associate Professor Nimmo wrote.“But wombats do help other animals in a different way – even if it’s not their intention.” Wombats are solitary creatures that can be “cantankerous”, an expert says. Dr Nimmo said that small animals are known to use wombat warrens – networks of interconnecting burrows – to shelter from bushfires.One study of the southern hairy-nosed wombat found a warren with 28 entrances and nearly 90 metres of tunnelsDr Nimmo said a 2015 study that placed camera traps outside 34 wombat burrows showed a surprising variety of animals – including rock wallabies, skinks, birds and Little Penguins – using southern hairy-nosed wombat burrows.Dr Nimmo said wombats don’t have a solitary burrow but rather multiple burrows in a home range, meaning that many can be vacant at one particular time and other species may not need to share burrows with wombats at all. It’s vacant real estate.Dr Nimmo said How a wombat reacts to an uninvited guest “is difficult to know and likely depends on who’s visiting”.University of Melbourne zoology students recorded a wombat, koala and rabbit exiting the same burrow during a field research project in 2018.University of Melbourne native mammal expert Dr Kath Handasyde said the wombat and koala would have almost certainly not encountered each other in the burrow and while wombats will use a number of different burrows, normally there will only be one occupant at any given time because wombats are solitary creatures.“Wombats can be a bit cantankerous. If the koala had encountered the wombat, it would probably have been chased out and wouldn’t have been anywhere near as relaxed as we can see in the photos,” Dr Handasyde told the University of Melbourne’s Pursuit news website.AAP FactCheck asked Greenpeace New Zealand where they acquired their wombat information and a Greenpeace spokesperson referred to a post that originated from a Facebook user in Oregon in the United States on January 8.That post is the earliest example of the wombat shepherding claim found by AAP FactCheck.“I doubt that is the origin of the story. I’m also not 100% sure it’s not entirely incorrect, but it’s certainly hard to verify,” a Greenpeace NZ spokesperson said.","https://www.facebook.com/wildaware/photos/a.890765054339148/2771064449642523/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158145607068243&set=a.10153906310113243&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/marchinmarchbluemountains2014/photos/a.610434499010303/2654534544600278/?type=3&theater,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7RUt65ngLy/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://au.news.yahoo.com/australias-catastrophic-bushfire-season-030717140--spt.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRmF1Lm5ld3MueWFob28uY29tJTJGYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1jYXRhc3Ryb3BoaWMtYnVzaGZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLTAzMDcxNzE0MC0tc3B0Lmh0bWwmc2E9RCZzbnR6PTEmdXNnPUFGUWpDTkhIUmJtM1QzZ2lIOXF2M0JhVzlnVzBVaDA5Znc&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMN0CF3PESNOiOhH7TkqnStXs2cJ8V_5i-z6oTSj3mrJIhCDg66ymlQw12_VOdo5FyooYSWWzVGY5P25UTXuE33hRdoOdD-s1Amg0_lky3fw23wBFGvwTzUMQJMD4ZC2ig9J71zTLc5v1P-IYgWmCkbiLI-HwY1853O7g_fApaQg,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-09/nsw-bushfires-kill-over-a-billion-animals-experts-say/11854836,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7GF5_Ep8dw/,https://theconversation.com/tales-of-wombat-heroes-have-gone-viral-unfortunately-theyre-not-true-129891,http://www.publish.csiro.au/am/am15052,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/a-wombat-a-koala-and-a-rabbit-in-a-burrow,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157858244296192&set=a.10151378103006192&type=3&theater",Did wombats shepherd other animals into their burrows during the bushfires?,,,,,,

The image features the claim “The Greens have modified their bushfire risk management policy” with an arrow pointing to the URL and search results listing the date. At the bottom the post asks why, questioning “Could it be because their old policy is being hammered right now?” The Australian ANTI-Greens are listed as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) on its Facebook page and the group’s manifesto reads, “The greens are socialists. Move to Venezuela greenies”. The post has attracted more than 180 shares and generated more than 200 reactions and 90 comments.  A Facebook post from January 1, 2020 claims the Greens changed their policy on back-burning in November 2019. The AnalysisThe Greens NSW’s Bushfire Risk Management web page addresses the issue of back-burning several times among its 15 principles. One principle states the party believes that “hazard reduction, including manual, mechanical and hazard reduction burning activities should be strategically planned to protect the community and vulnerable assets while minimising the adverse impacts of these activities on the environment”. The Greens also advocate that “strict controls are required to reduce the amount of rural burning that is not required for essential asset protection”. The Facebook post includes an image purporting to show the party’s Bushfire Risk Management page was changed on November 8, 2019. The Greens NSW’s Bushfire Risk Management web page addresses back-burning among its 15 principles.An accompanying comment reads: “For the twits that think the greens party have always believed in back burning. When the fires started in November 2019 they quickly changed thier (sic) policy. Like cowards”. AAP FactCheck conducted a search of the web page address using internet archiver Wayback Machine and the results showed there was no policy change published on the website in November 2019. The internet archiver – which takes regular snapshots of URLs to capture the content at that moment in time “to create an Internet library for researchers, historians, and scholars” – had seven web captures for the Greens webpage in question. The captures spanned March 22, 2019 to December 21, 2019. AAP FactCheck used the Wayback Machine’s tool for comparing the content in the web captures to show the Greens’ web page had no deletions and alterations to its Bushfire Risk Management section between March and December 2019. An IT and communications spokesman for the Greens NSW confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email that the party’s policy was not changed in November 2019, nor at any stage since May 2014.The Greens NSW spokesman said the November date captured in the screenshot was not the result of a change to the content on the policy page.“It’s not clear from the posted image what tool was used to generate the November 2019 date,” the spokesperson said. “One explanation for the date is that our website uses a content management system (CMS) and generates the HTML code for pages dynamically from content stored in a database. These generated pages are then stored in a cache to speed up future access. It seems likely that the date reported was derived from the date the CMS stored the page in the cache.”The spokesman said any changes to the policy would require a decision by the party’s State Delegates Council, comprised of representatives of the 63 local Greens groups around NSW. “This process has an extensive consultation phase and it would be effectively impossible to make a change to the policy in the timeframe claimed by (the Facebook group).”","https://archive.is/OnyKJ,https://greens.org.au/nsw/policies/bushfire-risk-management,https://www.facebook.com/pg/The-Australian-ANTI-Greens-158418580891970/about/?ref=page_internal,https://greens.org.au/nsw/policies/bushfire-risk-management,https://www.facebook.com/158418580891970/photos/a.1727193787347767/2790997197634082/?type=3&theater,https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004716091-Wayback-Machine-General-Information,https://web.archive.org/web/20191111004944/https://greens.org.au/nsw/policies/bushfire-risk-management,https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20190322185010/20191221023936/https://greens.org.au/nsw/policies/bushfire-risk-management",The burning truth about the Greens’ bushfire risk policy,,,,,,

Looking down towards the blue, smoke-filled Jamison Valley. Mount Solitary (Korowal) on the horizon is partly obscured by the large smoke cloud which is illuminated yellow by the late afternoon sun.” A mobile app for Getty Images shows the date of Andrew Merry’s Three Sisters photo as “8 May 2018”. However, there is no date listed on the photo in the Getty photo library. When contacted by phone to clarify date of the image, Mr Merry told AAP FactCheck it was not from 2019.“If they’re saying that photo is from this year – it’s not,” Mr Merry said of the post when spoken to on December 20, 2019.Mr Merry directed AAP FactCheck to Getty’s mobile phone app to confirm the date. In this format, the photo is displayed with the date on which it was taken as “8 May 2018”.One of Mr Merry’s other photos, captured on the same day and showing tourists looking at the fire, puts the blaze into context as part of a “3500-hectare hazard reduction burn at Mt Solitary (Korowal)” carried out by the NSW Rural Fire Service and NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Rural Fire Service (RFS) website confirms May 8, 2018 as the date of the hazard reduction burn. The burn was widely reported by media outlets as the first conducted in the area since 1955. An article on the website Climate 2020, a United Nations Association-UK publication, also features the Getty photo by Mr Merry. The piece was published on November 9, 2018, more than a year before the time claimed in the Facebook post’s caption.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156616247186129&set=a.10151675975916129&type=3&theater,https://www.bluemts.com.au/info/thingstodo/threesisters/,http://archive.ph/c2Ojp,http://archive.today/TDGu7,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/,http://archive.today/Vqhr9,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/three-sisters-and-large-smoke-cloud-bushfire-forest-royalty-free-image/1027447110,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/three-sisters-and-large-smoke-cloud-bushfire-forest-royalty-free-image/1027447126,https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/tourists-at-the-echo-point-viewing-platform-royalty-free-image/1027447040?adppopup=true,http://archive.today/b6RDf,http://archive.ph/8eWEP,http://archive.ph/XOkxT,http://archive.ph/CMQ3i,http://archive.ph/toTW3",Burning Three Sisters photo is not from 2019 NSW bushfires,,,,,,

No Islamic Terrorism”. The post has been shared more than 600 times and attracted more than 40 reactions. A Facebook post highlights a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on terror attacks and compares it with Tokyo.The AnalysisThe genesis of the Facebook post dates back to September 18, 2016 when London Mayor Sadiq Khan was quoted by London’s Evening Standard in response to an explosion in New York that injured 29 people. In a video for a story headlined, “New York explosion: Sadiq Khan says terror attacks are ‘part and parcel of life in a big city’”, Mr Khan said: “Part and parcel of living in a great global city is you’ve got to be prepared for these things, you’ve got to be vigilant, you’ve got to support the police doing an incredibly hard job, you got to support the security services.” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo labelled the Chelsea district blast “an act of terrorism”. London Mayor Sadiq Khan was quoted in response to an explosion in New York that injured 29 people in 2016. A paraphrased version of Mr Khan’s quote was published by The Independent on September 22, 2016. The story’s opening two paragraphs read: “Sadiq Khan has said he believes the threat of terror attacks are “part and parcel of living in a big city” and encouraged Londoners to be vigilant to combat dangers. “The Mayor of London revealed he had a “sleepless night” after the recent bombing in New York, and said major cities around the world “have got to be prepared for these sorts of things” to happen when people least expect them.” On March 22, 2017, Mr Khan’s quote was tweeted by Donald Trump Jr with the comment: “You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city (sic), says London Mayor Sadiq Khan”. Many publications, including Time magazine, labelled Trump Jr’s comments as “misleading”. Time said Mr Khan “did not imply that terrorism is a part of everyday life in big cities – he said that preparedness is “part and parcel of living in a big city’.”Mr Khan’s quote gained another airing on ABC TV’s Q&A program in March 2017. The ABC was criticised for not correcting a question which was: “In the wake of the London terror attack in Westminster, the mayor of London, Mr Sadiq Khan, stated that terror attacks are now ‘part and parcel’ of living in a big city, expressing a need to be vigilant. Sydney is a booming metropolitan capital, with a population of 5 million Australians with diverse backgrounds and cultures. Is Mr Khan right? And do Sydneysiders and residents of other major Australian cities need to accept terrorism as an inevitable part of modern life?”The post’s claim that Tokyo is “the biggest city in the world” was supported by a United Nations publication titled, ‘2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects’ but the population figure of 13.6 million was not. Under a subheading ‘Cities ranking and mega cities’, the UN publication says: “Tokyo is the world’s largest city with an agglomeration of 37 million inhabitants, followed by New Delhi with 29 million, Shanghai with 26 million, and Mexico City and São Paulo, each with around 22 million inhabitants … By 2020, Tokyo’s population is projected to begin to decline, while Delhi is projected to continue growing and to become the most populous city in the world around 2028.” Population Stat, using World Bank, United Nations, Census and GeoNames data, lists Tokyo’s population in the urban area at 37.4 million and for the city area 8.3 million as of July 9, 2019.The post’s final claim, that there is “No Islamic Terrorism” in Tokyo checks out. AAP FactCheck was unable to evidence of an Islamic terror attack in Tokyo.  The Global Terrorism Database lists 403 terror incidents for Japan from 1970 to 2018. Under the column “Perpetrator Group” there are no listings for Islamic terrorists for incidents in Tokyo. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) documents more than 190,000 international and domestic terrorist attacks that occurred worldwide since 1970. The database is part of the US-based National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism which is headquartered at the University of Maryland.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10221406697423025&set=a.10210970246638278&type=3&theater,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/new-york-explosion-sadiq-khan-says-terror-attacks-are-part-and-parcel-of-life-in-a-big-city-a3347891.html,https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/sadiq-khan,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/new-york-city-explosion-manhattan-blast-that-injured-29-was-an-act-of-terrorism-a3347876.html,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-terrorism-attacks-part-and-parcel-major-cities-new-york-bombing-a7322846.html,https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/844594059679334400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E844594059679334400&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4710166%2Fdonald-trump-jr-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-terror-attack-parliament%2F,https://time.com/4710166/enums/,http://archive.ph/rU0ky,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/29/misleading-qa-question-on-sadiq-khan-should-have-been-corrected-abc-admits,https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html,https://populationstat.com/japan/tokyo,http://apps.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?page=5&casualties_type=&casualties_max=&country=101&count=100&expanded=yes&charttype=line&chart=overtime&ob=GTDID&od=desc#results-table,https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/,https://www.start.umd.edu/about/about-start,https://umd.edu/",What London’s mayor really said about terror attacks and big cities,,,,,,

The company, a subsidiary of US corporation JR Simplot, cited poor financial returns, high domestic manufacturing costs, cheaper imported alternatives and the high Australian dollar.“The frozen and canned vegetable categories have been chronic profit under-performers for years,” managing director Terry O’Brien said in the June 2013 statement.Against the backdrop of the 2013 federal election, the announcement generated media coverage including a report from ABC rural affairs show Landline.The September 14, 2013 program was the inspiration for the original Facebook post, with the earliest example AAP FactCheck could find – a post with a longer version of the text – published less than a week later.Copies of the text have continued to circulate online over the past six years, resurfacing in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.Simplot Australia is the last remaining local processor manufacturing frozen vegetables from Australian-grown produce.The post gained momentum again in December 2019, prompting the ABC’s Landline program to issue a “Hoax Alert” on Facebook to address the “unverified information”.“It appears to be in relation to a story we did on Australia’s frozen vegetable industry back in 2013,” Landline wrote in a December 18 post about the viral Facebook post in question.“Landline has NOT done a recent story on this issue and the claims made in the post are not current or verified. Landline and the ABC does NOT endorse any company or producer.”“If you see this post, please disregard it.”When approached by AAP FactCheck, Simplot Australia confirmed there is “no factual basis” for the Facebook claim that they are not far from closing.“Simplot Australia is committed to its Australian-based vegetable processing facilities,” the company told AAP FactCheck in an emailed statement on December 19.At the time of Simplot’s struggles in 2013, the origin of New Zealand frozen vegetables exported to Australia was a contentious issue.Vegetable industry group AUSVEG claimed in February, 2013 that “loopholes” allowed Chinese produce to be packaged or modified in New Zealand and then exported to Australia under the “deceptive” label of ‘Made in New Zealand from local and imported ingredients’.Horticulture New Zealand chief executive Peter Silcock told Stuff.co.nz the allegation was “ridiculous” and “protectionist scare-mongering”.But he acknowledged the practice of exporting Chinese products from New Zealand was “entirely legal”.Simplot rival McCain moved its production to New Zealand in 2010, while Heinz announced 300 job cuts across three Australian sites in 2011 as it shifted more work to its Hastings, New Zealand plant.Simplot’s Mr O’Brien told Landline in 2013 costs were “30 to 40 per cent higher” in Australia compared with New Zealand (4:20) and that New Zealand was “the main competitor for us in the vegetable business”.He later revealed in 2015 he was considering moving the business across the Tasman.But within five months of the initial announcement that cast doubt on the company’s long-term viability in Australia, Simplot Australia committed to retaining its regional vegetable operations.“In 2013 a number of Simplot’s processing facilities in regional NSW and Tasmania were under review as a result of growing pressures in the food processing and manufacturing sector,” Simplot said in its statement to AAP FaceCheck.“At the time Simplot was able to work with its key stakeholders and its parent company, US based JR Simplot, to support efficiency upgrades at the plants to help underpin their competitiveness.”In 2014, Simplot Australia signed a five-year deal with supermarket giant Coles to supply Australian-grown vegetables for their store brand frozen vegetable and potato products.That arrangement was expanded in 2016 as Coles turned to Simplot Australia to source an additional six million kilograms of Australian-grown vegetables to replace overseas stocks.Simplot Australia recorded a $62.3 million profit for its US parent company in 2018 and in April 2019 announced a $51.3 million investment to expand its potato processing plant in Ulverstone, Tasmania.","https://www.facebook.com/Astroboy2001/posts/10220018406751241,https://www.simplot.com.au/our-brands,http://archive.today/mUh9k,https://www.simplot.com/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2013-06-05/simplot-threatens-closures/4734746?,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-14/where-to-now/4958468,https://www.facebook.com/milton.block.3/posts/10201390805906526,https://www.facebook.com/Publicspaceswa/posts/buy-birdseye-and-edgell-the-only-australian-manufacturer-of-frozen-australian-gr/429624767170967/,https://www.facebook.com/driangawler/posts/if-you-do-need-to-buy-frozen-veggies-home-gardens-rulebuy-only-birdseye-and-edge/572817929487358/,https://www.facebook.com/coles/posts/did-you-see-landline-on-the-abcbuy-only-birdseye-and-edgell-this-was-shown-on-th/1166628040067876/,https://www.facebook.com/NguyenQuynhChau/posts/1574839432581564,https://www.facebook.com/TheSeasonalGardenCafe/posts/did-you-see-landline-on-the-abcbuy-only-birdseye-and-edgell-this-was-shown-on-th/1049880775163182/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/awokenaustralians/permalink/486453121962954/,https://www.facebook.com/maggie.boyd.56/posts/10216755962345514,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=634862280615663&id=195766187858610,https://www.facebook.com/LandlineABC/photos/a.655982667795317/2752090354851194/?type=3&theater,http://archive.today/Ky0RP,http://archive.today/Ky0RP,http://archive.today/TEeTI,http://archive.is/D8NwW,http://archive.today/UPnH2,https://ab.co/2PwnnCb,https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/wages-accord-sees-food-manufacturer-simplot-can-nz-move-20150113-12msiv,https://www.simplot.com.au/news/press-releases/simplot-australia-retains-its-australian-vegetable-operations/,http://archive.today/O86ju,http://archive.is/xykVk,http://archive.is/KFJcm",Is Australia’s last frozen vegetable company close to closing?,,,,,,
268,,,,False,,2019-12-19,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/quote-on-voting-doesnt-tally-as-mark-twain/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementIn the aftermath of the United Kingdom’s election some disillusioned voters have sought solace with a purported quote by US author and humourist Mark Twain. The December 13, 2019 post by UK-based Facebook page North Coast Cars features an image of Twain and a quote which reads, “If voting made any difference, they wouldn’t let us do it.” The post, shared by Australian users, has attracted more than 130 shares and 80 reactions.Some Facebook users have sought solace in a quote attributed to Mark Twain following the UK election result. The AnalysisTwain, who was born Samuel Clemens, is regarded as one of America’s greatest writers and is best known for the novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)  and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) based on the adventures of young boys on the Mississippi River. AAP FactCheck has previously investigated several quotes misattributed to Twain, including quotes about kindness and evidence.Dr Matthew Seybold, assistant professor of American Literature and Mark Twain Studies from New York’s Elmira College, told AAP FactCheck the quote didn’t correspond with Twain’s general respect for democratic elections.“He was cynical about representative government, sure, and about the intelligence of the electorate, and about the influence of moneyed interests in buying elections. He was pretty sure democracy would eventually be rolled back in the United States and elsewhere,” Dr Seybold said.  Mark Twain is best known for the novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. “But that wasn’t because he thought elections were ineffectual. He was a consistent advocate for voting rights, including suffrage for women.”Twain wrote about voting, including the power of the people and women’s suffrage, but the quote on voting being rigged does not appear in www.twainquotes.com, a site which aggregates the author’s maxims, quotations and various opinions.Barbara Schmidt, a researcher, writer and consultant for Mark Twain related projects and also www.twainquotes.com owner, told AAP FactCheck the quote does not appear in “any of Mark Twain’s known works”. The quote also does not appear in an archive of Mark Twain writings by the University of Virginia or an online archive of his letters by the Mark Twain Project. A spokesperson for Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, Connecticut told AAP FactCheck in an email that “as with so many quotes attributed to Twain, this isn’t his”. The quote has also been previously attributed to anarchist, feminist and political writer Emma Goldman. US fact checkers, Snopes and CheckYourFact have investigated the Twain-attributed quote and traced its possible origin to a 1976 newspaper column by Robert S. Borden in The Lowell Sun. Borden, writing about the US electoral system, said: “Has it ever dawned on the editors that the attitudes of the 70 million projected non-voters may be very consistent with the reality that the concept of voting and electing representatives is basically dishonest and fraudulent. If voting could change anything it would be made illegal!”","https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Twain,https://www.facebook.com/northcoastcarsdornoch/photos/a.652292488455067/1026905167660462/?type=3&theater,https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/biography/,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/kindness-quote-is-not-by-mark-twain,https://factcheck.aap.com.au/social-media-claims/mark-twain-evidence-quote-is-false,https://www.elmira.edu/academics/programs/faculty/humanities.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/Vote.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/index.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/twain3d.html,http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/index2.html,https://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/search?category=letters;rmode=landing_letters;style=mtp,https://marktwainhouse.org/about/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emma-Goldman,https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/emma_goldman_107325,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mark-twain-voting-quote/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/16/fact-check-mark-twain-voting-difference-illegal/,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5211342/if_voting_could_change_anything_it/",Quote on voting doesn’t tally as Mark Twain,,,,,,

The post’s text reads: “Population of Australia 1984 15.5 million“Population of Australia 2018 25 million “AND WE WONDER WHY WE HAVE NO WATER”.The post has been shared more than 5900 times and attracted more than 60 reactions and 60 comments.A December 14, 2019 post claims it has been 35 years since a dam was last built in Australia.The AnalysisAccording to the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD), Australia has more than 500 large dams, with 136 of those completed between 1985 and 2011. On a state-by-state basis, 14 dams were built in NSW during that period, two in Victoria, four in South Australia, 45 in Queensland, 40 in Tasmania, 23 in Western Australia, one in the Northern Territory and seven in the ACT.ANCOLD is an Australian-based voluntary association created in 1937 to advance dams capability and knowledge in Australia. It is also a member of the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD). ANCOLD’s dams register shows Wyaralong Dam in southeast Queensland as the last completed new build in 2011.Cotter Dam, in the Australian Capital Territory, submerged by heavy water flows during construction work in 2012.Cotter Dam in the ACT was listed as “enlarged” by ANCOLD in 2012. The Cotter Dam expansion, completed in 2013, involved the construction of a new 83 metre-high wall 125 metres downstream from an original dam which had been built in 1915 and undergone a number of enlargements itself.Further evidence of dam building since 1984 came from federal Water Resources Minister David Littleproud in a September 17, 2019 radio interview.Radio 3AW announcer Neil Mitchell quoted from Mr Littleproud’s September 16 media release, which said that since 2003, 20 dams had been completed in Australia – 16 of them in Tasmania, two in New South Wales, one in Queensland and one in the ACT. Responding to a question on whether Australia needs to build dams, Mr Littleproud said the states had failed to match water storage with population growth since 2003 and that, at the current rate, water storage per person will fall by more than 30 per cent by 2030.The minister was also reported by The Land newspaper as saying the past 19 years showed that of the 20 dams completed in Australia since 2003, 16 were in Tasmania.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=134343968010436&set=a.106148930829940&type=3&theater,https://www.ancold.org.au/?page_id=24,https://www.ancold.org.au/?page_id=3469,https://www.icold-cigb.org/GB/icold/member_countries.asp?ID=7,https://www.seqwater.com.au/dams/wyaralong,https://www.iconwater.com.au/cotterdam,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=265585,https://minister.agriculture.gov.au/littleproud/speeches-and-transcripts/radio-interview-3aw-neil-mitchell,http://archive.today/n9eee,https://www.theland.com.au/story/6389439/states-need-to-build-more-dams-minister/",This is how many dams have really been built in Australia since 1984,,,,,,

Pinatubo volcanic eruption in the Philippines “emitted more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth”. Accompanied by an image of the 2010 Icelandic volcano eruption, the post also claims there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet “spewing out” volcanic ash every single day and that the planet had “COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century”. The post has been shared more than 390 times and has attracted more than 130 comments and 180 reactions. A Facebook post from December 13, 2019 claims carbon emitted from volcanic eruptions have undone all human reduction strategies.The AnalysisThe world witnessed the second largest volcanic eruption in a century when Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in June 1991, according to the US Geological Survey. The eruption spewed magma and ash into the air and produced flows of gas and hot ash down the mountain side, forcing more than 15,000 people to be evacuated. The Facebook post refers to Professor Ian Plimer and “his book” regarding volcanic eruptions and C02 emissions. Prof Plimer’s 2009 book, Heaven and Earth, argued that humans have had a limited impact on climate, writing that “volcanoes produce more CO2 than the world’s cars and industries combined”. In 2010, he stated that “over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day”. Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption began in March 2010 and was active until June 2010.Dr Alistair Grinham, a volcano and greenhouse gas emissions researcher from the University of Queensland, told AAP FactCheck the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption only produced an estimated 0.05 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions. “(This) is less than one day of human emissions,” Dr Grinham said. According to the United Nations’ Emissions Gap Report in 2018 (executive summary), humans emit more than 50 gigatonnes of carbon annually, while the average annual carbon contribution from volcanoes is approximately 0.64 gigatonnes, according to a 2013 volcanic emissions review by the Mineralogical Society of America. The Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption in Iceland began on March 20, 2010 and was observed to be active for 95 days until June 23, 2010. The volcano was estimated to have produced a maximum of 30,000 tonnes of CO2 everyday it was active, or 0.00003 gigatonnes, according to a research report from The Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, now the James Hutton Institute, based in Scotland. The same report said the most recent human carbon emissions figures at the time had contributed 29.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, meaning over the 95 day eruption period, the Icelandic volcano put about 0.00285 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere – 10,000 times less than the human emissions at the time.Another estimate in a media report put Eyjafjallajoekull’s eruption emissions at 150,000 to 300,000 tonnes of CO2 per day. This would mean the volcano produced between 0.014 gigatonnes to 0.029 gigatonnes of carbon over the 95 day eruption period –  at least 1000 times less than the annual human emissions at around that time.Dr Grinham told AAP FactCheck the Icelandic volcano eruption was even smaller than the Philippines volcano and would not have contributed the equivalent of five years of human emissions. “The 1991 Mount Pinatubo is one of the largest eruptions in recent times and was certainly larger than the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruptions,” he said. For the claim the volcanic ash from the Eyjafjallajökull eruption had “totally erased every single effort” to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, Dr Grinham said: “The ash cloud following large eruptions events can lead to ‘global dimming’ which reduces the direct irradiance to Earth and can mask the rate of global warming.  However, this dimming is a transient effect and will not offset the warming due to greenhouse gas emissions.”Steven Sherwood, a professor of physical meteorology and atmospheric climate dynamics at the University of New South Wales, was quoted in a 2010 ABC report saying that satellite images showed the Eyjafjallajökull plume  was “not thick or expansive enough to significantly affect climate”. Claims of volcanic eruptions emitting more CO2 and negating mitigation efforts have been used previously, including a September 2019 post which falsely claimed Bali’s Mount Agung eruption had produced “more greenhouse gas in a few minutes than all of humanity since the beginning of time”. The post also claims there are “around 200 active volcanoes on the planet” spewing out volcanic ash at any one time every day. There are about 1,500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide, according to the US Geological Survey, the scientific body which researches the earth and biological data. According to the Mineralogical Society of America review, (page 340) there are around 150 volcanoes actively emitting C02 gasses on Earth. The post ends by claiming the reason why people are calling it “climate change” instead of “global warming” is because “the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century”. NASA’s Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet project which provides information about the Earth’s climate and environmental changes, states that for 2018, the annual global surface temperature was 0.8C above the average temperature for 1951 to 1980. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows a rise in global land and ocean temperatures over the past century, while November 2019 was the second-hottest November in the 140-year global climate record.","https://unfccc.int/cop25,http://archive.ph/cwY30,https://web.archive.org/web/20110717211740/http://www.ecms.adelaide.edu.au/civeng/staff/iplimer01.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13161056,https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Pinatubo,https://www.usgs.gov/news/remembering-mount-pinatubo-25-years-ago-mitigating-crisis,https://www.amazon.com.au/Heaven-Earth-Warming-Missing-Science-ebook/dp/B002ZBZK9S,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/dec/14/climate-change-sceptic-ian-plimer,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-13/29320,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1446,http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/26895/EGR2018_FullReport_EN.pdf,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e58/5f447a80c2965cb72c56945e4e9b2306833f.pdf,https://earthice.hi.is/eruption_eyjafjallajokull_2010,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/50f5/63905e8aad85754b3a3509f2fe0c4566d808.pdf,https://www.hutton.ac.uk/about,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/volcano-emitting-150-300000-tonnes-of-co2-daily-experts-5535737.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184817/http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2010/04/16/2874939.htm,http://archive.ph/FTo6i,https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-active-volcanoes-are-there-earth?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products,https://www.usgs.gov/about/about-us/who-we-are,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e58/5f447a80c2965cb72c56945e4e9b2306833f.pdf,https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/12/11/1920-2019,https://www.noaa.gov/news/november-2019-was-2nd-hottest-on-record-for-planet",Iceland and Philippines volcanic eruptions didn’t produce more CO2 than humans,,,,,,
271,,,,False,,2019-12-13,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/woolworths-has-not-stopped-buying-australian-fruit/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from December 4, 2019, by an Australian page: Tony Abbott: Leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition, featuring the headline “Woolworths Australia’s Fresh Food People TRAITORS!”.The post’s text reads: “Woolworths have to (sic) decided to source your fruit from overseas and will stop buying Australian fruits from SPC & Ardmona (sic). Let’s send them a message about putting Australians first Vote with your feet.”  The post has been shared more than 1,300 times, attracting more than 60 reactions and 30 comments. The Woolworths post first appeared on Facebook on November 17, 2016, by a South Australian user.  It was shared 143,000 times, drawing 4,400 reactions and 2,200 comments. A Facebook post claims Woolworths has decided to stop buying Australian fruit from SPC Ardmona.The AnalysisWoolworths is one of two retail giants – the other being Coles – that dominate the Australian supermarket sector. Woolworths, with 995 stores nationwide, is a crucial outlet to market for many Australian food producers. SPC Ardmona is an Australian-based company that specialises in large fruit packing and owns and operates a canning factory in Shepparton and Kyabram, Victoria. On November 8, 2016, Woolworths confirmed it was to end its year-to-year arrangement with SPC Ardmona for the supply of private-label tinned tomatoes.The move sparked condemnation as reported in The Sydney Morning Herald on the day of the announcement.In 2016 Woolworths ended its arrangement with SPC Ardmona for the supply of private-label tinned tomatoes. “Woolworths has dumped Australia’s best-known tinned tomato brand, SPC Ardmona as its private label provider after cutting a deal with a new Australian supplier for the Woolworths-brand product line,” the SMH report said.“The tomato deal has the potential to undermine SPC’s $70 million supply deal with Woolworths, which was only made on a handshake and is under review by the supermarket giant.”The supermarket giant said it would not cancel a five-year contract signed in 2014 that helped bail out the Coca-Cola Amatil-owned company. The deal saved hundreds of jobs in northern Victoria at SPC and also those working for producers. Woolworths said the year-to-year arrangement covering tinned tomatoes was separate to the 2014 contract.On June 4, 2019, Coca-Cola announced it had sold SPC Ardmona’s cannery business for $40 million to Melbourne-based Shepparton Partners Collective, which is a joint venture between Perma Funds Management and The Eights, a Sydney-based private equity firm.AAP FactCheck contacted Woolworths regarding the Facebook post and the supermarket’s spokesperson said it was false.“We’ve seen this post do the rounds on social media for a number of years now, but it is inaccurate,” the spokesperson said.“We have a strong partnership with SPC Ardmona and continue to work together to deliver the highest quality Australian-sourced products to our customers.”A spokesperson for Shepparton Partners Collective said the Facebook post was categorically untrue.“Woolworths still buys its fruit from SPC,” he told AAP FactCheck. “It’s the same old fake news from 2016 doing the rounds again. It pops up periodically and has no foundation.”In a statement, SPC Ardmona CEO Robert Giles told AAP FactCheck in an email: “Woolworths still buys its fruit from SPC and in fact has increased it this year.” On January 4, 2017, Facebook user Thomas Toogood posed the question on Woolworths’ own Facebook page: “Is it TRUE or NOT, Woolworths are going to stop buying Australian fruit and going to buy fruit from overseas?” Woolworths responded: “Hey Thomas, we’re pleased to announce that our discussions with SPC Ardmona has concluded positively, with the signing of a 3 year deal to supply us with an increased volume of deciduous fruit for our own label products. This contract reflects our strong business partnership with SPC and we look forward to continuing to work together to provide products of the highest quality and value for our customers. Thanks. (smiley face emoji)”.In terms of sourcing of fresh fruit, the Woolworths stated position from its website says “as a service to its customers, is to procure fresh produce from international sources only during periods of seasonal unavailability in Australia, or where there is a shortfall in local supply. “Woolworths also has an active import replacement program, providing opportunities and support for Australian growers to expand the range of domestic crops, to establish new varieties, or to explore new growing regions.” It should be noted that Woolworths does sell tinned fruit from overseas companies. Evidence of this can be found on the Woolworths website for products.","http://archive.ph/ihpWY,https://perma.cc/AF79-KDQE,https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/about-us/our-brands/supermarkets/Woolworths/,https://spc.com.au/our-story/,https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/woolworths-dumps-spc-ardmona-tomatoes-20161108-gskmbd.html,https://www.smh.com.au/business/woolworths-and-spc-strike-threeyear-fruit-supply-deal-20161112-gsnqei.html,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-04/coca-cola-sells-spc-cannery-for-$40-million/11176764,https://www.permafunds.com.au/about-us/,https://the8s.com.au/about/,http://archive.ph/WbvYA,https://www.wowlink.com.au/wps/portal/topic_centre?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/cmgt/wcm/connect/Content%20Library%20-%20WOWLink/WOWLink/Topic%20Centre/StandardsCompliance/Produce%20Specifications/Imports-Fruit,https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/9446/dole-pineapple-slices-in-syrup",Woolworths has not stopped buying Australian fruit,,,,,,

The media is silent, because … Islamophobia”.The caption accompanying the post reads: “Thanks Hillary Clinton” and contains a link to a 2017 opinion piece published on USA Today that blames former US Secretary of State Clinton for slave markets exposed by a media investigation in Libya.The Facebook post has attracted more than 500 shares, 70 reactions and 100 comments.The same meme appeared on a quarantined Reddit forum, r/The_Donald, in January, 2019.A Facebook post about slavery uses a photograph of actors taken at a re-enactment.The AnalysisA reverse image search reveals the photo in the post not to be slaves but performers photographed at a re-enactment of slavery at a heritage festival in 2002. The picture was taken by photographer George Esiri in Nigeria’s port town of Badagry on August 25, 2002.The photo is in the image library of international news agency Reuters and appears on the  Adobe Stock image catalogue marked “editorial use only” and with usage rights priced at up to $263.99.The photo caption reads: “Local people with chains on their necks re-enact the days of slavery in slave port town of Badagry, south-west Nigeria on August 25, 2002. More than fifty black Americans including seven mayors are in Lagos for the 2nd Black Heritage Festival which commenced with cultural activities.The initiation ceremonies will take place on Monday.”AAP FactCheck found two articles, published by the Jamaica Gleaner in 2009 and 2013,  on the topic of slavery that used the photo while noting it was a re-enactment.A screenshot from CNN’s 2017 report on slavery in Libya, which included footage taken at an auction of men sold into slavery.The post’s claim, in quote marks, that “slavery is an open market in parts in (sic) Africa & Saudi Arabia for Islam” has no attribution.The 2018 Global Slavery Index (GSI) – an independent assessment published by philanthropic foundation Walk Free – states that slavery exists in Africa and Saudi Arabia.The GSI estimates that 9.2 million men, women, and children were living in modern slavery in Africa in 2016, with the region having the highest prevalence (7.6 people for every 1,000) in the world.Neighbouring Saudi Arabia had an estimated 61,000 people trapped in modern-day slavery at the time but was lower on the prevalance ranking at 138th of 167.The report does note, however, that there are gaps in data for the Arab States region and Persian Gulf countries and that the gaps “point to a significant underestimate of the extent of modern slavery in this region”.The Facebook post’s claim that people are being sold for “$200 at open slave markets” may be based on a 2017 International Organisation for Migration (IOM) report on the experiences of West African migrants in the North African country of Libya.As recounted in multiple media reports, including from Reuters, Euronews, The Times and Al Jazeera, IOM’s Libya mission head Othman Belbeisi told journalists at a news conference in Geneva in April, 2017 that African migrants had been sold into bondage at Libyan slave markets for “between 200 and 500 dollars”.Reporters with US news channel CNN uncovered first-hand evidence of the slave trade later that year, secretly filming a clandestine slave auction in Libya where people were sold.Regarding the post’s claim that the slavery market is “for Islam”, the GIS report shows a mix of religions among African nations that appear in the top 10 for prevalence of slavery.Eritrea (second) is an equal mix of Christianity and Islam according to the CIA World Factbook, Burundi (third) is majority Christian, Central African Republic (fourth) is a mix of indigenous beliefs and Christianity with a small proportion of Islam, Mauritania (sixth) is a Muslim country and South Sudan (seventh) is majority Christian.Afghanistan (fifth), Pakistan (eighth) and Iran (10th) – all Muslim faith nations – are also in the top 10 the list while fellow Islamic nation Libya ranked 29th.Authoritarian state North Korea, which is traditionally Bhuddist, topped the world for the highest prevalence of modern slavery.The GIS report states that of the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of slavery, the two major drivers are highly repressive regimes and conflict.Russia and China are listed among the countries with the largest estimated total number – as opposed to per-capita rate – of people in modern slavery.Finally, the post claims that “the media is silent because … islamophobia” – an apparent  implication that the media is not reporting on slavery in Muslim nations out of a fear of being seen to be endorsing anti-Muslim sentiment. Contradicting this claim is the fact that there are multiple media reports, previously alluded to, on the slavery situation in Libya, and there is reporting more broadly on the slavery situation in Libya and Africa.","http://archive.today/cahei,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/11/27/clinton-ponders-2020-run-lets-not-forget-her-real-libya-scandal-glenn-reynolds-column/895853001/?fbclid=IwAR1q1oaTYsZAwNY3FBf12eB_V83r0QTI5BsSMhSzsVa6-GJjcKN5IT7gDec,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/akh33g/dam_u_constantine_for_creating_islam_pretty_evily/,http://archive.today/KSPFx,http://archive.today/u4Fep,http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130728/focus/focus3.html,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/highlights/,https://www.minderoo.com.au/walk-free/,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/regional-analysis/africa/,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/data/country-data/saudi-arabia/,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/methodology/prevalence/,https://www.iom.int/news/iom-learns-slave-market-conditions-endangering-migrants-north-africa,http://archive.today/Rye8A,http://archive.today/EqQRy,http://archive.today/fPYYZ,http://archive.today/J4FbK,http://archive.today/QeKgx,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/global-findings/,https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/401.html#ER,https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/global-findings/,http://archive.today/sP63o,http://archive.today/0DJeC",Africa “slave markets” photo is of actors at a re-enactment,,,,,,

The artist had then “toned it down” in Photoshop to appear more as a “nightscape” and added a shot of the Milky Way above the horizon. “It’s not the worst shop, but not the best, either,” the user wrote. Odgers, who clearly identifies himself in a “self portrait” posted on his Reddit page in May 2013, confirmed his critic was “correct on all counts”. British astronaut Major Tim Peake captured a real photo of the Grand Canyon from space.“Yeah this is actually not the finished version, but the one that has traveled the net the most lol. I am that guy and yes you are correct on all counts,” Odgers wrote.“Side note: I made this image in the first week of learning how to use Photoshop with (an) old copy of Cs3.”Odgers used this composite image technique again in 2012, placing stars above a picture he’d captured from the window of a Boeing 747 while flying over North America. A Flickr user alerted Odgers that his photo was “doing the rounds” uncredited in a Twitter post under the title ‘The Grand Canyon seen from space’ six years ago. The post has since been deleted however, other examples remain on Twitter. Odgers main gripe with the reposts stemmed from the unauthorised application of a photo filter.“It’s is (sic) everywhere now. It doesn’t bother me that people are throwing it around without credit so much as that there is an ugly Sepia tone version going around… so ugly,” he wrote on Flickr.British astronaut and photographer Major Tim Peake captured a real photo of the Grand Canyon from space uploading it on Flickr in May 2016.  Peake’s image and others from space that show the canyon framed from above without the sky or stars. Hoaxeye, a Finland-based blog that identifies fake or hoax pictures, published a fact check on Odgers’ photo in February 2019.","http://archive.ph/OJS7j,https://www.flickr.com/photos/omgnicepicturebro/7648088744/,https://www.flickr.com/people/omgnicepicturebro/,https://www.flickr.com/photos/omgnicepicturebro/7697691834/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/10m5n4/grand_canyon_arizona_united_states_by_travis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1eo179/self_portrait_by_travis_odgers/,https://www.flickr.com/photos/omgnicepicturebro/6465903093,https://www.flickr.com/photos/omgnicepicturebro/7249001066/,https://www.flickr.com/photos/omgnicepicturebro/7248997142/,https://twitter.com/Globe_Pics/status/346364084083646464,https://twitter.com/thatsearth/status/530847438069063680,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Peake,https://www.flickr.com/photos/timpeake/27330083035/,https://imgur.com/a/93y8I,https://hoaxeye.com/2019/02/24/grand-canyon-from-space/",Grand Canyon from space image is a Photoshop fake,,,,,,

The post contains an image of Samoa’s two main islands overlaid with text. Under a headline “SAMOA – Measles Timeline“, the text has bullet points stating: “*September: No measles outbreaks!” , “*October: 115,500 measles vaccines sent by UNICEF, “*November: Over 33,000 have been vaccinated for Measles.” and “*Also November: State of Emergency over Outbreaks of Measles.”The post ends with text that reads “ANY QUESTIONS?” and a hashtag “#StopMandatoryVaccination”.The post has been shared more than 230 times and attracted more than 280 reactions and 10 comments while an identical post by another Australian user has garnered more than 270 shares.A post from December 8 claiming to show a timeline of Samoa’s measles outbreak contains inaccuracies.The AnalysisSamoa is in the grip of a measles epidemic which has killed at least 71 people and affected more than 4,800 people since the outbreak started.Samoa’s rate of vaccination had fallen following the death in 2018 of two babies who were given incorrectly prepared vaccines. Two nurses were charged with negligence causing manslaughter after one mixed the doses with outdated anaesthetic instead of water. The two have since been jailed.The Samoan government suspended the national immunisation program for months after the deaths before it resumed in April 2019. During that time the nation’s vaccination rate fell to around 30 per cent, according to World Health Organization and UNICEF estimates.Contrary to the claim in the post, there were measles outbreaks in Samoa in September. Samoa’s government dispatched 28 specimens of suspected measles cases to Australia for testing on September 30, 2019.According to Australia’s Department of Health measles infection happens 10 to 12 days before symptoms appear.People outside a health emergency operation centre in Apia, Samoa on December 5, 2019. Samoa’s Ministry of Health announced on October 9 that a suspected measles case “may be transmitted from the Auckland outbreak.” New Zealand has been battling its own measles outbreak with at least 2,060 confirmed measles cases this year.The Samoan Ministry of Health declared a measles epidemic on October 16, following the receipt of test results.In its statement, the Ministry of Health said that of the 28 specimens sent to Melbourne on September 30, 2019 for testing, it had received 12 results with four confirmed cases of measles.Of eight additional specimens sent on October 2, results received on October 16 showed three more confirmed cases.“A total of seven confirmed cases have been reported to date. In anticipation, we now confirm a Measles Epidemic,” the Ministry of Health said.Humanitarian agency UNICEF announced on November 28 that it had sent 115,500 doses of measles vaccines to Samoa since October 1, 2019.However Samoa’s national Measles Vaccination Campaign did not start until November 20 – five days after the government had declared a state of emergency on November 15.In its November 28 statement, UNICEF said that 33,500 people had been vaccinated since the campaign start on November 20.In an update via its Twitter account on December 11, the Government of Samoa said 4,898 measles cases had been reported since the nation’s outbreak began and, as of December 10, more than 91 per cent of the Samoan population have been vaccinated against measles.","https://www.facebook.com/nojabnopaynoway/photos/a.860688197302708/2606966152674895/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2694217363968262&set=a.100642043325820&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1204544338329366528,https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/405268/samoa-measles-death-toll-rises-to-71,http://archive.today/MucRU,https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/386249/samoa-mmr-vaccinations-to-resume-on-april-15,https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/wsm.pdf,https://reliefweb.int/report/samoa/ministry-health-press-release-1-measles-epidemic,https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/measles,http://archive.today/PevYc,https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/measles/2019-measles-outbreak-information,http://archive.today/ca4ds,https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/press-releases/news-note-2-pacific-measles-outbreak,http://archive.today/iBhyl",Samoa “measles timeline” ignores reality of epidemic spread,,,,,,

The report said there had been 100 explosions in the first 10 months of 2019 – more than double for the same period in 2018.Commenting on 2019’s wave of bombings, Ylva Ehrlin, a bomb squad analyst, was quoted in a Guardian article saying: “There are 10 million people in Sweden and I have not found the equivalent of this level of explosions in any industrialised country.”AAP FactCheck was unable to find data that Sweden “had the highest number of bombings in the West” but two officials say 2019’s rise has no equivalent internationally. Sweden’s National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå) website says comparisons of Swedish crime statistics with other nations are difficult to make due to “legal and statistical factors” in the Nordic nation. “In some countries an event is only recorded in the crime statistics if, after investigation, it can legitimately be considered a crime or when there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed. Swedish statistics, on the other hand, record all reported events as crimes even if some of them are later found not to have constituted criminal offences,” Brå says. While AAP FactCheck was unable to find data that Sweden “had the highest number of bombings in the West”, two officials – a police chief and bomb squad analyst – say this year’s rise has no equivalent internationally. For the claim in the post of 200 bombings “this year”, a 2018 report by Sweden Radio (Sveriges Radio) said the National Forensic Centre investigated 211 cases involving explosives in 2017. For 2019, several media reports listed the number of bombings at around 100. Regarding the claim that Sweden has the highest number of rapes in Europe, a 2017 report by the statistics agency Eurostat showed that, on a population basis, Sweden was second behind England and Wales for occurrence of the crime. Sweden recorded 57 rapes per 100,000 people. The report did state that Sweden had the highest number of violent sexual crimes at 178 per 100,000 people ahead of Scotland (163), Northern Ireland (156), England and Wales (113).Sweden’s (Brå) reported that rapes increased by 10 per cent in 2017. A report by The Local website said rapes reached a total of 7,230 for that year.  Brå says, in a 2011 article, that the nation’s legal definition of rape and its extensive reporting of the crime means “more sexual crimes are registered as rape (in Sweden) than in most other countries”. In 2018, Sweden became one of only 10 countries in Western Europe, including the member nations of the United Kingdom, to legally recognise that sex without consent is rape. Criminal laws elsewhere define rape on the basis of physical force or threats of force, coercion or inability to defend oneself. On the issue of Sweden having the “highest number of young men killed in shootings in the West”, AAP FactCheck found evidence to support the claim. A study published by the European Journal of Criminal Research in May 2018 examined gun violence rates among males in Sweden from 1996 to 2015. The study reported that “the rate of gun homicide victimisation among males 15 to 29 years was higher in Sweden compared to other Western European countries”. The data for Sweden was collected from three official agencies – the National Patient Register, National Cause-of-death Registry and the National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå). Data on lethal gun violence for males aged 15 to 29 was sourced from a database of Cause-of-Death statistics by the World Health Organization. Addressing the post’s claim that “crime is out of control”, Sweden’s Brå reported in June that while violent crime had risen in the Scandinavian country, it was still below levels recorded in the 1990s.","http://archive.ph/iwGeL,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/sweden-bomb-attacks-reach-unprecedented-level-as-gangs-feud,https://www.ft.com/content/9c0d30ea-eb46-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977,https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/02/violent-crime-in-sweden-is-soaring-when-will-politicians-act/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/europe/denmark-border-sweden.html,https://www.thelocal.se/20191108/swedish-police-chief-no-international-equivalent-to-swedens-wave-of-bombings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/sweden-bomb-attacks-reach-unprecedented-level-as-gangs-feud,https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/international-comparisons.html,https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=6945601,https://nfc.polisen.se/en/,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20171123-1,https://www.thelocal.se/20180118/reported-rapes-in-sweden-up-by-10-percent,https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/news-from-bra/archive/news/2011-01-18-how-common-is-rape-in-sweden-compared-to-other-european-countries.html,https://time.com/5288303/sweden-affirmative-consent-rape-law/,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0,https://www.thelocal.se/20191108/swedish-police-chief-no-international-equivalent-to-swedens-wave-of-bombings",Swedish crime stats claims not clear cut,,,,,,
276,,,,False,,2019-12-10,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/churchill-what-are-we-fighting-for-quote-is-an-artistic-creation/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA quote attributed to Britain’s art-loving wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, has been circulating on social media after Australia’s current prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a restructure of the public service.Mr Morrison’s move means that, from February 2020, no department will have “Arts” in its title. It has prompted many people to share a post which features a photo of Churchill and reads: “When Winston Churchill was asked to cut arts funding in favour of the war effort, he simply replied, ‘then what are we fighting for?’.”AAP FactCheck examined a version of the post from an Australia user on December 6, 2019 to determine if the statement was made by Churchill as claimed. The post in this instance includes a caption that reads: “Scott Morrison is a weak leader”.The post has gathered more than 1,300 shares, 100 reactions and 20 comments.AAP FactCheck found more than 50 versions of the post – attracting more than 9,000 shares between them – published online since Mr Morrison’s December 5 announcement.A Facebook post attributes a quote about arts funding during wartime to British WWII leader Winston Churchill.The AnalysisWinston Churchill led Britain to victory in World War II and built a reputation as an orator through his impassioned speeches.Churchill researchers and fact-checkers alike have probed the veracity of the art quote story, which purportedly showcases the former prime minister’s support for the arts as war raged across the globe.US fact-checking group Snopes found it to be false after, in a parallel to Australia’s recent spate of posts, the alleged quote appeared in meme form in 2017 as President Donald Trump pondered cuts to his government’s arts and humanities agency.PolitiFact echoed that verdict in a check from April, 2019.As cited in both fact checks, US historian and Churchill authority Richard Langworth has previously addressed the origin and legitimacy of the quote.Winston Churchill with his Clementine in Essex, England in 1945.“This alleged quotation was raised some few years ago in the Village Voice and is all over the web, but it is not among Churchill’s 15 million published words in speeches, papers, letters, articles or books,” he wrote in a 2009 blog post.Timothy Riley, chief curator of the National Churchill Museum agreed that the supposed quote is without foundation. “There is no written record to confirm Churchill wrote those words and or even a recollection by the statesman’s contemporaries that Winston Churchill uttered the statement in conversation,” Mr Riley said in an email to AAP FactCheck.Mr Riley said the quote had form and even he, a Churchill expert, had mistakenly assigned it to Churchill in the past.“It is (a) common misattribution,” he told AAP FactCheck.“One, I must confess, I cited erroneously many years ago.”Churchill had a well-known passion for painting, Mr Riley said, and once compared composing a piece to fighting a battle in a 1921-22 essay entitled Painting as a Pastime.“Art, for Churchill, sharpened his mind, which served him well in all of his endeavors,” Mr Riley said.This view of Churchill’s stance on the arts is in keeping with a speech he gave to the Royal Academy in 1953.“The arts are essential to any complete national life. The nation owes it to itself to sustain and encourage them,” Churchill said.Lee Pollock, interim executive director at The International Churchill Society, told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post quote “sounds Churchillian but there is no attribution for it”.“But Churchill believed in the importance of the arts to society,” he said.Britain, in fact, did make efforts to ensure the sustainability of the arts during World War II, establishing the Committee for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts.But this initiative was launched in January 1940, before Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister in May that year.AAP FactCheck also searched for the quote in the International Churchill Society quotes archive and the “50 Sir Winston Churchill Quotes to Live By” collated by BBC America, but could not find any evidence to link it to him.","http://archive.today/10cDh,http://archive.today/JXSPh,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winston-Churchill,https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/winston-churchill-on-the-arts/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/apr/02/viral-image/no-winston-churchill-didnt-say-what-are-we-fightin/,https://richardlangworth.com/about,http://archive.today/H02Bw,https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/,https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/churchillws-paintingasapastime/churchillws-paintingasapastime-00-h-dir/churchillws-paintingasapastime-00-h.html,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=faLfAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60&dq=%22The+arts+are+essential+to+any+complete+national+life%22+churchill&source=bl&ots=DYQTqt-GH4&sig=Ce_EOqpGTXcXvaYT14RlrjFYhYE&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=The%20nation%20owes%20it%20to%20itself%20to%20sustain%20and%20encourage%20them&f=false,https://winstonchurchill.org/,https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=41949,http://archive.today/scSao,https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/,http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/04/50-churchill-quotes",Churchill “what are we fighting for” quote is an artistic creation,,,,,,
277,,,,Partly False,,2019-12-04,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/margarine-turkey-fattener-post-mixes-some-facts-with-fiction/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post which makes some alarming claims about margarine, including that it was originally created to fatten turkeys and was supposedly repurposed as food for people “when it killed the turkeys”.The October 7, 2019 post on a US page called Sprinkles, Please includes a list of claims about the chemical nature of margarine, the fat content in the spread and its effects on heart health and other bodily functions. Sprinkles, Please is listed as a chocolate shop and bakery business and has more than 440 page likes.The post has been shared more than 7100 times and attracted more than 770 comments and 1200 reactions.A truncated version of the post has been shared by Australian “self care” page, Tolman Self Care.A Facebook post makes a series of claims about margarine and its purported health effects, including that the spread was a failed turkey-fattener before it was repurposed as food for humans.The AnalysisVarious comparisons of the claimed health effects of butter and margarine have been circulating online since at least 2003, according to US fact-checkers Snopes.This post starts with the claim: “Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys” but US food historian Sarah Wassberg Johnson told AAP FactCheck “oleomargarine” – now known as  margarine – was originally invented in France at the direction of the emperor Napoleon III in 1869.Napoleon held a contest to find a suitable substitute for butter in response to a price rise and  a chemist won with his invention of margarine. As claimed in the post, margarine when first sold in the US was white in colour due to laws that prevented it being pre-coloured yellow to protect the butter industry, Dr Wassberg Johnson told AAP FactCheck in an email.Margarine was white, and sold with a yellow dye, in its early days but is now sold yellow.“Many manufacturers included a little capsule of yellow annatto dye to be kneaded in by discerning housewives, because the creamy white texture too closely resembled lard,” Dr Wassberg Johnson said.The post makes a number of claims about the fat content in margarine compared to butter, including that butter and margarine have the same amount of calories but butter is slightly higher in saturated fats compared to margarine. Dietitian Evangeline Mantzioris, nutrition and food sciences program director at the University of South Australia, told AAP FactCheck there is a “very slight difference” in the calorie content of both spreads.“Some margarine uses quite a lot of saturated fat to make it – others don’t,” Dr Mantzioris said in a phone interview.“It depends on the formulation of how margarine is made up.”The post also claims eating margarine “triples the risk of coronary heart disease” and can “increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study”.A 1993 study led by Harvard School of Public Health’s Professor Walter Willett did find, after studying a large cohort of nurses for 10 years, that consumption of trans fats such as those found in margarine, was directly linked to risk of coronary heart disease. The study also found that the link was stronger for the women who had regularly eaten margarine over the period.Professor Willett confirmed that finding in a 2018 interview, however it is not clear that the study compared butter and margarine consumption.In 2017 Professor Willett said there had been “a lot of confusion about the role of butter in a diet” and advocated replacing butter with liquid plant oils such as olive oil.“If you compare butter with the old high trans margarines, almost for sure butter was the healthier choice, but those old margarines are pretty much off the market now and almost all of them are trans free at this point in time.”Dr Mantzioris told AAP FactCheck that “many years ago, margarine had trans fatty acids in it and yes, that is more likely to increase people’s risk of having heart disease”. “But Australia has virtually eliminated trans fatty acids in fats and oils since the 1990s,” she said.“Australia was one of the first countries to really reduce the trans fatty acids that we put in margarine – so that’s probably relevant in other countries but not here.”Another claim in the post is that margarine “increases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)”. LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins and HDL for high-density lipoproteins.Dr Mantzioris said the accuracy of the statement depends, once again, on the composition of the margarine.“Anything that comes from a plant does not have cholesterol in it. So sunflower oil, olive oil, vegetable oil, coconut fat, palm oil do not contain cholesterol. You only find cholesterol in animal-based products,” she said.“But the margarines that contain saturated-based fats in them like coconut and palm oil have the potential to raise blood lipids, so once again it is very important to look at what the margarine is made from.”The post makes claims contrasting the supposed effects of butter and margarine on the human body, including that margarine “increases the risk of cancers”, “decreases insulin response”, and “lowers the quality of breast milk”.A spokesperson for Cancer Council Australia told AAP FactCheck in an email there was “no evidence to show that margarine increases cancer risk up to five times”.“Although some laboratory-based studies have raised concerns about margarine and cancer risk, large-scale population studies have not shown this to be an issue,” the spokesperson said.Dr Mantzioris said the claim regarding breast milk was “very generalised” and not clear.“Breast milk largely stays very similar from woman to woman in terms of the protein levels, the fat levels, the carbohydrate levels but what we know is when women consume more different types of fat, those different types of fat are reflected in their breast milk,” she said.“So if someone eats more saturated fats, they will get more saturated fat in their breast milk. If they consume more fish, they will have higher levels of omega-3 fats.”Dr Mantzioris told AAP FactCheck the claim about insulin response was “vague”.“The most important aspect of reducing insulin levels in your body is to reduce the intake of foods that contain added sugars. Fat has a small impact on insulin release and there would not be much difference between consuming normal amounts of margarine or butter.”The post ends with what it claims is “the most disturbing fact” – that margarine “is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC… and shares 27 ingredients with PAINT”.Dr Mantzioris described the claim as being “highly provocative”. “Many things are one molecule away from lots of other different things, it doesn’t mean that they are equivalent or that they will change into that thing,” she said.Regarding the post’s claim that margarine “does not rot or smell differently because it has no nutritional value”, Dr Mantzioris said butter and margarine can both turn rancid when oils oxidise, resulting in a “rancid smell”. “This also happens to nuts, you know when you have old nuts and they smell, that’s just rancidity, that’s the fats oxidising because of their exposure to air.  It is best to avoid any fats or foods that have oxidized (rancid), as consuming them will increase your body’s exposure to free radicals, which can be potentially harmful,” she said.","https://www.facebook.com/sprinklespleasee/photos/a.354076998405691/699194887227232/?type=3&theater,https://www.latest.facebook.com/TolmanSelfCare/photos/a.659855424035501/2066550436699319/?type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-butter-truth/,http://www.thefoodhistorian.com/about.html,https://www.jstor.org/stable/800398?mag=when-margarine-was-contraband&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents,https://people.unisa.edu.au/Evangeline.Mantzioris,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8094827,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/walter-willett/,http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/64/1/13,https://www.medpagetoday.com/primarycare/dietnutrition/62964,https://www.cancer.org.au/about-us/",Margarine “turkey fattener” post mixes some facts with fiction,,,,,,
278,,,,Partly False,,2019-12-03,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/cruise-control-warning-a-slippery-mix-of-claims/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from June 17, 2019 by a private user, which claimed using cruise control in wet weather can cause your car to accelerate further if it hydroplanes, and take off “like an airplane”. The post features an image of a police investigator taking photos of a car that has crashed into tree and recounts a story of a police officer warning a 36-year-old woman of the dangers of driving with cruise control switched on.An excerpt of the post says, “The Police Officer told her that if the cruise control is on, your car will begin to hydro-plane when the tires (sic) lose contact with the road, and your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed making you take off like an airplane.”The post, which has been shared by Australian users, has attracted more than 6000 shares and amassed over 1000 reactions.A Facebook post from June 17, 2019 claims that using cruise control in wet weather can cause your car to accelerate and hydroplane.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found the post dated back to at least September 2013, when it appeared on the Wildhorse Entertainment South Africa news (WHISNews21) site. The website states it is for “independent superstars needing a platform to publish all their music news and revues (sic) worldwide”. The origin of text in the post goes back further. In November 2002 US fact checkers Snopes looked at a similar version circulated via email and found the post, which listed US locations, contained true and false information.Snopes said the post’s warning not to use cruise control in the rain was “well worth heeding” but the explanation about a hydroplaning car’s sudden acceleration and “taking off like a rocket” due to the use of cruise control was “garbled” and a “misunderstanding of what had occurred”. The NRMA defined hydroplaning (or aquaplaning) as when a car tyre fails to disperse water and rides “on a plane of water”.Road services organisation the NRMA has previously responded to a version of the email circulated in Australia in an article titled, “The truth about cruise control and aquaplaning”. The NRMA article, which appears to have been published in 2018 according to web archiver Wayback Machine,  explains that cruise control works by constantly measuring the speed of the wheels on a car, which is fed into the cruise control system to regulate the engine’s output. “Under a condition where the driving wheels have broken traction, such as an aquaplane situation, the sensor would measure an increase in wheel speed,” the article says.“The cruise control system would then reduce the amount of throttle and maintain the set speed. (This is the complete opposite to what is claimed in the email to have occurred and causing the accident.)”The NRMA defined hydroplaning or aquaplaning as when a tyre “(particularly if worn)” fails to disperse water and rides “on a plane of water”, thus losing contact with the road surface.“Wet roads significantly affect the grip of the tyres and this in turn can make corrective actions by the driver much more difficult to judge. Accordingly, the driver should assess the conditions of the road and adjust vehicle speed so it is suitable for the road.”NRMA pointed out the safest way to drive a car is “to ensure that under all driving conditions you can control the vehicle”.“Many owner’s manuals suggest cruise control should not be used in heavy traffic driving, city driving, and winding, undulating, slippery or unsealed roads.”Regarding the post’s claims, a spokesperson for Transport for NSW, the NSW government roads and transport agency, told AAP FactCheck in an email: “There is no truth to this post. Typically aquaplaning occurs during either hard acceleration or braking, neither of which occur at the same time that cruise control is actually engaged.”The Facebook post was addressed in Australia as far back as April, 2006, when an article on the website carsales.com.au concluded “the advice might be sound advice but not for the reasons given. Aquaplaning (sometimes referred to ‘hydroplaning’) can happen if there is standing water whether cruise control is in operation or not. Indeed, far from being the absolute cause, cruise control is almost a red herring in the above scenario.”","http://archive.ph/JrqDN,https://whisnews21.com/2013/09/14/a-warning-for-those-with-cruise-control/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wild-when-wet/,https://web.archive.org/web/20180409143708/https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving/driver-training-and-licences/resources/the-truth-about-cruise-control-and-aquaplaning,https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/cruise-control-and-aquaplaning-the-facts-7413/?utm_source=carpoint",Cruise control warning a slippery mix of claims,,,,,,
279,,,,False,,2019-12-02,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/stolen-pensions-post-recycles-misinformation/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementA lengthy Facebook post from an Australian user starts with a headline that reads: “OLD AGE PENSION QUIETLY CHANGED TO WELFARE PAYMENT” and a claim that the age pension is now (or soon will be) referred to as “Low Income Aged Persons Welfare”. It also claims that “7.5% of our wages deducted before tax for the whole of our working lives has been stolen by both sides of politics”.AAP FactCheck examined the post, which goes on to provide calculations purporting to show the value at retirement of money “harvested by the government pension fund”, claiming: “If you calculate the future value of your monthly investment in a pension ($375/month at a meager 1% interest rate compounded monthly), after 40 years of working you’d have more than $1.3+ million dollars saved!”It continues with a claim that “the thieves in Canberra … took our money and used it elsewhere. They forgot (oh yes, they knew) that it was OUR money they were taking.”The post concludes with a call to “Demand that our MP’s (sic) bring some sense into our government. Find a way to keep Old Age Pension going for the sake of that 92% of our population who need it. Then call it what it is: Our Earned Retirement Income”.The post has been shared more than 6700 times and attracted more than 800 reactions and 480 comments.A Facebook post from November 20 claims the Age Pension is to be renamed as welfare – a claim that has circulated before in Australia and the United States.The AnalysisThe claim that the name of the Australian government Age Pension has been or is about to be changed to “Welfare Payment” has been circulating on social media, and previously viral email, for some years. AAP FactCheck examined another example of the claim in October, 2019, and found it to be false. A spokesperson for the federal Families and Social Services Minister, Anne Ruston, advised AAP FactCheck at the time that the information contained in the Facebook post “bears no relation to Austrailan Age Pension provisions.” The spokesperson also advised the text was based on a viral email that originated in the United States several years ago and has since been circulated around the world.The claim has also been debunked in the US by fact checking organisation Snopes and a US news outlet.According to the Australian Government’s Department of Human Services website, the payment is still referred to as Age Pension.The “7.5% of our wages deducted before tax for the whole of our working lives” is also a claim which has been circulating in various forms for some time. AAP FactCheck also examined this claim as part of a broader investigation in October, 2019 and found it to be false.Professor Peter Whiteford, from the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, told AAP FactCheck in October that a National Welfare Fund was set up in Australia in 1943 as part of new social security measures.A researcher says a belief that 7.5 per cent of wages was put aside for workers in retirement funds may have arisen from the rate of a now-defunct levy.“From 1945/1946 there was also a Social Services Contribution, which was in fact no more than an extra tax on income and was merged with income tax five years later,” Professor Whiteford said.A 1985 paper by I. Scott, of the Education and Welfare Group in the Australian Parliamentary Library, states on page 2 that the fund was established with the smaller of either £30 million (this is in pre-decimal currency Australia) drawn from consolidated government revenue or one quarter of individual income tax receipts.In 1945 Prime Minister Ben Chifley split income tax into two parts to create a separate levy to finance social security payments. The Parliamentary Library paper states on page 4 that this separate levy “created a mistaken belief in some quarters that the social services were thereby placed on a contributory basis”.David Stanton, from the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University and a former senior official in the Department of Social Security told AAP FactCheck in October that claims a percentage of taxpayers’ wages was set aside in a separate retirement fund most likely arose from the maximum rate of social services contribution in 1946, which was one shilling and sixpence in the pound – equal to 7.5 per cent.More details of the history of the National Welfare Fund can be found in the AAP FactCheck report.The Facebook post’s calculations of supposed future retirement income are also not accurate.While the post claims a monthly deposit of $375 over 40 years would, with one per cent compound interest compounded monthly, deliver “more than $1.3 million saved”, the ASIC Moneysmart compound interest calculator shows that the amount saved would in fact be just under $220,000.The post also claims “today’s average Old Age Pension benefit” is $1,230 per month. However the Australian government’s Department of Human Services website shows the maximum basic rate a person on the Age Pension can get is $850.40 a fortnight. Multiplying this figure by 26 (the number of fortnights in a year) and dividing it by 12 (the number of months) equates to $1,842.53 a month. The total rises to $933.40 a fortnight if the recipient is eligible for all available supplement payments. This equals $2,022.37 a month.While the source of the post’s $1,230 per month figure is not stated, the same amount appears on an archived web page of the United States Social Security Administration under a section titled “Average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired worker”.

If you don’t have Bluetooth, you must safely park your car, turn off your car engine, and then you can answer your phone.A Facebook post claims Australia has passed laws making it illegal to touch a mobile phone while driving or with engine running.Keep in mind that even if you have stopped to park, if your engine is still running, your use of your phone will still be sanctioned by law.So if you don’t have Bluetooth, stop before you answer your phone and turn off the car engine.The driver’s license is very important, the phone can wait!Remember to remember! ! ! !Please forward your friends and family as soon as possible.”The post has been shared about 4,600 times and gathered more than 700 comments and 400 reactions.The AnalysisThe earliest trace AAP FactCheck found of the text was posted by an Australian Chinese restaurant chain in February, 2018. A Vietnamese translation accompanied the English text. It resurfaced on the page of a WA-based driving school in July, 2018. The two posts received just over 50 shares between them.Almost 18 months later, the post was republished in Arabic and English on a page for Jordanian expats in Australia on November 19, 2019 before being posted by the NSW user later that same night.The first part of the post makes a reference to Australia passing these alleged laws in parliament.NSW Drivers can use a phone hands-free for calls and audio if they use Bluetooth or voice activation, and are allowed to hold a phone if passing it to a passenger.All road regulation is handled by state parliaments, not the federal government, meaning there is no one set of national road rules for all drivers.For example, NSW Road Rules legislation states a driver on a full licence can use a phone to make or receive an audio phone call, to play audio, or as a navigation tool if the device is in a fixed cradle and doesn’t obscure the driver’s vision.Drivers can also use the phone hands-free for calls and audio if they use Bluetooth or voice activation, and are allowed to hold a phone if passing it to a passenger.So, contrary to the claim in the post, unrestricted licence drivers in NSW can touch their phone in some instances.Provisional and learner drivers, however, are not permitted to use the three aforementioned mobile phone functions at any time while driving.In addition, the state’s maximum penalty for mobile phone road rule breaches is up to 20 penalty units, or $2,200, and not a three-month driving suspension.The post also claims the ignition of the car must be turned off when parked for the driver to be legally allowed to use their phone.But Transport for NSW, the NSW state government transport agency, states that this is not the case. “To use a mobile phone, you must be parked out of the line of traffic. However, the ignition does not need to be turned off,” the agency says in the FAQ section of its “Know the Rules” web page.Through internet archives, AAP FactCheck found that the FAQ question and response was added after the most recent snapshot of the page on October 28, 2019. Transport for NSW confirmed that information was accurate.“If you want to use a hand-held mobile phone your vehicle must be parked. The road rules do not explicitly require that the ignition be turned off,” a Transport for NSW spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email.NSW Police has conflicting advice in a video posted to its Facebook page in August, 2018: “Drivers can only use a hand-held mobile phone if their vehicle is parked in an authorised parking spot with the engine turned off.”However, when approached by AAP FactCheck, NSW Police said Transport for NSW’s information was “correct”.“Vehicle must be parked and ignition does not have to be turned off,” a NSW Police spokesperson said.The motor on/off rule is different in Western Australia, where drivers must be legally parked and have their engine turned off before being allowed to hold a phone.The rules on touching the phone are similar to those in NSW: drivers can touch a phone to receive and end calls if it is secured in a holder but a phone can only  be used for navigation if it is in a holder and the driver does not touch it.","http://archive.ph/1iM1w,http://archive.ph/F8PJi,http://archive.ph/8Bp6n,http://archive.ph/QgILS,https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2014/758/part18/div1/rule300,https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/,https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/mobilephones/know-the-rules.html#,https://web.archive.org/web/20191028225100/https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/mobilephones/know-the-rules.html,https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2041922799227317,https://roadrules.rsc.wa.gov.au/road-rules/mobile-phones",Inaccurate claims about mobile phones in cars,,,,,,

About 30 minutes later Daisy returns with James’ boss, who the golden retriever picked up on the 112th floor. The dog leads the pair as part of a group of 300 people out of the burning building. She returns to rescue 392 others before returning to the building a third time to rescue 273 people – a total of 967 lives. For her bravery Daisy was purportedly awarded the Medal of Honour for New York, the “first civilian canine” to receive such an award. The post has been shared more than 4300 times and attracted more than 570 reactions.A Facebook post features a video of Daisy, a guide dog, who supposedly rescued hundreds of people from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The AnalysisThe story of a heroic dog named Daisy, who saved nearly 1000 lives after planes were flown into the World Trade Centre towers, first appeared online shortly after the attacks on September 11, 2001. The video claims, following the first plane crashing into “tower 1 of the World Trade Centre”, Crane released Daisy who “darted away into the darkened hallway”, knowing he himself “was doomed”. After 30 minutes, the video says Daisy came back with Crane’s boss who she “happened to pick up on floor 112 on her first run of the building” and successfully led both out of the damaged building before going back in two more times to save 967 others. The World Trade Center had a total of 110 floors, not 112 as the video claims. The World Trade Centre had a total of 110 floors, not 112 as the Facebook post claims. The video states Crane worked on the 101st floor when the planes crashed into the towers. According to the New York Times, evidence showed 1100 or more people who were situated in or above the impact zone survived the initial impact until their building collapsed. At least 28 people were rescued on the 86th and 89th floors. While there were examples of dogs who led their owners to safety such as Salty and Roselle, there were none named Daisy and neither of the two dogs mentioned went back into the towers to rescue others. In the case of Salty, owner Omar Rivera said he let the dog go, but the yellow Labrador Retriever “refused to leave me. He came back to me. He said, ‘We are together. As long as we are in here, we are together’.” Salty and Roselle were awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal, the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross, for their bravery but there is no evidence they were awarded the “Medal of Honor of New York City”.","https://www.facebook.com/NettieM.M/videos/vb.1021057212/10219029212054170/?type=2&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/daisy-dog-rescued-911-survivors/,https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/world-trade-center,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/nyregion/fighting-to-live-as-the-towers-died.html,https://www.today.com/pets/salty-relative-wrangler-s-led-blind-owner-safety-71st-floor-t43471,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-blind-man-his-guide-dog-and-lessons-learned-on-9-11,https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do/animal-awards-programme/pdsa-dickin-medal,https://www.ny.gov/new-york-state-wwi-centennial-commission/new-yorks-medal-honor-recipients",Daisy the dog didn’t save 967 people in the 9/11 attacks,,,,,,

AAP FactCheck’s investigation would suggest he absolutely has not.The article in question has an ABC News logo – from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation – in the top left of the page but the page URL – in this instance “mirrorau.com/gibson/” is not a genuine ABC link. The article claims Gibson appeared on The Project and “announced a new ‘wealth loophole’ which he says can transform anyone into a millionaire within 3-4 months”.It goes on to claim Gibson told Aly about his “number one money-maker” which was “a new cryptocurrency auto-trading program”. Aly’s name is misspelled as “Ali” throughout the text.The name of the supposed trading program, Bitcoin Revolution, is hyperlinked and leads to a page of the same name which urges people to sign up and put $US250 into an account.AAP FactCheck searched The Project’s Facebook archives and the only instance found of Mel Gibson being on the program was a November 2017 interview for his then new movie, Daddy’s Home 2.Virgin boss Richard Branson has warned about online scams claiming to be linked to him, labelling them “fake” and urging people to report them.The article then lists a supposed “ABC NEWS EXCLUSIVE WITH MEL GIBSON” with a photo of Gibson bearing an ABC News logo.AAP FactCheck traced the image and found it is a screenshot from an interview Gibson did on the US ABC News’ television show, Good Morning America, in 2016, where the director spoke about his experiences on directing his son in Hacksaw Ridge.The purported news story also claims the Bitcoin Revolution cryptocurrency is “backed by some of the smartest tech minds to ever exist. Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates just to name a few.”Virgin boss Mr Branson and Microsoft founder Mr Gates have publicly said they are not promoting any “get-rich schemes” and have warned people not to fall for scams.“Stories linking me to get-rich-quick opportunities such as binary trading and cryptocurrency schemes often appear on websites via links advertised on various social media sites and paid for ads. These are fake news stories,” Mr Branson said in the statement.Among other fake elements, the purported news article shows a screenshot of a post featuring two young men standing beside a gift-wrapped Ferrari and a claim that a crypto trader bought the sports car for his brother with his profits. The photo is in fact taken from a video produced by hugely successful US YouTube personalities the Dobre Brothers about them buying a Ferrari at “age 19”. There is no link to the use of cryptocurrency. The fake ABC article also claims an “editor” tested out the cryptocurrency trading program.The ABC in Australia warned people about a bitcoin scam masquerading as a news story in April 2019. “The scam ads are tagged as ABC articles, have pictures staged to look like ABC TV screenshots and include quotes under the headline ‘ABC NEWS exclusive’,” the broadcaster said.“These articles are entirely fabricated. We encourage our audience to exercise caution when reading social media advertisements and articles concerning cryptocurrencies which bear the ABC logo.”The photo of the “editor” used in the article – of an Australian flag-waving family at a beach – has appeared multiple times online dating back to 2014, not as an editor but as a promotional image on migration and English language education sites.The article ends with a step-by-step guide on how to “invest” and a large yellow “Register Now” button that links to another page which asks people to sign up with their personal details.Similar Bitcoin scam ads have also featured celebrities such as TV presenter and vet Dr Chris Brown, former NSW premier Mike Baird and Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest.The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued a warning about Bitcoin Revolution in October 2019, calling it a “‘get-rich-quick’ cryptocurrency scam”.Cryptocurrencies, a form of electronic money, have emerged over the past decade and some have risen sharply in value but authorities such as the Australian Securities & Investments Commission have warned that there can be risks involved with trading or investing in them.","https://www.facebook.com/groups/532638380922862/permalink/533531920833508/,http://archive.today/HNkQm,http://archive.is/OEK3e,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/mel_gibson,http://mirrorau.com/gibson/,https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheProjectTV/videos/?ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/TheProjectTV/videos/tonight-pete-sits-down-with-the-stars-of-daddys-home-2-john-lithgow-mel-gibson-w/10155095835158441/,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mel-gibson-directing-son-milo-latest-film-hacksaw/story?id=43211486,https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/watch-out-online-scams,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Reporting-Scams,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SMp_9DBgz4&list=PLVZWgkzt6MXmbQfjbbC88Iq_-GyKBB6tM,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC3OGYxHwV8pB5yLobw9KdA,https://about.abc.net.au/statements/alert-to-fake-news-articles/,https://www.facebook.com/BridgeBlueMongolia/photos/pcb.767588339995516/767586453329038/?type=3&theater,http://archive.today/zyZFU,http://wikivanilla.com/logic/dr_chris_brown_au/?country=Australia&region=New+South+Wales&city=Woronora&campid=10127&offerid=1353&sxid=b9lm6qp9n1kq&key1=Conv&cam,https://lovenex.com/landers/mike/?sxid=b6r84cdmhbod&key1=aus&campaign_id=23843794750640291&adset_name=L&ad_name=Default+name+-+Conversioni&fbclid=IwAR3BLhS8FLEW4k9gM4elRBKDGaWM_H0QyD8E8HyLBTF8ZyxeBIhUdCrH-kc,https://www.fmgl.com.au/in-the-news/media-releases/2019/04/05/statement-on-andrew-forrest-bitcoin-scam,https://www.mfsa.mt/news-item/mfsa-warning-bitcoin-future/,https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/investment-warnings/virtual-currencies","No, Mel Gibson didn’t endorse cryptocurrency scam",,,,,,
283,,,,Partly False,,2019-11-25,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/heart-attack-claims-a-mix-of-facts-and-fiction/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from November 7, 2019 by a user which features a photo of a heart and claims drinking water at specific times of the day will help lower the risk of some diseases. It also details the role of aspirin in heart attacks.  The main claims featured in the post’s caption include, “heart gravity holds water at the bottom of the body and when it is in the vertical position the legs swell. When you lie down, the lower body (legs, etc.. ) are up to the kidneys, and that’s when the kidneys eliminate water because it’s easier.” “Drinking water at one point maximizes its effectiveness in the body, and the right time to drink it is: 2 glasses of water after waking up; helps activate internal organs.1 Glass of water 30 minutes before a meal, helps digestion.1 Glass of water before taking a bath, helps lower blood pressure. 1 Glass of water before going to bed, prevents brain stroke or heart attack.A Facebook post from November 7, 2019 claims drinking water at specific times of the day will help lower the risk of heart attacks and some diseases. “Most heart attacks occur in the day; usually between 6 am and noon. Suffer one at night, when the heart must be at the greatest rest, it means something strange happened.“Because of the attacks on the heart! If that happens, immediately dissolve two aspirin in your mouth and swallow with some water.“There are other symptoms of a heart attack besides chest and left arm pain. An intense pain in the right jaw and / or neck, as well as nausea and a lot of sweating; however, these symptoms may also not occur often. Maybe there is no chest pain during a heart attack.“Most people (about 60 %), who had a heart attack during their sleep were not awake.“Sit on a chair or couch near the front door, wait for your arrival and… eye… don’t lie down!”The post, which has  shared by Australian users, has generated more than 330 shares and attracted more than 20 comments and 60 reactions.The AnalysisClaims linking benefits for drinking water at specific times first appeared in 2004.The aspirin claims first emerged as an email in 2011. Since then, the water and aspirin posts have evolved and made their way onto Facebook. The post’s first claim makes reference to a supposed “heart gravity” which “holds water at the bottom of the body and when it is in the vertical position the legs swell.”  It also claims by laying down that position allows water to flow back up to the kidneys and “that’s when the kidneys eliminate water because it’s easier.”The Heart Foundation Australia confirmed to AAP FactCheck “300mg” of aspirin could play a role in helping “reduce the severity” of a heart attack. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) spokesperson Dr Mark Morgan told AAP FactCheck in an email he had never heard of the “heart gravity” term.  “Water is not held at the bottom of the body but in some people with swollen ankles – a condition called dependant oedema where there is a leakage of watery fluid from blood vessels into surrounding tissues and this is reabsorbed overnight,” he said. The RACGP is the organisation  in Australia that represents urban and rural general practitioners. The post goes on to claim that drinking water at specific times during the day maximises the body’s ability to eliminate toxins, including drinking “2 glasses of water after waking up helps activate internal organs”. Dr Morgan said this claim was completely false. Another claim about water stated, “1 Glass of water 30 minutes before a meal, helps digestion.” Dr Morgan told AAP FactCheck the claim was also false as the body is “designed to be able to digest food whether or not people drink water before a meal”. “Drinking water before a meal can help with weight control by making people feel more full,” he said. In a 2014 University of Washington article on “Water Myths: Debunked”, Dr Michael Rosenfeld, an expert in metabolism said, “if the water that’s consumed has a high level of calcium or magnesium in it, such as ‘hard water’, those minerals may activate certain enzymes that help with fat digestion”. Dr Morgan responded to the claim that drinking a glass of water before taking a bath would help lower blood pressure, saying  “taking a bath when dehydrated can lead to people getting low blood pressure, feeling dizzy and even fainting when they stand up”. “I am not aware of good evidence that overall blood pressure control is benefited by drinking water before a bath, nor can I imagine a mechanism for this to happen,” he said. Professor Garry Jennings, chief medical adviser and cardiologist from Heart Foundation Australia told AAP FactCheck that while adequate water intake is important for good health, “there is no evidence to suggest a glass of water before bed will prevent a cardiovascular event”.“The Heart Foundation urges Australians aged 45 and over, or 30 and over for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples, to see their GP for a Medicare-funded Heart Health Check. This is a much more effective way to avoid a heart attack,” he said in an email. In relation to heart attacks mainly occurring during a specific time of the day, in this case, the post claims between “6am and noon”, Dr Morgan told AAP FactCheck heart attack experiences differ from person to person. “We know strokes and heart attacks can occur any time of day or night,” he said. The post claims “Bayer is making crystal aspirin to instantly dissolve in the language (sic). This one works much faster than the pills.” Bayer is a multinational pharmaceutical company which focuses on healthcare and agriculture. AAP FactCheck was unable to find a Crystal Aspirin product on Bayer’s products page.  According to Bayer’s product details on Amazon, the “Bayer Aspirin Pain Reliever Extra-Strength Quick Release Crystals” product is “Currently unavailable. We don’t know when or if this item will be back in stock.”The Heart Foundation Australia recommends taking aspirin to deal with heart attacks, stating, “Aspirin is used to prevent heart attacks in people who have already had a heart attack, or those who have “coronary heart disease”. The dose is usually 75-150mg daily (“low-dose aspirin”).” A Heart Foundation Australia spokesperson confirmed to AAP FactCheck “300mg” of aspirin could play a role in helping “reduce the severity of the heart attack, reduce complications, and improve survival, regardless of whether a dose has already been taken that day.”“This will work best if the tablets are chewed before swallowing (any form of the tablets can be chewed). Aspirin helps by inhibiting platelets,” the spokesperson said.Although taking a daily low-dose aspirin is not recommended for people who have not had a heart attack or stroke, or those without coronary heart disease, according to the Heart Foundation spokesperson. The post also mentions symptoms related to experiencing a heart attack, including “an intense pain in the right jaw and / or neck, as well as nausea and a lot of sweating”.  According to the Heart Foundation Australia’s Heart Attack Symptoms information page, these are symptoms of a person experiencing a heart attack.According to the post, a person experiencing a heart attack should “sit on a chair or couch near the front door” and “don’t lie down”. The Heart Foundation Australia’s heart attack symptoms page directs people who think they may be experiencing a heart attack to “rest immediately” and does not specify how a person should rest. Dr Morgan said “people should adopt the position that feels most comfortable if conscious”.  “If unconscious then people need to lie down and first aid (including CPR where appropriate) needs to be given,” he said. In the post there are mentions of a “Dr Somers, a cardiologist at the ‘Mayo clinic” who authored a “report of July 29, 2008 in the journal of the American College Of Cardiology”.The Mayo Clinic is an academic medical centre with major campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota in the US.The clinic released a statement on February 28, 2010 refuting the claim about Dr Somers in a page titled, “Misleading Aspirin Email”, stating: “We have been informed of a recently circulated email regarding the use of aspirin, which included mention of Dr Virend Somers and of Mayo Clinic. Neither Dr Somers nor Mayo Clinic contributed to this email, which contains some information that is inaccurate and potentially harmful.” Dr Somers told the St Lewis American newspaper in a February 12, 2014 article: “I have not published any studies on aspirin nor on water. The entire part on aspirin was put together by someone who took the liberty of mischievously attaching our name and our work on sleep apnea to the advice.”","https://www.facebook.com/renee.laymanwollbaum/posts/10156501051271606,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/heart-attacks-and-water/?fbclid=IwAR1BJZGF1NOI71QOJicK7m9Z_OK_jk3QJPbcBcqTsePKRuuWH9y-HgBwiEc,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/heart-attacks-and-water/?fbclid=IwAR1BJZGF1NOI71QOJicK7m9Z_OK_jk3QJPbcBcqTsePKRuuWH9y-HgBwiEc,https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/authors/mark-morgan,https://www.racgp.org.au/the-racgp/about-us/about-the-racgp,https://wholeu.uw.edu/2014/09/17/water/,https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/michael-e-rosenfeld,https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/about-us/our-experts/professor-garry-jennings-ao,https://www.bayer.com/en/profile-and-organization.aspx,https://www.amazon.com/Bayer-Reliever-Extra-Strength-Crystals-20-Count/dp/B002GU79LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8%20https://www.bayeraspirin.com/products/,https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/heart-attack-symptoms?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oegDgC2TOKuO1CqF2PYOtqB9bdYK6h6oQ44aO9ZJDdo7fBPTAriOqg4aArZjEALw_wcB,https://www.mayoclinic.org/?_ga=2.19048440.1189644377.1574390654-967566101.1574128922,https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/misleading-aspirin-email/,https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/somers-virend-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027756,http://www.stlamerican.com/your_health_matters/health_news/i-read-it-online-heart-attacks-water/article_fffc6db0-9407-11e3-98ab-0019bb2963f4.html",Heart attack claims a mix of facts and fiction,,,,,,

Under a caption saying “Don’t leave water in the car!!” is an image of a notice with a headline: “Bottled Water in Your Car Is Very Dangerous”. The notice shows two pictures of bottled water inside a car and reads: “Bottled water in your car is very dangerous! On the Ellen show, Sheryl Crow said that this is what caused her breast cancer. It has been identified as the most common cause of the high levels of dioxin in breast cancer tissue. Sheryl Crow’s oncologist told her: women should not drink bottled that has been left in a car. The heat reacts with the chemicals in the plastic of the bottle which releases dioxin into the water. Dioxin is a toxin increasingly found in breast cancer tissue. So please be careful and do not drink bottled water that has been left in a car.” The US-based group WeAreTeens created their Facebook page in 2012 and describes itself as “an independent business organization centered around keeping our clientele up to date on trending media”. Fiverr, a freelance services platform, lists WeAreTeens as “an independent business organization promoting influencer media”.The post, which has been shared by Australian users, has generated more than 7500 shares and received at least 2500 reactions and 3100 comments. A Facebook post on October 5, 2019 lists a number of claims about bottled water and cancer. The AnalysisThe origins of the bottled water post can be traced back to at least 2004. That year Dr Rolf Halden, then an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences and Center for Water and Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, USA, addressed the claims made in a hoax email linking dioxins and freezing water in plastic bottles.In a Q&A on the Johns Hopkins website, Dr Halden said dioxins are “organic environmental pollutants sometimes referred to as the most toxic compounds made by mankind”. He said a significant source of dioxins are “various combustion processes, including natural events such as wildfires and even volcanic eruptions”.The Cancer Council NSW says there is “no convincing scientific evidence to support the claim that plastic bottles cause cancer”.Dr Halden said freezing acts against the release of chemicals but also said that “there are no dioxins in plastics”. Dr Halden said people are primarily exposed to dioxins mostly from eating meat and fish rich in fat, after fish and animals take up dioxin from the environment and store it in their body fat.“People should be more concerned about the quality of the water they are drinking rather than the container it’s coming from,” he said.Dr Halden said heating of plastic could result in chemicals called phthalates leaching into water or food.“There is another group of chemicals, called phthalates that are sometimes added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle. Phthalates are environmental contaminants that can exhibit hormone-like behavior by acting as endocrine disruptors in humans and animals. If you heat up plastics, you could increase the leaching of phthalates from the containers into water and food,” he said. AAP FactCheck was unable to find evidence of US rock singer Sheryl Crow talking about bottled water and any associated risk on the Ellen talk show. Crow did appear on the US TV show in October, 2008 but did not talk about her breast cancer. Crow did, however, post a warning on her website in September 2006 that said: “Don’t drink water from a bottle that has been sitting in your car. Heated plastic will bleed toxic substances that can be carcinogenic.”The Cancer Council NSW addressed the claims about water in plastic bottles on its website, stating there is “no convincing scientific evidence to support the claim that plastic bottles cause cancer”. The Cancer Council also noted that “it is not clear if plastics used in water bottles contain dioxins and there is no evidence that dioxins are produced when plastics are heated as opposed to burned in an incinerator”.  The Cancer Council stated the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) had found all but one dioxin could not be classified with respect to its cancer risk for humans .One form of dioxin, 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin or TCDD, was identified in 1997 as carcinogenic to humans but the Cancer Council states it does not pose a risk with regard to plastic bottles. The World Health Organization, in a 2016 fact sheet titled ‘Dioxins and their effects of Human Health’ noted that TCDD was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a “known human carcinogen”.  However, TCDD does not affect “genetic material” and that normal exposure to dioxins was “not expected to affect human health on average”.The Cancer Council said the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code states that it is “safe to re-use plastic bottles as long as their condition has not deteriorated and they can be cleaned to avoid health risks associated with bacteria growing in them”.It also said it was “important to note that potential health risks from heating plastics requires temperatures substantially higher than temperatures reached inside a car in the Australian summer.","https://www.facebook.com/WeAreTeensDaily/photos/a.570937092990239/2840157036068222/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/WeAreTeensDaily/about/,https://www.fiverr.com/weareteensdaily?fbclid=IwAR2F3bepgC0FfmRE9DMwqXxq2ze3yUeogF5IDGBwu-dEmQntaEOkbvnhn6M,https://biodesign.asu.edu/rolf-halden,https://www.jhsph.edu/news/stories/2004/halden-dioxins-two.htm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmb7Z9RAgaQ,http://web.archive.org/web/20081206181847/http://www.sherylcrow.com/news/default.aspx?dt=09-01-2006,https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/86097/cancer-information/general-information-cancer-information/cancer-questions-myths/environmental-and-occupational-carcinogens/reused-pet-plastic-drink-bottles-are-not-a-cancer-risk/?fbclid=IwAR0epREPAcL8NpangyFjSo_4DIbGV_UbXxXpfB03visNDaGEwrTXfmRRbq0,http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol69/volume69.pdf,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health,https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/Pages/default.aspx",Bottled water in cars claim leaves a bad taste,,,,,,

Fact checking units Snopes, Full Fact, Politifact and AFP Fact Check have all checked and debunked the claim over the past five years after tracing the text to an essay written by Canadian scientist David Hughes. The essay was part of a collection, edited by Thomas Homer-Dixon, that were published in a 2009 book, Carbon Shift. Mr Homer-Dixon addressed the claims made in the Facebook post in a 2018 blog post, saying the text was “selectively quoted” and “fraudulent”. A particular type of wind turbine will return 32 times more energy than is consumed over the plant’s life cycle in low wind conditions, according to a report. Mr Homer-Dixon wrote that the full excerpt from Dr Hughes’s essay reads: “The concept of net energy must also be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics. A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.”The full quote contends that the “energy payback” of windmills depends on where they’re placed. Mr Homer-Dixon noted it would be “pointless to put wind turbines in poor locations”. Wind power’s energy efficiency has been supported by many studies over the past decade. UNSW renewable energy engineering expert Rob Passey told AAP FactCheck that the post contains misleading information. “This was debunked many, many years ago,” he said.The term “energy payback” can be defined as when a power source, in this case a wind turbine, has generated more energy than the source requires over its life cycle, which runs from construction to disposal.A 2014 study examining the life cycle impact of two-megawatt wind turbines in the United States northwest estimated the “payback time” at five to six months. Another evidence review of 119 wind turbines across 50 sites from 1977 to 2007, published by journal Renewable in 2010, found average “energy payback” was achieved in three to six months. It was estimated the average wind farm produced 20 to 25 times more energy than used over its operational life, with turbines typically designed for 20 years service. A 2017 report by Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas stated (page 16) that a particular type of wind turbine will return 32 times more energy than is consumed over the plant’s life cycle in low wind conditions. Domestically, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency said wind supplied 7.1 per cent of the nation’s total energy demands in 2018 with 94 wind farms generating almost six gigawatts of power.  “This energy type is one of the lowest-cost sources of new electricity supply in Australia, along with utility-scale solar PV,” the government agency wrote in a post on wind energy.","https://www.facebook.com/standupforaustraliamelbourne/photos/a.616013678537177/1528148033990399/?type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wind-idiot-power/,https://fullfact.org/online/wind-turbines-energy/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/apr/12/facebook-posts/no-professor-didnt-say-windmills-will-never-genera/,https://factcheck.afp.com/false-memes-target-wind-turbines,https://www.postcarbon.org/our-people/david-hughes/,https://homerdixon.com/writing/books/carbon-shift-book/,https://homerdixon.com/no-not-say-wind-energy-idiot-power/,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=k8dNQUm7hlIC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=The+concept+of+net+energy+must+also+be+applied+to+renewable+sources+of+energy,+such+as+windmills+and+photovoltaics.+A+two-megawatt+windmill+contains+260+tonnes+of+steel+requiring+170+tonnes+of+coking+coal+and+300+tonnes+of+iron+ore,+all+mined,+transported+and+produced+by+hydrocarbons.+The+question+is:+how+long+must+a+windmill+generate+energy+before+it+creates+more+energy+than+it+took+to+build+it?+At+a+good+wind+site,+the+energy+payback+day+could+be+in+three+years+or+less;+in+a+poor+location,+energy+payback+may+be+never.+That+is,+a+windmill+could+spin+until+it+falls+apart+and+never+generate+as+much+energy+as+was+invested+in+building+it.&source=bl&ots=qfcV9CIKl-&sig=ACfU3U0KRXqZ2iaRB9PERvX_3uf9o1D9kQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQ3_X5q_rlAhWDIbcAHbA_DxYQ6AEwEHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20concept%20of%20net%20energy%20must%20also%20be%20applied%20to%20renewable%20sources%20of%20energy%2C%20such%20as%20windmills%20and%20photovoltaics.%20A%20two-megawatt%20windmill%20contains%20260%20tonnes%20of%20steel%20requiring%20170%20tonnes%20of%20coking%20coal%20and%20300%20tonnes%20of%20iron%20ore%2C%20all%20mined%2C%20transported%20and%20produced%20by%20hydrocarbons.%20The%20question%20is%3A%20how%20long%20must%20a%20windmill%20generate%20energy%20before%20it%20creates%20more%20energy%20than%20it%20took%20to%20build%20it%3F%20At%20a%20good%20wind%20site%2C%20the%20energy%20payback%20day%20could%20be%20in%20three%20years%20or%20less%3B%20in%20a%20poor%20location%2C%20energy%20payback%20may%20be%20never.%20That%20is%2C%20a%20windmill%20could%20spin%20until%20it%20falls%20apart%20and%20never%20generate%20as%20much%20energy%20as%20was%20invested%20in%20building%20it.&f=false,http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/staff/rob-passey,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/full/10.1504/IJSM.2014.062496,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096014810900055X,https://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/about/sustainability/pdfs/v1363%2045mw_mk3a_iso_lca_final_31072017.pdf,https://arena.gov.au/renewable-energy/wind/",Wind turbines produce more energy than it takes to make them,,,,,,

November 12, 2019. The AnalysisAs New South Wales faces catastrophic bushfire conditions, the Fire Brigade Employees’ Union (FBEU) has claimed funding to Fire and Rescue NSW was cut in the last NSW budget.Fire and Rescue NSW (FRNSW) provides fire, rescue and hazmat services across NSW and its professional firefighter members are represented by the FBEU. The FBEU says their members are struggling under budget pressures while “fighting on the frontlines as New South Wales burns” alongside their volunteer counterpart, the Rural Fire Service (RFS).NSW State Secretary for the FBEU, Leighton Drury, told AAP FactCheck, in a story carried in the Northern Daily Leader and numerous other outlets, the state government had “cut $12.9 million to recurrent expenditure” in its last budget. AAP FactCheck examined Mr Drury’s claim that FRNSW’s funding was cut by $12.9 million in the 2019-20 budget.When the FBEU claim was put to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on the ABC’s RN Breakfast radio program on November 12, she rejected it as “completely incorrect and wrong”.The premier said the government had “provided record number (sic) of both capital and recurrent funding” to “all our frontline agencies and emergency services”.Mr Drury referred AAP FactCheck to the 2019-20 NSW Budget Estimates paper. Budget papers show funding for agencies in two parts: recurrent expenses for items such as wages, and capital expenditure for items such as buildings and equipment. The 2019/20 budget shows FRNSW received $774.3 million for expenses and $51.9 million for capital expenditure. It also shows revised 2018/19 expenses funding – the result of the mid-year review regularly done halfway through each budget period – was $787.2 million, while revised 2018/19 capital expenditure was $80.4 million. This means that FRNSW’s 2019/20 recurrent expenses budget is indeed $12.9 million lower than what it received in 2018/18 as a result of increased funds at mid-year.However, in the original 2018/19 budget, handed down in June 2018, FRNSW funding for expenses was $729 million. An extra $58.2 million was allocated at the mid-year review. Based on the original 2018/19 budget, FRNSW was allocated $45.3 million more in funding in the 2019/20 budget.The extra $58.2 million allocated at mid-year follows the state government passing a law in 2018 to make it easier for firefighters to claim compensation for cancers caused by their work. While money was allocated for retrospective claims, AAP FactCheck was unable to clarify whether the entire additional allocation was to fund compensation claims.A NSW government spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that FRNSW “will be receiving a record $826 million in 2019-20, an increase of 2.7 per cent from funding announced in the 2018-19 budget”.The $826 million comes from adding $774.3 million allocated to the FRNSW’s recurrent expenses and $51.9 million for capital expenditure.The different positions of the FBEU, which claims there has been a cut to FRNSW’s budget, and the NSW government, which claims the budget has risen to a record level, depend on whether the 2019/20 budget is compared to the original 2018/19 accounts, or the revised version done mid-year.AAP FactCheck contacted several economists to seek opinion on whether the funding amounted to a cut.AMP chief economist, Shane Oliver told AAP FactCheck it is customary to use “whatever is close as possible to whatever is spent and then whatever is planned for the current financial year”.“For last year, 2018-19 you have really got to take what was actually spent which is the revised number. You’ve got to compare what they’re budgeting this year compared to what they actually spent last year,” Dr Oliver said.Dr Oliver’s position supports that of the FBEU, however the AMP economist also said the costs for cancer compensation would have to be excluded from calculations if they were a one-off.“It would be wrong to have a look at the 2019-20 budget and say it’s down on the finalised or revised number for 2018-19 because that 2018-19 number was what turns out to be exaggerated by that one-off payment,” he said.Frank Stilwell, a professor emeritus in political economy at the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck via email that a spending cut “is the amount by which the funding allocated for the year ahead has been reduced below the actual expenditure in the preceding year”.“That is what would normally be understood as a ‘cut’,” Prof Stilwell said.Prof Stilwell said whether the budget for any one year was affected by a particular variable, such as workers’ compensation payments, “may indeed affect the outcome”.“Next year could be affected by other cost blow-outs too, which could adversely affect employment and services if the spending allocation is strictly adhered to,” he said.Dr Phillip Toner, Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Political Economy at the University of Sydney told AAP FactCheck in an email that the opposing claims “may be a classic case of ‘damned lies and statistics’ in that both sides may be using published data that suits their particular causes”.“It may be difficult to say whose view is ‘correct’ or whose interpretation should be given more weight,” he said.Separate to the debate about the different budget figures, the FBEU has also argued that the NSW Government’s Labour Expense Cap – a 2.5 per cent annual limit on employment costs imposed on many agencies in 2013 – is also an effective cut to its budget as any costs above the cap must be met from within the existing budget.Mr Drury argues that the Labor Expense Cap requires $21 million in savings to be found and claims it is “crippling FRNSW”.Trish Doyle, the NSW Labor opposition’s emergency services spokeswoman, has said firefighters “must find more than $20 million a year to cut from their already lean budgets” under the cap, which they were not exempt from, unlike teachers, police and nurses.Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck has concluded the claim that $12.9 million has been cut from the FRNSW recurrent budget is ambiguous. A comparison shows the Fire and Rescue NSW expenses budget for 2019/20 is indeed $12.9 million less than the eventual amount that was allocated in 2018/19. However, it is also correct that the budget for 2019/20 did have more recurrent funding allocated to FRNSW than the budget for 2018/19.Economists consulted by AAP FactCheck have stated that the higher actual funding in 2018/19 does indicate an effective cut in the 2019/20 budget, but have added a caveat that any funding that should be considered one-off complicates the issue.

TODAY ONLY”. The link, and a similar version, have been shared more than 170 times by users in Australia. A link shared on Facebook on November 13, 2019 features a a purported offer of a free $75 Costco coupon in celebration of the company’s anniversary. The AnalysisThe initial Costco $75 coupon post began circulating on Facebook on November 12, according to a Business Insider Australia report.The post urges Facebook users to share the link and they will receive a voucher in return.In response Costco said on its Facebook page that the coupon offer was a scam. “Despite several posts out there, Costco is NOT giving away $75 coupons. While we love our fans and our members, this offer is a SCAM and in no way affiliated with Costco. Thanks to our fans for letting us know about this recurring hoax.”  US wholesale company Costco described the $75 coupon offer on Facebook as a scam.A Costco spokesperson told US media outlet ABC News that “Costco never sends coupon offers on social media”. The company shares legitimate deals on its website and doesn’t accept any coupons that are not issued by Costco, according to CNN Business. Evidence of this can be found on the wholesale retailer’s Australian website under its coupons page. The coupon post, which claimed to be only available in Canada and the US, was called out by Facebook groups in Australia. On November 13, the Costco Casula (Fan Page), in Sydney’s southwest, posted the coupon image with the word ‘Scam’ written across it and warned: “If you see this, don’t share it, it’s a SCAM”.CNN Business and fact checker Snopes reported that Costco was the subject of a similar coupon ruse in November 2018 under the pretence it was the company’s 50th anniversary. Snopes explained that web pages such as the coupon offer “typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook “share” buttons and post comments to the scammer’s site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends)”. “Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two “Reward Offers” (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards).”","https://www.facebook.com/Kontji/photos/a.1421584031493244/2410685785916392/?type=3&theater,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/costco-75-dollar-coupon-not-real-2019-11,https://www.facebook.com/Costco/posts/10158173746384947,https://abcnews.go.com/US/viral-costco-coupon-good-true/story?id=66970796,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/business/costco-coupon-scam-trnd/index.html,https://www.costco.com.au/coupons,https://www.facebook.com/257139844323968/photos/a.620530231318259/2520599434644653/?type=3&theater,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/business/costco-coupon-scam-trnd/index.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/costco-coupon-scam/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/costco-coupon-scam/",Costco $75 coupon post is a scam,,,,,,

The link goes to a web page featuring a video announcing the supposed death of Hollywood film star Clint Eastwood. The video features a photo of Eastwood next to a candle flame and the words “Rest in peace 1930-2019” above the logo for US TV news network CNN. Clicking play on the video opens to a short video featuring images of Eastwood with a headline “The Actor and Filmmaker Died of Heart Attack While Directing A Movie About His Life” and a CNN Breaking News strapline, which says “1 hr ago”. The video then stops to display the message “Warning: This video may show graphic content (18+) Share to continue watching” above a tab which reads “Uncover Now”.The link, and a near-identical version, have been shared more than 140 times by users in Australia. A link shared on Facebook on November 7, 2019 features a video announcing the supposed death of Hollywood film star Clint Eastwood. The AnalysisClint Eastwood is not dead but it isn’t the first time the Hollywood actor and director has been the subject of hoax death stories on social media and the internet. In May 2017, the US Leader website reported that Eastwood had been found dead in his Brentwood, California home. Fact checkers Snopes revealed the article stated that “the Orange County Sheriff” confirmed Eastwood’s death but Brentwood is in Los Angeles County, not Orange County.In June 2017, a website designed to look like a CNN report published an article titled “Hollywood Icon And Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood Has Passed Away Age 87”. Hollywood actor and director Clint Eastwood has been the subject of several hoax death stories on social media.The US-based news website Inquisitr said the website www.cnn-globalnews.com – which is not the site of US cable news giant CNN – published the report on June 18 that year, claiming Eastwood died of a heart attack.Truth or Fiction website reported the domain for cnn-globalnews.com was registered to an owner in Singapore on June 6, 2017, just weeks before the Eastwood hoax went viral. “That would seem to indicate that the Clint Eastwood death hoax was a (successful) attempt to drive up the new website’s domain authority in search engine ranking algorithms using a classic clickbait celebrity death hoax,” Truth or Fiction reasoned. Another Eastwood death hoax circulated in August 2019. Snopes reported that similar to the 2017 story a video appearing to show a CNN news report claiming that Eastwood “had died at the age of 89 while filming a television commercial”. The November 7, 2019 story, investigated by AAP FactCheck was similar. Once again the post displayed a CNN logo and featured a video with the headline “The Actor and Filmmaker Died of Heart Attack While Directing A Movie About His Life”.UK newspaper The Independent compiled a report in September 2019 titled, ‘Clint Eastwood death hoax: Why the internet keeps saying celebrities are dead when they are not’. In its analysis the newspaper said the reason why there are so many death hoaxes is that people “want people want to read them” and that like “many other things on the internet, it’s about engaging people”. Eastwood is filming a new movie, Richard Jewell, about a security guard who became a suspect in a pipe bombing during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

The AnalysisThe Facebook post claiming that Japan “keeps Islam at bay” by enforcing strict laws on Muslims dates back to 2015. US-based fact check unit Snopes found in November 2015 that the majority of the claims made were either false or misleading. In the same year US-based PolitiFact also investigated the post and concluded that “the overall point of the graphic – that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims – is dramatically off base”. News agency AFP fact checked a similar claim in 2019 that Japan and Poland had experienced no terror attacks because of a “permanent ban on Muslim migrants.” AFP found the claim false, and said “thousands of Muslims live in both countries and terror attacks have been recorded in the past”. AAP FactCheck found there was no evidence to support the claim that “Muslims cannot even rent a house” in Japan.AAP FactCheck examined each of the 10 points made in the post and also sought comment from the Consulate-General Japan but received no reply at the time of publication. Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims      In 2013, Becoming Legally Japanese, a website dedicated to citizenship information, addressed the citizenship claim and found it to be false. The website said immigration was not restricted based on religion and highlighted Article 14 of the Constitution of Japan which says: “All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin”. Permanent residency is not given to MuslimsImmigration Services Agency of Japan makes no mention of religion in their “Guidelines for Permission for Permanent Residence.”Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned     AAP FactCheck was unable to find evidence to support or disprove the claim, however a recent peer-reviewed academic journal article titled Perceptions of Islam and Muslims in Contemporary Japan by Atsushi Yamagata of the University of Wollongong, looked into the rising number of Muslim tourists and permanent residents. The scholar argues there is little evidence to indicate increasing negative attitudes towards Muslims, and contends “the rise of national pride in Japanese hospitality has encouraged Japanese people to be more welcoming to Muslims”. In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taughtThe International University of Japan does not teach Arabic or Islamic languages. However, a number of institutions in Japan offer Arabic courses, including the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. There are also a number of private Arabic language schools, teachers and tutors in Japan. Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countriesAccording to the Macquarie Dictionary, negligible means “so small that it may be neglected, or disregarded; very little”.  Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists a number of its embassies in countries with large or majority Muslim populations, including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen.One cannot import the ‘Koran’ published in the Arabic language     There is no reference to this claim in the Constitution of Japan. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo told PolitiFact that “the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported”. The Koran in Arabic can be purchased on Amazon Japan. Muslims must follow Japanese law and languageThis claim is true as it is in other countries. The Constitution of Japan states that “laws of political morality are universal; and that obedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would sustain their own sovereignty”. Regarding language requirements, the Tokyoimmigration service website advises that to become a Japanese national an applicant should have “Japanese reading and writing skills at least equivalent to an ordinary 7 to 8 year old Japanese primary school student. You need to understand basic “kanji(漢字)” besides “katakana(カタカナ)” and “hiragana(ひらがな)”. You need to be able to have smooth Japanese oral communication with an officer in charge of your case”. However another site, Becoming Legally Japanese, said it is true “there is an informal written test that the local (immigration Bureau of Japan) sometimes administers which tests this. However, there is no formal requirement in the rules. The Japanese language “requirement” actually is part of the “Livelihood” requirement: if you can’t read, write, and speak at least at a rudimentary level, the odds of you falling on hard times (poverty and welfare) because you’re unemployable are much higher”.  The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim lawsAAP FactCheck was unable to find evidence to support or disprove this claim, however it contrasts with a statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during an address to Islamic Diplomatic Corps in July 2014. Abe said: “I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others. I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence. The Japanese people sincerely hope for peace and prosperity in the Middle East.” Muslims cannot even rent a house in JapanThere is no law preventing Muslims from renting a house. Any foreigner seeking to rent a house in Japan may encounter obstacles, according to culture and travel website, Japan Talk. The website lists four main challenges for renting: finding a guarantor; few real estate agents accept clients who don’t speak Japanese; rental costs and discrimination by owners and agents.There is no sharia law in JapanThis is correct. Article 20 of the Constitution of Japan states: “Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority. No person shall be compelled to take part in any religious act, celebration, rite or practice. The State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity.”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=975614995833243&set=a.120930841301667&type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/muslims-in-japan/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/17/viral-image/viral-graphic-says-japan-keeps-out-radical-islam-t/,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-muslims-are-not-banned-poland-and-japan,https://www.turning-japanese.info/2013/10/can-muslims-acquire-japanese.html,https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html,http://www.moj.go.jp/content/001241940.pdf,https://newvoices.org.au/volume-11/perceptions-of-islam-and-muslims-in-contemporary-japan/,https://ro.uow.edu.au/lhapapers/3923/,https://www.iuj.ac.jp/,http://www.aii-t.org/e/,https://www.findmyfavouriteteacher.com/students-searchresult.php?mode=search&language=Arabic&world=Asia_and_Pacific&country=104&country2=Japan&state=Any,https://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/mofaserv.html,http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng/faculty/prof/kamada.html,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/17/viral-image/viral-graphic-says-japan-keeps-out-radical-islam-t/,https://www.amazon.co.jp/Holy-Quran-English-Translation-Commentary/dp/0913321052/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&keywords=Qur%27an+arabic&qid=1573527773&sr=8-1,https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html,https://www.tokyoimmigration.jp/?p=178,https://www.turning-japanese.info/2012/03/misinformation-tokyo-immigration.html,https://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/actions/201407/16article2.html,https://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/why-its-difficult-to-get-an-apartment-in-Japan,https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html",‘Japan keeps Islam at bay’ post is partly false,,,,,,

Before we continue, we need to apologise. We are sorry, but the story above is not real (if you hadn’t already realised).The original image was taken by Duke University researcher, Will Cook in Durham, North Carolina on September 23, 2007.  “We needed to get your attention because we want to help you, we are a company offering technology repairs and other services. Some of the most common issues we encounter are “Slow PC’s”, you’re probably familiar with this yourself,” the article explained. The post also credited The Daily Carrier, a travel blog, for its “initial post on Flying Spiders” from April 2013.The original image was taken by Duke University researcher, Will Cook in Durham, North Carolina on September 23, 2007. The photo was of a Dolomedes sp., otherwise known as a ‘Fishing Spider’ eating a cockroach before the wings were photoshopped.Dolomedes spiders, also known as Fishing Spiders, are water spiders, which can “walk on water due to the hairs on their legs”, according to the Museums Victoria website. The spiders can also dive and swim underwater to catch prey, including invertebrates and fish. Fishing spiders can be found in south-western, northern and eastern Australia on the mainland and Tasmania in swamps and lakes. Although they are not venomous, they are aggressive and can bite in self defence. Ecologist and Associate Professor Dieter Hochuli from the University of Sydney told AAP FactCheck scientists have not discovered a spider with wings.  “They don’t have the body plan to support it,” he said in an email.Dr Hochuli said while there were no flying spiders, there are spiders which could perform “ballooning on threads of gossamer” where they release threads of silk into the wind which carries them through the air.“They can disperse enormous distances on these very fine strands that they spin out and the move using whatever winds and air currents are there,” he said. “There are amazing stories of them travelling hundreds of kilometres, or being caught five kilometres up in the air.”","https://www.facebook.com/TumblrMadeMeDoIt/photos/a.354496907995569/2519626411482597/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/TumblrMadeMeDoIt/,https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=winged%20spider,https://web.archive.org/web/20140315003347/http://www.digitalplumbinguk.com/uncategorized/early-summer-threatens-uk-volat-araneus-flying-spider,https://web.archive.org/web/20140315003347/http://www.digitalplumbinguk.com/uncategorized/early-summer-threatens-uk-volat-araneus-flying-spider,https://web.archive.org/web/20140220060057/http://www.thedailycarrier.com/2013/04/scientists-discover-flying-spider.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20101023001912/http://carolinanature.com/spiders/bigspider00982.jpg,https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/staff/cook,https://web.archive.org/web/20101016010005/http://www.carolinanature.com/spiders/,https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/species/8804,https://sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/dieter-hochuli.html,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/spider-silk-ballooning-flying-animals-spd/",Winged spider ‘discovery’ claim doesn’t fly,,,,,,

Other less common foodborne illness occurs from accidental chemical poisoning and natural contaminants.Accredited practising dietitian Simone Austin of the Dietitians Association of Australia told AAP FactCheck she had never come across any evidence to substantiate the claim about onions. “I haven’t seen any research to see why that would be true,” Ms Austin told AAP FactCheck. “Particularly because of the fact that onions have very little protein, and most often foods that are going to develop bacteria are often due to protein in the food.”She said dirt should be removed to prevent any contamination or listeriosis and to chop onions on a clean board. A dietitian from the Dietitians Association of Australia told AAP FactCheck she had never come across any evidence to substantiate the claim about onions. “Make sure you are not cutting an onion on the same board as your raw poultry or raw meat, there is possible cross-contamination there,” Ms Austin said. Once chopped, Ms Austin advised onions should be stored correctly in a container so no moisture can cause mould issues.US fact checking unit Snopes traced the initial onions claim back to March 2008. Snopes looked into the claim and found it was false as did another US-based site PolitiFact in 2019 and Queensland-based fact check site Hoax-Slayer in 2017. In 2018, the National Onion Association’s Rene Hardwick sent a letter to concerned customers addressing both chain email messages and social media marketing claiming “cut onions can cure the flu, are magnets for bacteria, and are responsible for food poisoning”. The letter stated that all claims were unsubstantiated, and that “when handled properly, cut onions can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to seven days”.","https://www.facebook.com/288850217931239/photos/a.288864981263096/553802901435968/?type=3&theater,http://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/science/science-in-focus/foodborne-illness-pathogens,https://daa.asn.au/voice-of-daa/daa-spokespeople/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cut-onions-contamination/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/aug/16/facebook-posts/no-pre-chopped-onions-are-not-poisonous-next-day-o/,https://www.hoax-slayer.net/false-claim-onions-magnets-bacteria/?fbclid=IwAR1M_Pp8RtXnGIHOqbc5bQMpQp3oFDF-ChUHpAN_dG8MmxV_iHZIhcU2ik4,https://www.onions-usa.org/img/site_specific/uploads/Cut_Onion_Statement_rev_1_2018.pdf",Onions don’t become ‘highly poisonous’ if cut the day before cooking,,,,,,

Those who entered parliament before October 9, 2004 get access to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme (PCSS) after they retire. The Department of Finance told AAP FactCheck the post’s claim politicians receive their salaries “for life” is untrue.The PCSS was introduced in 1948 and pays retired politicians, who were elected to parliament before October 9, 2004, a retirement income based on the number of years they have served in parliament – a percentage from 80 per cent of an MP’s base salary (Remuneration Tribunal (Members of Parliament) Determination 2019 Compilation No.1, page 3) . If a politician has served in other ministerial roles during their tenure, 6.25 per cent of 80 per cent of the salary for that role is included for every additional role the politician held. The extra money from ministerial roles is capped at 75 per cent of the highest paid additional role the politician held. A Department of Finance spokesperson told AAP FactCheck politicians who “entered the parliament after 9 October 2004, which constitutes more than 90 per cent of federal parliamentarians, are not entitled to a pension on retirement”. For those who are eligible, the pension varies from politician to politician and the base salary is revised every year by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal is an “independent statutory authority established under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973” with a purpose to “determine, report on or provide advice about remuneration, including allowances and entitlements” for federal Parliamentarians, judicial and non-judicial offices of federal courts and tribunals Secretaries of Departments, full-time and part-time holders of various public offices and Principal Executive Offices. Currently, all living retired Australian prime ministers have access to the PCSS pension system. The PCSS was closed to new members after October 9, 2004. Politicians who enter parliament after that time are subject to the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004 which sees 15.4 per cent of their salary contributed to a super fund. The Finance Department spokesperson told AAP FactCheck federal politicians who entered parliament following the changes in 2004 are “members of superannuation schemes that are common throughout the community.”“Under these schemes, the superannuation benefit is payable as a lump sum, consisting of accumulated contributions and earnings,” the spokesperson said. “Access to these benefits is subject to the same conditions that apply to the broader community.”The post quotes incorrect figures for retired Australian prime ministers and federal politicians. Based on a Remuneration Tribunal determination that came into force on 1 July, a retired prime minister could potentially earn up to $328,162 for life, while an ex-MP would be entitled to a minimum pension of $125,362. Some politicians who entered federal parliament before October 9, 2004 would receive more than the minimum if they served as ministers or as other office-holders.For example Julie Bishop, Christopher Pyne and Nigel Scullion will receive at least $188,000 a year for the rest of their life, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Steve Ciobo, 44, who was elected to federal parliament in 2001, would also be eligible for a pension but can only begin receiving payment when he turns 55. This is due to changes made by the Howard government where those elected between November 10, 2001 to October 9, 2004 would become eligible once they turn 55. In 2013, the year of the post examined by AAP FactCheck, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate president each received a salary of $341,477.50 from a base salary of $195,130 with an additional 75 per cent of that base salary for those positions added on. In 2019, both positions received a salary of $369,687.50 from a base salary of $211,250 and the 75 per cent addition for the role. The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate do not stay on the salaries for those positions “for life”. Once they retire, they move onto the retirement scheme based on when they were elected to parliament.Unlike the US political system, the Australian system does not have an equivalent role for a Majority and Minority leader in parliament. The most comparable role in the Australian parliament for a majority leader is the prime minister, the leader of a party who controls more than half of the seats in the House of Representatives and, therefore, forms government.In 2013, the prime minister of Australia had a salary of $507,338 from a base salary of $195,130 with an additional 160 per cent added on. In 2019, the prime minister earns a salary of $549,250 from a base salary of $211,250 with a 160 per cent of that base added on. The Leader of the Opposition earns, as of 2019, $390,812.5 a year from a base salary of 211,250 and an additional 85 per cent for holding the position of leader of the opposition, compared to $360,990 in 2013.The Department of Finance lists the Leader of a Minority Party under two definitions: with more than 10 members in parliament and with up to 10 members in parliament. The second definition may refer to leaders of minor parties, such as The Australian Greens or One Nation, who have fewer than 10 elected members in parliament and earned a salary of $301,031 in 2019 – an additional 42.5 per cent on top of the base salary. In 2013, leaders of minor parties who had more than five members of parliament but fewer than 10 earned $278,060.25.  The leaders of these minor parties do not, however, stay on this salary for life and revert to superannuation schemes when they retire. The amount their receive will vary based on when they were elected to parliament and how long they served in parliament. The Department of Finance told AAP FactCheck the post’s claim that the listed politicians receive their salaries “for life” is untrue. Australian soldiers currently serving in the Australian Defence Force can earn between $48,990 and $55,762 on completion of military and employment training. The age to receive the aged pension is increasing from 65 to 67 over eight years. From July 1, 2019, people are able to start receiving a pension once they turn 66 and are eligible for the pension if they earn less than $2040.80 a fortnight.  Pensioners must satisfy the income and assets tests to start receiving the aged pension. Based on the income test, those who earn more than $174 per fortnight will have their pension reduced by 50 cents for every dollar over $174. If they receive an income of $2040.80, they will no longer receive a pension payment. Based on the assets test, the pension rate begins to reduce if a pensioner owns assets worth more than $263,250 for a single person who is a home owner. A single person and homeowner receiving a part pension stops receiving the payment once their assets are worth more than $574,500. A single pensioner on a full aged pension income would receive $933.40 a fortnight, from a maximum basic rate of $850.40, $68.90 pension supplement and a $14.10 energy supplement. Single pensioners on the full pension would receive $22,401.60 a year. However, pensioners could get a part pension based on their retirement savings which could reduce the amount of pension money they receive based on the income test and/or assets test.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201198771883089&set=a.1884993656277&type=3&theater,https://www.finance.gov.au/government/superannuation/parliamentary-superannuation/parliamentary-contributory-superannuation-act-1948-parliamentary-contributory-superannuation-scheme-pcss,https://www.remtribunal.gov.au/document-library-search,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00081,https://www.remtribunal.gov.au/about-us,http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/,https://www.finance.gov.au/government/superannuation/parliamentary-superannuation/overview-parliamentary-superannuation-act-2004,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00859,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/taxpayers-face-bill-of-up-to-1b-to-fund-mps-retirements-20190308-p512nk.html,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=00AN0,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2014C00462,https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Majority_Minority_Leaders.htm,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2014C00462,https://maps.finance.gov.au/Guidance/Remuneration/Salary,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/The_(official)_Opposition,https://maps.finance.gov.au/Guidance/Remuneration/Salary,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2014C00462,https://army.defencejobs.gov.au/lifestyle-and-benefits/pay-and-allowances,https://www.dss.gov.au/seniors/benefits-payments/age-pension,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/wife-pension/who-can-get-it/income-test-pensions,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/age-pension/how-much-you-can-get/assets-test/assets#assetstestlimits,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/age-pension/how-much-you-can-get,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/wife-pension/who-can-get-it/income-test-pensions",Politicians salaries vary and are not for life,,,,,,

So once you put it on someone’s head you can have them shower and rinse it off right away and all the lice will be killed and gone.” The text is underneath an image of a young girl having her brushed with a comb. The post has been shared more than 21,000 times and has attracted more than 290 reactions and five comments. The AnalysisNSW Health lists head louse as a “parasitic insect that can be found on the head, eyebrows and eyelashes of people. Head lice feed on human blood several times a day and lives close to the human scalp, but are not known to spread disease”. NSW Health recommends two treatments options: * mechanical removal using a lice comb and conditioner.* chemical removal using a lice comb and chemical treatment containing synthetic or natural insecticides that kill head lice (talk to your local pharmacist to identify the treatments containing insecticides). For treating lice, NSW Health recommends removal by using a lice comb and conditioner.In 2018 US news website WUSA investigated the Facebook post and found the claim was false. Scientists at the University of California found no evidence home remedies worked to “kill, control or suffocate” lice. Associate Professor in Biology at the University of South Australia Craig Williams, told AAP FactCheck the remedy listed in the post was not proven as an effective treatment but coconut oil had some mild benefits by repelling head lice. “I wouldn’t put it in the effective basket, it’s definitely not as good as other treatment options, however some research papers have found lice don’t like coconut oil.“I’ve done my own research and seen some lice walk away from the hair shafts that is coated in coconut oil, so there are some mild effects, but there are a number of better treatments people should go to initially.”Prof Williams said there was no published evidence to support apple cider vinegar as a treatment against lice.He told AAP FactCheck he had never come across a product that “dissolves lices outer skeletal shell”, nor one that claimed it could guarantee all lice would be killed upon contact. “Some of the naturally-derived treatment options you can buy actually perform the best, tea-tree oil is a bit of a gold standard.”University of Sydney’s clinical lecturer and medical entomologist Cameron Webb said lice eggs are resilient and recommended that home remedies be applied with caution in case of irritating the scalp or skin. “In terms of treating head lice nothing is considered really effective when getting rid of eggs,”  Dr Webb told AAP FactCheck. “Eggs get attached by almost a superglue-like substance by the louse, and this becomes incredibly difficult to dislodge. There seems to be an endless stream of urban myths about what works and what doesn’t, this claim is a step too far.”Dr Webb said registered nit treatments come under the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which meet certain standards. Both experts said the safest and most effective treatments for head lice were in line with the NSW Health guidelines.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2382694328414146&set=gm.2144997265519519&type=3&theater,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/headlice/Pages/default.aspx,https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/headlice/Pages/treatment.aspx,https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/verify/verify-does-coconut-oil-vinegar-treat-head-lice/65-9d66a253-b8b5-4b43-9656-9e5febfe9e70,https://people.unisa.edu.au/craig.williams,https://sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/cameron-webb.html",Coconut oil and apple cider vinegar are not proven remedies for lice,,,,,,
296,,,,Mostly True,,2019-11-06,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/has-the-level-of-casual-employment-in-the-australian-workforce-not-changed-for-two-decades/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“The claim that the workforce is now excessively casualised is simply not true. The level of casualisation hasn’t changed for about 20 years.”Jennifer Westacott, Business Council of Australia chief executive. October 31, 2019. The AnalysisBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says trade unions have an important role but has taken issue with what she calls “overstatements” of trends in Australia’s workforce composition.In a speech at Melbourne’s La Trobe University on October 31, Ms Westacott targeted the focus of unions on levels of casual work in Australia, saying: “The claim that the workforce is now excessively casualised is simply not true”. “The level of casualisation hasn’t changed for about 20 years,” she said. AAP FactCheck examined the claim that there has been no change in the level of casual work in Australia for approximately two decades.Ms Westacott made the claim as part of a speech titled, “Do trade unions help or harm Australia’s economy”. The speech outlined the BCA’s vision for the roles unions and business must play to improve Australia’s economy and strengthen support for the most vulnerable in society. Ms Westacott described herself as a supporter of unions and the role unions have in ensuring the wellbeing of society. While she took issue with what she described as “a short term campaigning focus” by unions and “the risk of overstatements of important trends”, Ms Westacott said there were important issues concerning underemployment, the so-called gig economy, and the rise of part-time work. [2]Casualisation and “insecure work” are contested issues in Australia, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) claiming in 2018 that insecure work is rising and is “the biggest issue facing Australian workers”. At the time of publication the ACTU were unable to provide AAP FactCheck with a definition of “insecure work.” However in 2012 the ACTU commissioned an independent inquiry into insecure work, which was defined as “that which provides workers with little social and economic security, and little control over their working lives.” Indicators of this included unpredictable, fluctuating pay; irregular and unpredictable working hours and inferior rights and entitlements.The Australian Bureau of Statistics says “one of the main indicators for casual employment is whether an employee is entitled to paid leave, such as paid sick leave or paid annual leave”.Ms Westacott’s statement is supported by a January 2018 Parliamentary Library report, which states that from 1996 to 2016, the casual employee share of total employees increased “marginally” from 24 per cent to 25 per cent. The same report notes that “use of casual employees in Australia grew most strongly from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s”, increasing from around 13 per cent to 24 per cent.A December 2018 Parliamentary Library report, by the same author, states that casual employees comprised 25.1 per cent of total employees in August 2017 and 24.6 per cent in August 2018.The report states: “Claims have been made by some economic commentators and unions about the growing casualisation of the workforce and disproportionate growth in non-traditional or non-standard forms of employment. These claims are not supported by the latest data. While there have been periods where growth in casual employment has been stronger or weaker than permanent employment over the past 14 years, the casual share of employees and employment has not changed substantially in this time. In fact, over the whole period analysed, growth in the number of permanent employees has been stronger than growth in casual employees.”In July 2018 the ABC examined a similar statement by the then workplace minister Craig Laundy. Mr Laundy said casuals had remained at a steady 25 per cent over the last 20 years and the ABC found the claim checked out, but noted it “relied on a narrow definition of insecure work”.In 2016 The Conversation probed the Australian Industry Group who said the percentage of casuals employed in Australia had not changed since 1998 and found ABS data to confirm Ai Group’s statement. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said in a statement to AAP FactCheck that casualisation was only one of many non-standard forms of work “which by some estimates accounts for half of the total workforce in Australia”.“While the percentage of employees who are engaged as casuals is similar today to what it was 20 years ago (20.6 per cent now compared to 20.1 per cent in 1998, that percentage has risen significantly in the past 10 years when it jumped from 19 per cent to today’s levels). The real story here is the growth in numbers where casual employees have jumped from 2.2 million in 2008 to 2.6 million in 2018,” she said.Ms McManus referenced ABS figures in the December 2018 parliamentary report on trends in non-standard forms of employment and cited the change in casual share of employment.“Added to the number of workers on casual employment contracts are the number of workers on fixed-term contracts or forced into independent contractor status. These workers are not counted in the BCA’s number but they include most ‘gig’ economy workers.”Senior Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne Dr Josh Healy told AAP FactCheck that, in official statistical terms, the proportion of casual employment in Australia sits at about a quarter of the workforce and has done so for many years.Dr Healy said when viewing the situation through a wider lens, the bigger issue was about the idea of insecure employment, and the fact that casual employment figures remained about 25 per cent was still problematic. “The fact that proportion is stable is nothing to boast about, it represents a very large chunk of the workforce,” he said.Dr Healy pointed to the fact the ABS classifies a casual worker as an employee while a gig economy worker is considered a contractor, putting them in a separate data set to casual workers.Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found Ms Westacott’s statement that the level of casualisation in the workforce has not changed for about 20 years is true – a parliamentary library report using ABS data supports her statement. However the ACTU claims the definition of casual work is too narrow and excludes fixed-term workers and independent contractors. Ms Westacott also acknowledged there are “important issues concerning underemployment, the so-called gig economy, and the rise of part time work”.","https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/business-leader-s-surprise-admission-about-the-role-of-unions-20191030-p535uy.html,https://www.bca.com.au/ennifer_westacott_do_trade_unions_help_or_harm_australia_s_economy,https://www.actu.org.au/actu-media/media-releases/2018/australia-leading-the-world-in-creating-insecure-work,https://www.actu.org.au/media/349417/lives_on_hold.pdf,https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6333.0,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/5742396/upload_binary/5742396.pdf,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1819/NonStandardEmployment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-17/fact-check-casualisation/9654334,https://theconversation.com/factcheck-has-the-level-of-casual-employment-in-australia-stayed-steady-for-the-past-18-years-56212,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1819/NonStandardEmployment",Has the level of casual employment in the Australian workforce not changed for two decades?,,,,,,

The car’s glass too are kept easily breakable from inside. Very few people know about it and thus can’t save themselves in case of emergencies. Please share it with as many possible (sic) and educate.”The post, which features a photo of a headrest inside a car, has been shared more than 56,000 times and has attracted 36 reactions and two comments. The AnalysisHead restraints are a regulatory requirement under Australian Design Rules for vehicle standards. The claim about headrest design being to aid glass-breaking was circulated on Facebook in April 2016, with US fact checking organisation Snopes examining it and finding that “car headrests were not designed to serve this function”.Experts say car glass is not designed to be broken easily and can be harder to break if laminated or tinted.Snopes traces the claim back to a 2012 Japanese game show which features a woman using a headrest to break a driver’s window from inside a car by wedging it between the glass and the window sill .According to the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP Safety), the purpose of the head restraint is to prevent hyper-extension of the neck in a crash, with newer designs optimised to reduce the risk of whiplash injuries in rear-end crashes. Regarding the design of automotive glass, an ANCAP Safety spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that in the United States, it is now “effectively mandatory for vehicles to have laminated glass to prevent ejection in crashes – meaning the glass can’t be broken as a means of egress”.However this standard has not yet been adopted in Australia. A spokesperson for motoring organisation the NRMA told AAP FactCheck that headrests were not designed to be able to break the glass from inside a car.“Car headrests are too difficult to hold onto, you’d need to get a good swing on them and a headrest is going to fall out of your hands so they’re not designed for that,” the spokesperson said.“If you were going to put something in the car to break glass it wouldn’t be a headrest.”The NRMA said headrests are designed to be detachable to allow for easy adjustment of the seat and to be removed for cleaning. And according to the NRMA, glass in cars is not designed to be easily broken and, depending on whether the glass is laminated or tinted, it can be increasingly difficult to do so. “It’s really hard to break the glass in cars. They are designed to be difficult to break,” the spokesperson said.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1780101995608744&set=a.1544306222521657&type=3&theater,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2006C00263,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/car-headrests-emergency-escape/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZTa8Nh0VlE,https://www.ancap.com.au/about-ancap,https://www.mynrma.com.au/cars-and-driving",Car headrests not designed as glass-breakers,,,,,,

AAP FactCheck could not find the original post. However various versions of the same or similar claims – that the name of the aged pension is to be changed – have been shared by a number of Australian users and pages, including in the comments of posts on politicians and political party pages.One Australian accounting business took it upon themselves to check the legitimacy of the circulated claim.The Age Pension has had changes made to eligibility age and means test but not to the terminology for the payment.A spokesperson for federal Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston advised AAP Fact Check that the information contained in the Facebook post “bears no relation to Austrailan Age Pension provisions.” The spokesperson also advised the text was based on a viral email that originated in the United States several years ago and has since been circulated around the world.US fact checking organisation Snopes and a US news outlet have also debunked the claim.According to the Australian Government’s Department of Human Services website, the payment is still referred to as Age Pension. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) states that age pension schemes were introduced in the states of New South Wales (1900), Victoria (1900), and Queensland (1908), but were replaced by Commonwealth payments in 1908 to men aged 65, and paid to women aged 60 in 1910.Pension means tests have undergone significant changes throughout the years, according to the ABS. From July 2019 the qualifying age for Age Pension was increased by six months to 66 years.

Genetic modification involves altering the genetic material in plants, animals or microorganisms in a way that does not naturally occur normally through mating or reproduction and allows “selected individual genes” to be transferred from one organism to another and inter-species, according to the World Health Organisation.Genetically modified soybean seeds at a farm in Brazil.Products are genetically modified to improve their durability and nutritional value at a lower cost. Genetic modification can also increase crop resistance to diseases.In Australia, three types of GM crops are grown commercially, according to the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development. GM cotton crops are insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant. GM canola is herbicide-tolerant and has a high omega-3 oil content, and GM safflower, which is cultivated for vegetable oil, has a super high amount of oleic acid.Organisations including Greenpeace have expressed concerns about the rise of GMO products, arguing the practice could adversely impact people and the environment. Greenpeace in the United States claims that “genetically engineered crops directly promote an industrial and chemical-intensive model of farming harmful to people, the environment, and wildlife”.The World Health Organisation (WHO) states the safety of GMO products should be “addressed on a case-by-case basis” but says the GMO products “currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health”.“In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.”Biofortification, according to the WHO, is the process of nutritionally enhancing food crops through agronomic practices such as managing crops to promote soil and water conservation, conventional plant breeding and modern biotechnology, which can include GMO. The WHO states the aim of biofortification is to “increase nutrient  in crops during plant growth rather than through manual means during processing of the crops”. Examples of biofortified foods include rice, beans and sweet potatoes with increased levels of iron or zinc depending on the type of biofortification.Associate Professor Alex Johnson, a plant biologist specialising in plant nutrition and biofortification at the University of Melbourne told AAP FactCheck the statement in the post is “completely false”. Dr Johnson said the post confused the word “biofortified” with “bioengineered”, a term the US Department of Agriculture adopted in 2018 to describe that contain detectable genetic material that has been modified through lab techniques.Regarding the post’s claim that “biofortified” is another word for GMO, Dr Johnson said “a biofortified crop could be a GMO or not, depending on how it was developed”.“For the moment most biofortified crops are not GMOs,” he said.","https://www.facebook.com/offgridandorganic/photos/a.673188322757893/2558944030848970/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/offgridandorganic/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/FAQ-genetically-modified-foods,http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/Content/9AA09BB4515EBAA2CA257D6B00155C53/$File/11%20-%20Genetically%20modified%20(GM)%20crops%20in%20Australia.pdf,https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/issues/gmos/,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/FAQ-genetically-modified-foods,https://www.who.int/elena/titles/biofortification/en/,http://www.monsantoglobal.com/global/in/products/pages/agronomics.aspx,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324979572_The_Role_of_Agronomic_Practices_on_Soil_and_Water_Conservation_in_Ethiopia_Implication_for_Climate_Change_Adaptation_A_Review,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person242977,https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2018/12/20/establishing-national-bioengineered-food-disclosure-standard",“Biofortified” is not the new word for GMO foods,,,,,,
300,,,,Mixture,,2019-10-25,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/hyde-park-climate-protest-aftermath-post-is-misleading/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from October 21, 2019 by The Greens Little Bag of Stupidity which featured a photo of a park filled with rubbish. A caption in the image reads, “Aftermath of climate change rallye (sic) in London Hyde Park.” The Facebook post is captioned, “#Auspol”.A Facebook post from October 21, 2019 shows a photo of London’s Hyde Park filled with rubbish, which it claims was the aftermath of a climate rally.The Greens Little Bag of Stupidity page has more than 4700 likes and claims, “The Greens Party is the most irresponsible and ignorant political party in Australia. It is time to rid this nation of their STUPIDITY.”The post has been shared more than 190 times and attracted more than 30 comments and 300 reactions. The AnalysisA series of global protest marches were staged in 2019 to support stronger climate action. In March the School Strike for Climate event saw more than a million people rally while the Global Strike 4 Climate event in September drew millions. The image of rubbish strewn was taken in London’s Hyde Park. It first appeared in a Twitter post by London charity Royal Parks on April 23, 2019 which stated, “There’s a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning. This photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch. It costs us millions to clear #litter every year. Please take it home.” Royal Park’s tweet confirmed the litter was not by Extinction Rebellion climate protesters but rather a “result from an unofficial event”. Extinction Rebellion describes itself as an “international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse”. The group held a five-day event near Hyde Park from April 15-20, 2019, marching from Marble Arch to Britain’s parliament to call for MPs to “discuss climate change policies”. THTC – The Hemp Trading Company, a UK based ethical clothing label which uses hemp and other eco-friendly materials, posted the same image of Hyde Park strewn with rubbish on April 21, 2019. The caption originally read, “This is #HydePark after #420. Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves. Ironic for a movement that holds a plant in such high regard. #cannabiscommunity you can do better – you need to do better.” The page updated the caption to say the Extinction Rebellion protesters had helped clean up the rubbish following the Hyde Park 420 event. “EDIT: Posted this in the comments, but all this ended up being cleaned up by a crew from Extinction Rebellion, which included the absolute eco-warrior legend, Swampy!”THTC – The Hemp Trading Company went on to post a second update to clarify that while the climate protesters were nearby, the Hyde Park 420 event attendees were the ones responsible for the rubbish, not theExtinction Rebellion protesters. “IMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post. This was the aftermath of Hyde Park 420 – and was *cleaned up* by Extinction Rebellion crew. THTC is nothing but supportive of XR. Please read *all* the post copy before flying off the handle, people.” Extinction Rebellion also tweeted a statement on April 22, 2019 to say there was “a totally separate event that took place in Hyde park. #ExtinctionRebellion activists went to help tidy up anyway because it grossed us out as much as it does you.” The photo resurfaced in September 2019 after the Global Strike 4 Climate event when the Australian Youth Coal Coalition claimed it was climate protesters who left rubbish in Sydney’s Hyde Park.The photo resurfaced in September 2019 following the Global Strike 4 Climate event after the Australian Youth Coal Coalition claimed it was climate protesters who were responsible for leaving rubbish in Sydney’s Hyde Park. The news site 10 daily reported that social media users pointed out the image was not from the Sydney event. The post was later removed from the Australian Youth Coal Coalition page.","https://www.facebook.com/TheGreensLittleBagofStupidity/photos/a.821287754573654/2521115501257529/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheGreensLittleBagofStupidity/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/19/school-climate-strikes-more-than-1-million-took-part-say-campaigners-greta-thunberg,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests,https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park,https://twitter.com/theroyalparks/status/1120616230405193728/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1120616230405193728&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2019%2Fsep%2F21%2Fclimate-strikes-hoax-photo-accusing-australian-protesters-of-leaving-rubbish-behind-goes-viral,https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/,https://rebellion.earth/event/this-is-an-emergency-marble-arch/,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-48023800,https://www.facebook.com/THTC1/photos/a.96904099348/10157525788004349/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/ExtinctionR/status/1120332161129820161,https://10daily.com.au/news/australia/a190921xnogq/photo-claiming-to-show-climate-strike-rubbish-deleted-from-facebook-after-fake-news-reports-20190922,https://10daily.com.au/news/australia/a190921xnogq/photo-claiming-to-show-climate-strike-rubbish-deleted-from-facebook-after-fake-news-reports-20190922",Hyde Park climate protest aftermath post is misleading,,,,,,

The post claims them as evidence there has been no rise in sea level in Sydney Harbour 140 years.A Facebook post from June 1, 2019 shows two photos of Fort Denison and claims there has been no sea level rise in Sydney Harbour. The post shows the two pictures side by side, one in black and white, with text at the top reading, “unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0cm over the past 140 years”.The post has generated more than 2,100 shares, over 1,600 reactions and 180 comments. Similar versions of the post have appeared on other Australian pages here and here.The AnalysisThe first photo of Fort Denison was taken prior to 1885, according to the State Library of NSW, which has the original image in its archives. The distinctive tower structure on the island was completed in 1857.  The Bureau of Meteorology has sea level reading records dating back to 1914 for Fort Denison.AAP FactCheck was unable to find the origin of the second photo but the naval ship in the background bears the number 304, which is the identifier for Australian navy ship HMAS Success. The HMAS Success was in service from 1984 until June 2019.Fort Dension sits on an island in Sydney Harbour that was a detention location before work began in 1840 on construction of the stone building.AAP FactCheck was unable to verify if the images were taken 140 years apart. However, according to the timelines of Fort Denison’s construction and the launch of the HMAS Success, the photo were taken between 99 years and 162 years apart.A spokesperson for the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said sea levels have risen by between about 68mm and 105mm in Sydney Harbour between 1914 and 2007.“Global rates of change range from 1.4 mm/yr (between 1901 and 1990) to 3.2 mm/yr (between 1970 and 2015), while estimates of sea level rise within Sydney Harbour range from 0.73 – 1.13 mm/yr (between 1914 and 2007), slightly less than the global average,” the spokesperson said.The data referenced by the BOM spokesperson is from a 2009 study commissioned by the NSW Department of Environment.Regarding the photographs used in the post, the BOM spokesperson said using the images to determine a change in sea level would be impossible.“Sea level varies throughout the day and year due to the influence of tides and seasonal shifts in weather systems,” the spokesperson said.“Just as two single photographs of equivalent sea level, at a particular location, do not tell us whether the tide is coming in or going out, two single photographs from a location taken many years apart do not inform whether sea level is rising or falling over that period.“A good analogy for this is that we don’t find a picture of a hot summer’s day from 1950, and a picture from a cold winter’s day in 2010, and infer that there has been no warming trend over that time.”","https://www.facebook.com/Aussiedownunda/photos/a.542297979269024/1395378947294252/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156904906528737&set=a.398620963736&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/JasonWoodforthNudgee/photos/a.582049051923685/1982287458566497/?type=3&theater,http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110315860,http://digital.sl.nsw.gov.au/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=FL1230998&embedded=true&toolbar=false,https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/Conservation-management-plans/fort-denison-conservation-management-plan-180234.pdf,http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-success-ii-part-two,https://sealevel.info/You_Zai-Jin_et_al_2009.pdf",Fort Denison pics no indicator of sea level rise,,,,,,

In May 2019, news website 10 daily noticed the post trending and labelled its claim as “fake” in a report. The warning post was shared by the page Queensland Through Your Eyes before the content was removed.The 10 daily report noted there was no indication of who was behind the warning, “nor when or where the activity has taken place”. Police in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia received no reports of vegans and animal activists pulling the rear pins of stationary cattle trucks.AAP FactCheck was unable to track down the origins of the Facebook post, but contacted police in the country’s three biggest cattle producing states – Queensland, NSW and Victoria – and also South Australia, the state where the Facebook page BP Glendambo is based, to verify the claim. Queensland Police’s Major and Organised Rural Crime Squad had not received any reports of the tampering described in the Facebook post, a police spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck. Similarly a spokeswoman for NSW Police told AAP FactCheck the Head of their Rural Crimes Investigation Unit had not received reports about such incidents as did Victorian Police’s Farm Crime Unit and South Australia Police. A National Farmers’ Federation spokesperson confirmed the group also did not have any evidence of such a practice happening.","https://www.facebook.com/glendambobp/photos/a.1733865230244942/2237456876552439/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/glendambobp/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.traveller.com.au/glendambo--fast-facts-5zdi,https://10daily.com.au/news/australia/a190514gvoay/debunked-urgent-warning-animal-activists-are-tampering-cattle-trucks-20190515,https://www.mla.com.au/globalassets/mla-corporate/prices--markets/documents/trends--analysis/fast-facts--maps/mla_beef-fast-facts-2018.pdf,https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/mocsrural/",No evidence of activists tampering with cattle trucks,,,,,,

So Please share show your support for Our Military.”The post has attracted more than 1800 shares and more than 25 reactions.The Blokes WORLD Facebook page was created in December 2012 and has more than 19,900 followers. The AnalysisThe Australian Army Badge, also known as the Rising Sun Badge, has evolved over a series of designs since the start of the 20th century. According to the Australian Army, there have been seven designs to date, starting with a first design in 1902 for Commonwealth forces fighting in the Boer War. Australian soldiers wore a third design during World War I and II. The current design, which is the one shown in the Facebook post, is the seventh. The Rising Sun Badge is worn on the upturned side of a slouch hat and is identified with the spirit of ANZAC, according to the Army’s website.All Australian Army emblems, including the Rising Sun Badge, are protected by legislation – Section 83 of the Defence Act 1903. The Act states that a “person who is not a member of the Defence Force commits an offence if (a) the person uses or wears a defence emblem or an emblem so nearly resembling a defence emblem as to be capable of being mistaken for such an emblem; and (b)  the person does not have the written authority of the Minister, or of a person authorised in writing by the Minister, to do so”.The Australian Army Badge is also known as the Rising Sun Badge and has been in use, with design changes, since 1902.Regarding the claim “Facebook Doesn’t think Military emblems are appropriate”, a Facebook spokesperson told AAP FactCheck via email the post was “absolutely false”.“We do allow military emblems, including those from the Australian Army,” the spokesperson  said.“As our policies clearly state, we only remove symbols representing dangerous organisations or individuals, including those representing terrorist, hate, and criminal organisations.”Evidence to support Facebook’s policy position is found on the Australian Army’s verified page, which uses the badge as its avatar. In 2015 the Snopes fact checking unit investigated a post which made a similar claim about US military emblems on Facebook. The post displayed the emblems of the United States Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Navy.

Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth” and is accompanied by a sketch of two men debating the number of sticks.The quote was posted to a public Facebook group called Conscious Quotes (Tolle, Rumi, Maharshi, Laozi, Dalai Lama, Ram Dass, etc.), which describes itself as “a spiritual playground for all to enjoy” and has more than 36,400 members.The post has been shared more than 300 times and has generated more than 400 reactions and 20 comments.The AnalysisMarcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor and philosopher who ruled between 161 and 180 AD. He was one of the most prominent Stoic philosophers and is best known for the book Meditations, his personal writings and ideas on the Greek philosophy. Stoicism was a school of thought and ethics that helped one live a virtuous life by surmounting fears and false desires.  The Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius looks over Rome from Capitoline Hill.The quote attributed to Aurelius has been shared widely on the internet. The quote with a different picture was posted on Facebook in 2017 by a verified page for Marcus Aurelius. Australia’s news.com.au shared the quote in a 2011 Facebook post as did the Facebook page We Know Nothing. The Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius is located on Rome’s Capitoline Hill.The quote has also been used on Twitter by Inspirational Quotes, which has over 97,600 followers and featured on Instagram, notably through an account purporting to be actor Jim Carrey, where it amassed over 21,000 likes. The book reviewing website Goodreads also attributed the quote to Aurelius.Two Classics academics told AAP FactCheck the quote did not appear in any of Marcus Aurelius’ known writings. Australian National University Classical Studies lecturer Dr Chris Bishop said the quote was not said by Aurelius. “The closest (writing to this) I can think of is the end of book four, section three of his Meditations where he contemplates the nature of existence and summarises: ‘The universe is change, and life is opinion’,” he said. University of Tasmania Professor Dirk Baltzly said even linking the quote to Aurelius would be generous. “This is not even a loose translation of any line in the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. It also conveys ideas that Marcus, as a Stoic philosopher, would positively reject,” he told AAP FactCheck. Prof Baltzly explained the Stoics believed there was no shortage of facts or truths, contrary to the quote attributed to Aurelius.“So if you must have a slogan or some bumper-sticker philosophy that Marcus Aurelius would approve of, it might be: “If you believe too much stuff on the internet, you’ll only have opinion – not knowledge. Learn some philosophy and start thinking critically!”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156311797265876&set=gm.527839491123967&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/groups/269544370286815/?tn-str=*F,https://www.facebook.com/groups/269544370286815/about/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/269544370286815/members/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Aurelius-Roman-emperor,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism,http://capitolini.info/scu03247/?lang=en,https://www.facebook.com/MarcusAureliusAuthor/posts/everything-we-hear-is-an-opinion-not-a-fact-everything-we-see-is-a-perspective-n/1903626963245371/,https://www.facebook.com/news.com.au/posts/202476516446396?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D,https://www.facebook.com/weknownothingofficial/posts/everything-we-hear-is-an-opinion-not-a-fact-everything-we-see-is-a-perspective-n/948314325539500/,https://twitter.com/inspire_us/status/1041772619094212608,https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wZBAKlO7A/,https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/73368-everything-we-hear-is-an-opinion-not-a-fact-everything,https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/bishop-cdc,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/humanities/dirk-baltzly",No evidence to link Marcus Aurelius to facts and truth quote,,,,,,

A Syrian child sleeps between the graves of his father and mother” and features a crying emoji.Rutaraj – BK’s page has more than 1900 likes and describes itself as a personal blog on Facebook.The post has been shared more than 170 times and attracted more than 130 comments and 980 reactions. A similar version was posted by Sydney-based freelance video production unit, Nahda Productions, which included a heading, “A Syrian boy sleeping between the graves of his parents (killed by Assad forces)”. The AnalysisThe photo in the Facebook post was originally taken by Saudi photographer Abdul Aziz Al-Otaibi who posted a black an white version to his Instagram page on January 4, 2014. The post’s translated caption reads, “Lying between the living quarters housing between his mother and father #Pictorial I hope the idea you like everyone writes a phrase for Halsoura and tells the story who understood from the picture.”Al-Otaibi posted a colour version of the photo on January 8, 2014 on his Instagram page with the caption which reads, “some kids might feel that their dead parents’ bodies are more affectionate to them than the people they’re living with.” On January 17, 2014, Al-Otaibi posted a screenshot of a tweet by Twitter user @americanbadu which showed his image of the boy sleeping in between two piles of rocks. In Al-Otaibi’s tweet caption, according to Google Translate, he wrote, “A picture from my photo he steals it and attributes it to a child from Damascus whose parents were killed and what do people feel when you lie” with two angry face emojis. Saudi photographer Abdul Aziz Al-Otaibi tweeted an image of the boy, who he identified as his nephew, and stated the image was not taken in Syria.Harald Doornbos, a Dutch journalist based in the Middle East, identified @americanbadu as an “American convert” who lived in Saudi Arabia and had 187,000 Twitter followers. He wrote in a blog post @americanbadu published the image to his Twitter account claiming “the picture is from Syria and suggests the dead parents of the boy were killed by the Assad-regime”. According to Doornbos, within minutes hundreds of accounts had retweet @americanbadu’s post and that “Western tweeps also began noticing the dramatic picture. They too put it on Twitter and Facebook”. He also claimed to be the first reporter who called Al-Otaibi to ask if the picture was taken in Syria.In a subsequent tweet, Al-Otaibi posted a collage of four photos showing the child around the piles of rock. In the tweet, he labelled the images “backstage” photos and said the child was his nephew.Al-Otaibi tweeted another photo of his nephew sitting and smiling in between the piles of rocks with the translated caption reading, “This is after a behind-the-scenes picture of Brahim, my brother’s son.” Al-Otaibi posted the same image with a similar caption to his Instagram page. Al-Otaibi told Doornbos the photos were part of a photography project he was working on and that he had driven “to the outskirts of Yanbu, 250 kilometers away from Jeddah” where he constructed the two graves from rocks and asked his nephew to lay down between the graves. “Every artist has ideas in his head. So I had the idea to make a project whereby I show in pictures how the love of a child for his parents is irreplaceable.

Please correct it.” He said @americanbadu responded with, “Why don’t you just let go and claim it is a picture from Syria and gain a reward from God. You are exaggerating.” Shortly after the exchange @americanbadu removed the tweet.Al-Otaibi said he was “very annoyed” and it was “not fair to take one of my photos totally out of context and use it for your own propaganda.” The Saudi photographer also posted screenshots of media reports debunking the false captions on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, writing, “Praise be to Allah, the media in the world understood a lot about the reality of the picture and reaped contacts and emails of many media people make sure and inquire about the picture and convey the truth in all realism has become a war and tossing and cursing and insulting and questioning the intentions and people claim in networking networks and some supporter and encouraging responses were very positive”.","https://www.facebook.com/ruturajbk/photos/gm.1724967264319434/140413363980253/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/ruturajbk/,https://www.facebook.com/nahda.productions/photos/a.699803340063893/716207158423511/?type=3&theater,https://www.instagram.com/azezphoto/,https://www.instagram.com/p/itq1WVjoD7/,https://www.instagram.com/p/i4DlXhDoDp/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://twitter.com/azizphotos/status/423991361025896448,https://haralddoornbos.wordpress.com/about/,https://foreignpolicy.com/author/harald-doornbos/,https://haralddoornbos.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/saudi-photographer-telle-me-this-is-not-syria-its-not-a-grave-and-the-boys-parents-are-not-dead/,https://twitter.com/azizphotos/status/423991870197600256,https://twitter.com/azizphotos/status/424000220381605889,https://www.instagram.com/p/jQLAhZDoGi/,https://www.expedia.co.in/Yanbu.dx4009,https://www.instagram.com/p/jThicVjoGs/,https://twitter.com/azizphotos/status/424973764477325312",Photo of sleeping ‘Syrian’ boy is falsely captioned,,,,,,

The lower map is titled “MOST PEACEFUL COUNTRIES:”, with corresponding countries also coloured red.  At the bottom of the maps is written “COINCIDENCE?”, while along the right side of the lower map is written: “iTrustScienceMoreThanReligion.”The attribution listed under the Least Religious Countries map reads “WIN/Gallup 2015”, while the attribution under the Most Peaceful Countries map reads “Annual Global Peace Index 2015”. The post has been shared more than 2900 times and attracted more than 300 comments and 2400 reactions. The AnalysisThe attribution on the “Least Religious Countries” map appears to refer to a WIN/Gallup 2015 survey which examined the state of religion across the world. The survey of 65 countries was based on 63,898 interviews and asked respondents two questions in order to make an assessment from different points of view.1- Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say you are: a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?2 – Does religion generally play a positive role, or negative role or no role in your country?China recorded the lowest score for people describing themselves as “a religious person” in a 2015 survey.The data, on page 134, showed China registered the lowest score for respondents describing themselves as “a religious person” (seven per cent) and the highest score for respondents saying they are “a convinced atheist” (61 per cent).Despite this ranking, the “Least Religious Countries” map in the Facebook post omits China from the countries shaded red. According to the data, China was the least religious country, followed by Sweden and the Czech Republic.The organisation that conducted the poll, Gallup International, is a non-profit polling, analytics and advisory business registered in Switzerland and headquartered in Washington D.C. WIN is the Worldwide Independent Network of Market Research, and conducts market research and opinion polls across the globe. China ranking as the least religious country in the survey was reported in media outlets in the UK and US.The post’s second map of “Most Peaceful Countries” appears to refer to the Annual Global Peace Index 2015 report by the Institute for Economics and Peace. The Institute For Economics and Peace is a think tank dedicated to developing metrics to analyse peace and quantify its economic value. The Global Peace Index of 2015 was the ninth edition and ranked 162 nations, covering 99.6 per cent of the world’s population, according to the report. The index used 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators to gauge global peace using three measures: the level of safety and security in society, the extent of domestic and international conflict, and the degree of militarisation.The top 20 countries ranked in terms of peacefulness were Iceland, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Japan, Australia, Czech Republic, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Slovenia, Germany, Norway, Bhutan, Poland, and the Netherlands. China, with a population of 1.4 billion, was ranked 124th on the Peace Index and given a “low” rating in the report’s “State of peace” rankings.","https://www.facebook.com/scienceatheism/photos/a.586459255089403/621475611587767/?type=3&theater,http://www.gallup-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GIA-Book-2015.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/14/map-these-are-the-worlds-least-religious-countries/,http://www.gallup-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GIA-Book-2015.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/14/map-these-are-the-worlds-least-religious-countries/,http://www.gallup-international.com/about/,http://www.winmr.com/who-we-are/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/most-religious-countries-in-the-world/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/14/map-these-are-the-worlds-least-religious-countries/,http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Global-Peace-Index-Report-2015_0.pdf,http://economicsandpeace.org/about/,http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Global-Peace-Index-Report-2015_0.pdf,https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview",“Least religious” vs “most peaceful” countries post omits China,,,,,,

The LNP transferred $170 BILLION from the Pension Trust into the Future Fund which covers retirement benefits for Public Servants and Politicians ONLY nice rort, Peter”.Text accompanying the post reads: “Pension is NOT WELFARE”.The post has been shared more than 460 times and attracted more than 40 reactions on Facebook.The AnalysisProfessor Peter Whiteford from the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy told AAP FactCheck the claim “is a longstanding ‘myth’ i.e. there is an element of fact behind it but overall it is not correct”.Prof Whiteford has done extensive research on Australia’s social security system, was a former adviser in the office of the Minister for Social Security from 1995-96 and has also done consulting work on social security with Australian and UK universities and with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).“There was a National Welfare Fund established in 1943 as part of the introduction of new social security measures in Australia,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email.“From 1945/1946 there was also a Social Services Contribution, which was in fact no more than an extra tax on income and was merged with income tax five years later.”Ben Chifley, Australia’s prime minister from 1945 to 1949, introduced the National Welfare Fund in 1943 when he was treasurer.The National Welfare Fund was introduced in 1943 by Ben Chifley, who was treasurer in John Curtin’s Labor government.A 1985 paper by I. Scott, of the Education and Welfare Group in the Australian Parliamentary Library, states on page 2 that the fund was established with the smaller of either £30 million (this is in pre-decimal currency Australia) drawn from consolidated government revenue or one quarter of individual income tax receipts.In 1945 Chifley, then prime minister, split income tax into two parts to create a separate levy to finance social security payments. The Parliamentary Library paper states on page 4 that this separate levy “created a mistaken belief in some quarters that the social services were thereby placed on a contributory basis”. A contributory system is one where people pay into a system over time to fund their future entitlements.In its 1988 yearbook the Australian Bureau of Statistics notes that the levy went into the National Welfare Fund, along with supplements from payroll tax and general revenue “but there was no link between personal contributions and entitlements“.David Stanton, from the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University and a former senior official in the Department of Social Security told AAP FactCheck the “7% of Aussie taxpayer funds” aspect of the claim most likely came from the maximum rate of social services contribution in 1946, which was one shilling and sixpence in the pound – equal to 7.5 per cent.The tax imposed ranged between three pence per pound for a single person earning above 104 pounds per year, or 1.25 per cent, and up to one shilling and sixpence per pound for those earning 220 pounds, or 7.5 per cent.A Department of Social Security spokesperson confirmed to AAP FactCheck the term “Aged Pension Trust” was a colloquial term used to refer to the National Welfare Fund.Regarding the date of 1939 that appears in the Facebook post, the Crawford School’s Mr Stanton told AAP FactCheck some people confuse the National Welfare Fund with a “contributory National Insurance Scheme legislated in 1938”.“Although the legislation was passed the scheme never came into effect. The introduction was deferred and then repealed in 1939,” he said.In 1950 the Menzies government rolled the separate levy and income tax into one and the National Welfare Fund was no longer funded from a separate contribution.In 1952 changes were made that meant money flowing out of the fund was replenished from consolidated revenue and, according to page 6 of the Scott paper, “the Fund ceased to have any direct relationship with tax collections and thus with any prospective or possible contributory scheme to finance social security”.In 1976, during debate on the bill that transferred the book balance of the National Welfare Fund into consolidated revenue, Minister for Industry and Commerce Senator Bob Cotton told parliament that the 1952 change meant “all social security payments are met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, even though moneys are still channelled through the National Welfare Fund Trust Account”.In 1985, under the Hawke Labor government, federal parliament passed a bill to repeal the National Welfare Fund Act 1943 and “to make all relevant social service payments directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund“. Prof Whiteford said the National Welfare Fund ended in 1985, “well before the Future Fund”.The Future Fund was established in 2006 by Liberal Treasurer Peter Costello and Finance and Administration Minister, Nicholas Minchin, to cover unfunded Commonwealth government superannuation liabilities.A Future Fund spokesperson told AAP FactCheck funding from government came from “a combination of Budget surpluses and the transfer of Telstra shares remaining after the third stage of the privatisation of Telstra”.“The Fund received no funding from any other source,” the spokesperson said.Beginning in May 2006, the government transferred credits into the Future Fund using money from the budget surplus, and in 2007, it began transferring Telstra shares into the Fund. The last government transfer into the Future Fund was in 2008 under the Rudd government which transferred 35 million Telstra shares worth $141 million. The overall government contribution to the Future Fund was more than $60.5 billion which was made from 2006 to 2008.The Future Fund invests to receive a return and build its assets. In a 2018 speech, Future Fund Chairman Peter Costello said the $60.5 billion “has grown to just under $149bn, that is, the Future Fund has made the Government $88bn.  This represents investment returns since inception of 7.9% pa.”The highest cash balance in the Future Fund recorded was $162 billion from 2018-19 which resulted from the Fund’s investment returns.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10219846234488314&set=a.10201810936017124&type=3&theater,https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/academic/peter-whiteford,https://theconversation.com/profiles/peter-whiteford-2016,https://treasury.gov.au/publication/economic-roundup-issue-3-2011/economic-roundup-issue-3-2011/ben-chifley-the-true-believer,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/4511255/upload_binary/4511255.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/prspub/4511255%22,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/3d68c56307742d8fca257090002029cd/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978!OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/3d68c56307742d8fca257090002029cd/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978!OpenDocument,https://socialpolicy.crawford.anu.edu.au/people/visitors/david-stanton,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/4511255/upload_binary/4511255.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/prspub/4511255%22,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/4511255/upload_binary/4511255.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/prspub/4511255%22,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=HANSARD80;id=hansard80%2Fhansards80%2F1976-03-16%2F0075;query=Id%3A%22hansard80%2Fhansards80%2F1976-03-16%2F0067%22,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/4511255/upload_binary/4511255.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/prspub/4511255%22,https://www.finance.gov.au/australian-government-investment-funds/future-fund/,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2006L01393/Explanatory%20Statement/Text,https://www.finance.gov.au/australian-government-investment-funds/future-fund/investment-performance-and-financials/,https://www.futurefund.gov.au/investment/how-we-invest,https://www.futurefund.gov.au/news-room/2018/10/18/04/29/20181019---speech---chairman---ppi-conference?page=0&itemsPerPage=15,https://www.finance.gov.au/australian-government-investment-funds/future-fund/investment-performance-and-financials/",Future Fund did not receive $170 billion from an “Aged Pension Trust”,,,,,,

Well I’ve just found out that the dairy farmers get 1.4 cents of that.”One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. October 10, 2019. The AnalysisOne Nation leader and Senator for Queensland Pauline Hanson has called for the dairy industry to be re-regulated after learning of the struggles faced by the dairy farmers.Senator Hanson told Sky News’ The Kenny Report farmers were getting short-changed by Coles and Woolworths – only receiving an additional 1.4 cents per litre of milk from a 10 cent increase announced earlier in the year to assist drought-affected farmers.Woolworths and Coles supermarkets increased the price of their own-brand milk by 10 cents per litre in February and March in 2019, respectively, and vowed to pass on the increase to struggling dairy farmers.AAP FactCheck examined Senator Hanson’s claim that dairy farmers were only getting 1.4 cents from the 10 cent increase by the supermarkets for every litre of milk.Senator Hanson’s office told AAP FactCheck the source of her 1.4 cent figure came from an interview Queensland dairy farmer Scott Priebbenow did with radio and TV host Alan Jones on Sky News on October 9, 2019.Mr Priebbenow spoke about his struggles on the farm, telling Mr Jones he has only received an additional 1.4 cents from the 10 cent per litre increase announced by the supermarkets in early 2019. Mr Priebbenow confirmed the 1.4 cents figure to AAP FactCheck and said that it related to a 10 cents per litre price increase by Coles in March 2019. He said Coles again raised the milk price by 10c per litre in July but that he had “received none of that 10 cents – it just went into (Coles’) pocket”.Just over a quarter of all milk produced in Australia (27 per cent) is consumed as fresh drinking milk, according to figures from dairy industry services body Dairy Australia. The rest goes to products such as cheese, butter and milk powder. A Coles spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that when farmers supply milk to a processor, only a small proportion of that milk goes into Coles brand milk, which represents 3.5 per cent of total national milk production.The spokesperson said Coles’ levy applies to Coles brand two-litre and three-litre fresh drinking milk but not on all dairy products, such as cheese or yoghurt, that may also be produced with the milk.When farmers are paid by their milk processor, the amount received for the portion of milk sold as own-brand is spread across the entire volume of milk they have supplied, resulting in the payment being diluted.A Woolworths spokesperson told AAP FactCheck regarding the milk levy rise: “The commitment that Woolworths made back in February was that all of the money raised through the (10 cent) levy went to dairy farmers in full and that indeed happened. That is subject to independent auditing to make sure the money that we send goes out to the dairy farmers.”The spokesperson explained the amount dairy farmers received from Woolworths brand milk varied “depending on the relationship with the processor and how much of your volume goes into Woolworths milk”.A spokesperson from the Queensland Dairyfarmers’ Organisation, which represents dairy farmers across Queensland, told AAP FactCheck farmers across the state received a proportion of the supermarkets’ 10-cent levy based on the proportion of their milk going into the supermarkets’ own-brand milk. The levy is not paid for milk sold under retail labels. “Farmers in Queensland receive between zero and five cents per litre increase in their farm price which reflects that 0 and 50% of their milk respectively goes into retail-branded bottles,” the spokesperson said.AAP Factcheck found that Senator Hanson’s statement was accurate based on the evidence of one Queensland dairy farmer. However, it cannot be verified that all dairy farmers were receiving the same amount the One Nation leader claimed. It is the case that farmers only receive the 10-cent levy on the milk sold as supermarkets’ own-brand product.","https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6093586806001,https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/media/Press_Releases/australian-dairy-farmers-have-now-received-an-extra-10m-from-woolworths-sustainable-dairy-initiatives/,https://www.colesgroup.com.au/media-releases/?page=farmers-to-receive-full-benefit-of-coles-milk-price-increase,https://www.2gb.com/dairy-farmers-emotional-message-after-selling-the-last-of-his-cows/,https://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/publications/australian-dairy-industry-in-focus-2018?id=B81A5CE26AAE4C0F898E8F3BFF0014D9,http://www.dairypage.com.au/about-qdo",Are dairy farmers receiving just 1.4 cents from a 10 cent per litre milk levy by the major supermarkets?,,,,,,

Based on Chinese Feng Shui, the one who does not transmit this message can lose this great opportunity … I do my part, you never know!”The post has been shared more than 500 times and generated more than 15 reactions. The AnalysisVariations of the December calendar post claiming different months containing days of the week with five-day combinations have been circulating on the internet and social media since at least 2010. This claimed “phenomenon” was debunked in 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and again in 2018. The Facebook post’s claim that “December this year” has five Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays is not correct and relates to December 2018.Dr Anand Deopurkar, a lecturer in algebra and research fellow at the Australian National University’s College of Science, told AAP FactCheck via email that while December 2019 does not have five Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays, “it does have five Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays”. “Take a month (with) 31 days, say December. It will always have three consecutive days that occur five times. In the next year, these three days will shift forward by one day because 365 when divided by seven leaves a remainder of one,” he said. Dr Deopurkar says the sequence differs slightly during leap years. “For leap years it will shift forward by two days. So next year (a leap year) in December we will have five Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.“In 2021 (not a leap year), we will advance by one, and we will have five Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and so on. When we advance by seven, we (get) back to where we started.”According to a feng shui expert, the Happiness Buddha carries the “money bag” sack over his shoulder and hands out gifts.Dr Deopurkar told AAP FactCheck the same cycle of three days of the week occurring five times in a month usually restarts in five to six years. “If we had no leap years, this number will always be seven, but because of leap years, it gets shortened somewhat because we advance by two in leap years,” he said. “In fact, the week configuration of the entire year repeats every five to six years. So any given configuration is actually not ‘that’ rare. If you saw a December with five Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, you’ll see it again in five to six years. The number 823 is way off.”A Sydney-based Chinese Feng Shui expert, Mina Zheng told AAP FactCheck that a month containing three days of the week occurring five times has nothing to do with a “bag full of money”. Carol Olmstead, a US-based Feng Shui practitioner, author and speaker, commented on the claim in a blog, writing “while there is a ‘money bag’ symbol in ancient Chinese Feng Shui, it certainly doesn’t involve forwarding emails”.“It’s not Feng Shui … and forwarding the email won’t make you wealthy … (it’s) just another email hoax … the ancient Feng Shui masters never used chain letters to bring luck.“In the Chinese culture, the Happiness Buddha carries the ‘money bag’ sack over his shoulder and goes around handing out gifts. That’s why you often see the statues or images of the Happiness Buddha in Asian restaurants and businesses.” Ms Zheng also told AAP FactCheck  the post’s statement that in “Chinese Feng Shui, the one who does not transmit this message can lose this great opportunity” was “a scam”. She said Feng Shui was based on the concept of “energy from the natural environment”.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2401385116774004&set=a.1488022528110272&type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/money-bags/?fbclid=IwAR0FE4nU7uvJpyQshxhE7ShM5c69cCnpSToKauax96NLDaa7qcxgSN6cHZc,https://fengshuiaustralia.com/is-july-2011-a-money-bag-according-to-feng-shui/,https://www.hoax-slayer.net/december-2012-5-saturdays-5-sundays-and-5-mondays/,http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33731381/why-this-rare-weird-month-of-five-full-weekends-is-not-that-rare-or-weird,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-sci-sn-five-fridays-20171229-story.html,https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?year=2019&month=12&country=29,http://www.workingdays.com.au/workingdays_calendar_2018_12.htm,https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/deopurkar-a,https://fengshuiaustralia.com/,https://fengshuiforreallife.com/Carol_Olmstead/index.html,https://fengshuiforreallife.com/Detailed/323.html,https://fengshuiaustralia.com/about-feng-shui/",Calendar ‘phenomenon’ occurs more often than every 823 years,,,,,,

The group was founded in 1999 and it provides “meals and support for the homeless & needy on the Gold Coast and in the Tweed Shire”.The post has been shared more than 100 times and attracted more than 20 comments and 330 reactions. The quote has been shared widely by groups and individuals on Facebook, including best-selling author Dan Brown. The AnalysisMark Twain (1835-1910) was a gifted author, journalist and humourist who is best known for the novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876 and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1885. Twain is regarded as one of America’s greatest writers.Dr Matthew Seybold, assistant professor of American Literature and Mark Twain Studies from New York’s Elmira College, told AAP FactCheck via email “the quote in question is not Mark Twain, but another 19th-century American author, Christian Nestell Bovee”.The quote is not by Mark Twain but Christian Nestell Bovee, says Dr Matthew Seybold, assistant professor of American Literature from Elmira College, New York.Bovee was an American author (1820-1904) who was known for his books, Thoughts, Feelings, & Fancies (1857) and Intuitions & Summaries of Thought (1862).   Dr Seybold referred AAP FactCheck to a June 2017 article he wrote for the Center for Mark Twain Studies titled ‘The Apocryphal Twain: “Kindness Is Language The Deaf Can Hear.” In the article he writes that “there is perhaps no greater testament to Twain’s lasting reputation than the habitual misattribution of miscellaneous wit and wisdom to his name”. “If the aphorism in question indicates a sentimental, nostalgic, or otherwise optimistic attitude towards humanity, it probably didn’t come from Twain.”Dr Seybold credited the origin of the quote to Bovee’s book, Thoughts, Feelings, & Fancies (1857) which includes the line: “Kindness. Language which the dumb can speak, and the deaf can understand.” The attributed Twain quote also does not appear in www.twainquotes.com, a site which describes itself as a “Directory of Mark Twain’s maxims, quotations and various opinions”.The only quote from twainquotes.com featuring the word “kindness” is, “Never refuse to do a kindness unless the act would work great injury to yourself, and never refuse to take a drink – under any circumstances”. The quote is from Mark Twain’s Notebook. Barbara Schmidt, a researcher, writer and consultant for Mark Twain related projects and also twainquotes.com owner, told AAP FactCheck “there is no evidence this quote originated with Mark Twain”. According to Quote Investigator, a website which traces the origin of quotes, a version of the “kindness” quote was first attributed to Twain in 1942 by columnist Walter Winchell in the St Petersburg Times – 32 years after Twain’s death. AAP FactCheck was able to trace the quote as first appearing on Facebook to at least April 2007.","https://www.facebook.com/AgapeOutreachInc/photos/a.633281833401436/2528764873853113/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/AgapeOutreachInc/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/MercyShips/photos/a.57420584899/10152243053769900/?type=1&theater,https://www.facebook.com/DanBrown/photos/a.10153315125996523/10153315126026523/?type=1&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Twain,https://www.elmira.edu/academics/programs/faculty/humanities.html,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10757754/c_n_bovee_obituary_of_christian/,https://marktwainstudies.com/apocryphaltwainoptimism/,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=b68IAAAAQAAJ&dq=kindness+language+deaf+bovee&pg=PA240&ci=149,326,780,452&source=bookclip&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kindness%20language%20deaf%20bovee&f=false,http://www.twainquotes.com/index.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/quotesatoz.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/Kindness.html,http://www.twainquotes.com/twain3d.html,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/26/kindness-see/#return-note-7519-10,https://www.facebook.com/notes/jason-baumhover/in-light-of-virginia-tech-lets-not-forget-about-columbine/2378427422/",“Kindness” quote is not by Mark Twain,,,,,,

It’s amazing: this year is special. It happens only once every 1,000 years. This year your age + your year of birth, every individual is = 2019. For example, you are 55 years old and you were born in 1964, which adds up to 2019. Very strange, even the Chinese and foreign masters can not explain. Please calculate and see if the answer is 2019.

My age is, by definition, the number of years passed since my birth, which will be (2020 – 1986 = 34) in year 2020.”“When you add my age to my birth year, you are doing: 1986 + 34 = 2020, which is the current year.”Dr Katharine Turner, a researcher in computational mathematics and algebra and topology at the ANU’s Mathematical Sciences Institute, told AAP FactCheck: “What is true is that from your birthday in 2019 until your birthday in 2020 your (age + birth year) will equal 2019. “More generally from your birthday in year X until your birthday in year X+1, your (age + birth year) will equal X.  The ‘thousand-year wait’ claim is a bit misleading as it never happened before and never will again.”","https://www.facebook.com/greetingsbybarbe/photos/a.284861865000402/1402448863241691/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/chintskap/status/886429998290259969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E886429998290259969&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Ffact-check%2Fage-birth-year%2F,https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/deopurkar-a#biography,https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/academics/katharine-turner",Age and birth year claim doesn’t occur every 1000 years,,,,,,
315,,,,False,,2019-10-04,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/5g-network-radiation-suit-claim-is-false/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from May 14, 2019 by an Australian user that features an image of a person in a protective suit on a cherry picker next to a mobile phone tower with a palm tree in the background. A Facebook post from May 14, 2019, purports to show a 5G installation worker wearing a “hazmat radiation suit”. The image features a caption which reads: “5g installation guy wearing a f***ing hazmat radiation suit”. Lower down on the image is a story headline which says: “5G Tower install requires Hazmat suit to install.”The post’s caption reads: “Share the absolute s*** outta this before it gets removed again!!! We see you Facebook!”The post has been shared more than 55,000 times and has attracted more than 1200 reactions and 550 comments.   The AnalysisThe next wave of broadband technology is coming to Australia via the 5G network. The term 5G means “fifth generation” mobile network and it is expected “to offer about 10 times the bandwidth of the current 4G networks”, according to consumer comparison and research website Canstar.The new network will also allow more devices to connect at the same time and meet the large growth in data, Canstar reported in June 2019.Major telcos such as Telstra, Optus and Vodafone are involved in the rollout, however there have been questions raised regarding health risks posed by 5G. These include linking 5G radiation to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumours and Alzheimer’s disease, according to media reports. AAP FactCheck examined the Facebook post purporting to show a person wearing a “hazmat radiation suit” installing a 5G facility.Dr Ken Karapidis, a spokesman for the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), the nation’s primary authority on radiation protection and nuclear safety, told AAP FactCheck 5G installation workers are not required to wear hazmat radiation suits in Australia. “Mobile phone facilities are normally powered down or turned off when telecommunications workers are working on them to ensure exposure is kept below the safety limit,” he said.  “The rollout of 5G will not cause harm to workers or members of the public as all exposure will be kept below the limit required under the safety standard. No special suit is required to be worn by the workers.”Dr Karapidis also rejected the assertion that the person in the image was a “5G installation guy”.“The mobile phone facility in the picture is not a 5G facility and the worker seems to be cleaning it, which is probably the reason why the worker is wearing a suit (i.e. to avoid getting wet),” he told AAP FactCheck via email. An Optus spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that 5G mobile tower’s maximum radiation levels for the general public’s exposure were “typically three to five per cent of the safe levels set by ARPANSA”.The spokesperson said the industry relied independent scientific organisations like the World Health Organization, as well as Australian regulators the Australian Communications and Media Authority and ARPANSA, to establish rules regarding the safety of mobile transmissions. “Electromagnetic energy levels must comply with strict independent regulations. We regularly report and are subject to independent testing,” the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.If ACMA finds that a carrier has failed to meet their licence conditions, they could be subject to court proceedings and face significant penalties, the spokesperson said.A Telstra spokesman told AAP FactCheck that WHO and ARPANSA advised the company there was no “substantiated scientific evidence that radio frequency technologies that operate within national and international safety standards cause health effects”. He said 5G wireless networks are designed to be very efficient and require low levels of network and device power, which means low levels of electromagnetic emissions (EME) on 5G. The spokesman said Telstra had conducted extensive EME testing on the 5G network and found the levels to be similar to 3G, 4G and wi-fi and well below the EME safety limits.“We take our responsibilities regarding the health and safety of our customers and the community very seriously,” he told AAP FactCheck. “We know some people are genuinely concerned about the possible health effects from EME and we are committed to addressing those concerns responsibly.”Telstra’s spokesman also agreed with ARPANSA’s Dr Karapidis that the worker in the image appeared to be using a pressure washer and wearing a disposable coverall suit. This was supported by Scott Krouse, the director of US-based National Association of Tower Erector’s Wireless Industry Network (NATE WIN) in a report by US fact checking unit Snopes from May, 2019. Snopes reported the likely origin of the image was from a post (scroll to third image) on the Instagram page “theorgonizedearth” on May 6, 2019 . Mr Krouse also told Snopes that behind the mobile tower appeared to be a monopole or “monopalm” that was “disguised to look like a palm tree”. Nello, a US-based engineer and designer of monopalms, say they are “designed to blend into the surrounding landscape” and wireless carriers use them due to difficulty in urban areas with securing zoning approvals. The 5G network is expected “to offer about 10 times the bandwidth of the current 4G networks”, according to Canstar.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10161753351260290&set=a.10150937364435290&type=3&theater,https://www.canstarblue.com.au/internet/when-can-i-get-5g-in-australia/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48616174,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-08-28/is-5g-safe-dr-karl-radiation-explainer/11416070,https://www.icnirp.org/en/about-icnirp/scientific-expert-group/details/seg-member-karipidis.html,https://www.arpansa.gov.au/about-us,https://www.who.int/about,https://www.acma.gov.au/,https://exchange.telstra.com.au/5-surveys-of-5g-show-eme-levels-well-below-safety-limits/,https://exchange.telstra.com.au/answering-your-questions-on-5g-and-eme-our-new-5g-faq/,https://natehome.com/about-nate/administrative-staff/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hazmat-suits-5g-equipment/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BxIJ93nnEr3/,http://www.nelloinc.com/wireless-cell-towers/monopalms.cfm",5G network ‘radiation suit’ claim is false,,,,,,

Text above the image reads, “Meet Labor MP ANNE ALY Confirmed that Labor would support a plan to extend section 18C to include Islamic blasphemy laws in order to prevent people from “offending Islam.” The text underneath the photo states, “In other words “Sharia Law by stealth.”The post reads, “This is coming sooner than I thought, forcing this cruel Barbaric cult ideology down our throats, changing our laws for a cult ideology is unconstitutional, UnAustralian, Under sect 44 Australian Constitution Muslims cannot be in parliament, shorten is hell bent on destroying this country, Wong is no surprise she is no Patriot, You vote fir(sic) Shorten or Labor you are destroying this once great country”. The post has been shared more than 2000 times and attracted more than 260 comments and 360 reactions. The AnalysisIn 2017, the Turnbull coalition government proposed a change to Australia’s anti-discrimination laws to replace the words “offend” and “insult” with the term “harass” in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 states, “It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.”Anne Aly was the first female Muslim MP to be elected to federal parliament in 2016.Labor MP Anne Aly told The Australian newspaper in a March 27, 2017 article there was “scope to reassess” extending section 18C, citing an increase in anti-Islamic rhetoric. Dr Aly gave examples of Muslim women being abused in public and having their hijabs “ripped off”. “I find it a little bit strange that someone can call you a ‘dirty Arab’ and that be covered under the bill, but if they called you a dirty Muslim, you’re not covered (under 18C),” she told The Australian.Dr Aly became the first female Muslim MP elected to the federal parliament in the Western Australian seat of Cowan in 2016. She was re-elected at the 2019 federal election.  In a 2016 interview with ABC RN’s Religion and Ethics Report, Dr Aly said she identifies as  being a “secular Muslim”. “I do believe in the separation of religion and politics and that’s what secular in any form of religion is,” she said. On March 28, 2017, The Australian published the reactions of Liberal MP Tim Wilson and Senator Nick Xenophon to Dr Aly’s comments on section 18C and religion. Mr Wilson said extending the Racial Discrimination Act to cover religion would “turn Australia into Saudi Arabia, where people can be hauled before courts for criticising religion”. Mr Xenophon said he would not support “the reintroduction of blasphemy laws in this country. Dr Aly released a media statement on March 29, 2017 saying she had “not moved to extend section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act to cover religion”. “I have never proposed an anti-blasphemy law, and I never would,” she said. Dr Aly told AAP FactCheck in the articles in The Australian she “talked about religious vilification on all people of faith, not just Muslims, its impacts, and that we should have a conversation about that”. “Unfortunately, the article (March 28, 2017)  in The Australian reported Tim Wilson’s view that extending Section 18C to religion would be a blasphemy law. This was not what I said, or suggested,” she said in a statement.Following the release of Dr Aly’s 2017 statement, The Australian published another article on March 30, 2017 which quoted the then Attorney-General George Brandis calling on then ALP leader Bill Shorten to rule out “any proposal by a future Labor government to extend the reach of section 18”. The article mentioned Dr Aly’s opposition to anti-blasphemy laws and said, “in her interview with The Australian she lent her strong support to a future debate about extending (Section) 18C to cover religion”.The article also included part of the transcript to Dr Aly’s interview in which her answer to the question, “One of the issues it (18C) doesn’t cover is religion. What do you think about that? Do you think there is scope to see this applied more broadly so that it’s not just an issue about racial discrimination but it can capture other forms of discrimination too?”, acknowledged some religions, including Jews and Sikhs, were already covered under the Act because of “precedents that were set in legal cases outside of Australia”.She responded by saying there was “this new form of racism is one that also affects and impacts on religions and in particular, Islam, Muslims – OK – and Muslim people”. “So there is scope to, I guess, reassess how we look at racism in terms of its targets and its impacts and expand the scope of what we mean by racism to include those,” she said.Dr Aly told AAP FactCheck “the Facebook post makes a false statement that I confirmed Labor would support a plan to extend Section 18C to include blasphemy”.“The Facebook post is particularly alarming, as I have previously actively campaigned against the introduction of blasphemy laws in Pakistan,” she said. “I travelled there in 2015 as an academic to speak about secularism and religious pluralism, risking my own life in doing so.”In the post’s caption, it states, “Under sect 44 Australian Constitution Muslims cannot be in parliament…”  Section 44 of the Constitution sets restrictions on who can be a candidate for federal parliament.  It states, “Any person who is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power … shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.”  Section 44 does not carry any reference prohibiting a Muslim from becoming a member of parliament. Section 116 of the Constitution also states that “the Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215259465372927&set=a.1030572197563&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/theprojecttv/status/877083693965230080,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/21/turnbull-pursue-18c-changes-despite-warning-marginal-seats,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00089,https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=13050,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/18c-changes-should-cover-complaints-already-lodged-turnbull-told/news-story/01f5bfeb4a822f6a03fd45cdd3d817bb,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australia-s-first-female-muslim-mp-is-much-more,https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/anne-aly-campaign-to-be-australian-parliaments-female-muslim-mp/7573550,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/move-for-blasphemy-law-could-turn-us-into-saudi-arabia/news-story/2e24bb72c93bca28c25b0ea305f9420c,https://www.annealy.com/news/media/media-release-stories-in-the-australian-newspaper-wednesday-29-march-2017/,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/move-for-blasphemy-law-could-turn-us-into-saudi-arabia/news-story/2e24bb72c93bca28c25b0ea305f9420c,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/18c-reform-fears-labor-will-apply-act-to-include-religion/news-story/5b6851fc3115238b75ff9c1e43678e4b,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/Section44,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/Freedomofreligion/Interim_Report/section?id=committees%2Freportjnt%2F024110%2F2517",Labor’s Anne Aly did not support a plan to include “Islamic blasphemy laws”,,,,,,

The post read: “BE AWARE FOLKS… A colleague went away and house was ransacked and to cut a long story short the insurance would not pay out as she had blatantly posted pictures on Facebook which sometimes shows your destination. Apparently there is something in her small print on her insurance documents about social media whilst you are away.

In 2016, insurer GIO commissioned a survey of 3,283 Australians and found 50 per cent posted updates to their social media accounts while away on holiday.GIO warned that Australians should tighten their online security or risk “leaving themselves exposed to opportunistic thieves scouring social media networks for vulnerable targets”. In 2016, a survey by insurer GIO found 50 per cent of Australians posted updates to their social media accounts while on holiday.However, GIO spokesperson James Spence rejected the social media post’s claim that uploading travel pictures could void home insurance claims in Australia.“While we strongly recommend you are mindful of how you promote your travel plans on social media as this can be a signal for would-be thieves, your posts won’t void your home insurance,” he told AAP FactCheck.  AAP FactCheck also sought comment from the peak body for the Australian insurance industry, the Insurance Council Australia (ICA), regarding the post.An ICA spokesman told AAP FactCheck the post’s assertion that social media updates could void insurance claims was “rubbish”. “The Insurance Council of Australia’s Understand Insurance financial literacy initiative advises travellers to avoid putting their travel plans and destinations on social media to reduce the risk of being robbed while their home is unoccupied.

September 30, 2019.  The AnalysisLabor shadow assistant minister for Treasury Andrew Leigh has argued that a review of the retirement income system announced by the coalition government on September 27 will reduce the benefits of superannuation. In an interview on ABC radio on September 30, Mr Leigh said that “Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as we do on electricity – some $30 billion a year.” AAP FactCheck has examined Mr Leigh’s claim that Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as electricity.Mr Leigh’s office told AAP FactCheck his statement was based on a report by the Productivity Commission – a federal government research and advisory body – from December 2018. This report titled, Superannuation: Assessing Efficiency and Competitiveness, states “Australians pay over $30 billion a year in fees on their super (excluding insurance premiums).” The Productivity Commission said the estimated figure was consistent with a 2018 study by financial services information company Rainmaker Group which found Australians paid up to $32 billion a year in super fees.The Rainmaker study analysed more than 2500 fee options offered by 550 superannuation products representing 20 million member accounts. Mr Leigh’s office also referred AAP FactCheck to a tweet by Australian National University (ANU) economist Ben Phillips, who on Monday said: “Reminder Oz households spend twice as much on superannuation fees as we do on electricity”. Regarding electricity costs, Mr Leigh’s office told AAP FactCheck that Australian households’ total expenditure on power was $14 billion in 2015-16. A spokesperson for Mr Leigh said the figure was sourced from the 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mr Phillips said he used ABS data from the 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey to estimate $13.88 billion was spent by Australians on electricity per year.“Roughly speaking, we spend about twice as much on super fees as we do on electricity for the family home,” he told AAP FactCheck.An ABS spokesperson also provided calculations how a figure of about $14 billion in annual electricity costs can be reached. Average household weekly expenditure on electricity was $29.81, according to the Household Expenditure Survey, and with 8,959,600 households in Australia the total yearly expenditure comes to $13.926 billion.It is worth noting that the $30 billion estimate of superannuation fees has not gone unchallenged. Actuarial consulting group RiceWarner has disputed the figure, claiming the actual number is lower at just over $22 billion in an article titled ‘Fees versus value’, published on August 16, 2018.RiceWarner’s Superannuation Fees Analysis 2018 found Australians spent $22.4 billion on superannuation fees for the year ended June 30, 2017. The group’s analysis also found there had been a 27 per cent fee reduction over 15 years. “The whole industry is run at a cost less than the combined annual profits of the four big banks,” the report said.Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as they do on electricity to be true.","https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/andrew-leigh-on-superannuation-and-interest-rates/11561698,https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/superannuation/assessment/report/superannuation-assessment.pdf,https://www.pc.gov.au/about,https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/superannuation/assessment/report/superannuation-assessment.pdf,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/superannuation-super-fees-rise-32-billion-a-year-2018-10,https://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/people/associate-professor-ben-phillips,https://twitter.com/benphillips_anu/status/1178458067496603648?s=21,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6530.02015-16?OpenDocument,https://www.ricewarner.com/about-us/,https://www.ricewarner.com/fees-versus-value/",Do Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as they do on electricity?,,,,,,

The darker the patches, the higher the banana’s ability to boost your immunity and lower the risk of cancer”.Different versions of the post have been shared widely online, including here, here and here.The AnalysisIn 2009, Japanese researchers Haruyo Iwasawa and Masatoshi Yamazaki published a study on research that examined the effects of bananas on the body’s ability to produce an immune response.The researchers used bananas of different varieties and varying degrees of ripeness. Their study involved injecting mice’s bodies with a solution containing mashed ripe bananas and feeding banana juice to the rodents and monitoring the responses. Iwasawa and Yamazaki measured how the mice’s bodies produced immune responses, including the production of a substance called Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF is a protein made by white blood cells that may have roles in promoting or reducing the development of cancers. A form of TNF is also a contributing factor in some inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s Disease.A 2009 study reported on experiments injecting a banana solution into mice but did not say that Tumour Necrosis Factor is found in bananas.The Iawasawa-Yamazaki study made no reference to bananas containing TNF and did not make any findings about any relationship between TNF and cancer.Clare Hughes, chair of the Cancer Council Australia’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Committee, advised AAP FactCheck “the myth that a compound in overripe banana skins can cure cancer has been circulating for some time”.“There is no evidence that any single food or special diet can cure cancer,” she said.The Cancer Council is a charity in Australia “working across every area of every cancer, from research to prevention and support”.Associate Professor Darren Saunders, a cancer biologist at the School of Medical Sciences at the University of New South Wales, told AAP FactCheck that he was not aware of any evidence that TNF is found in banana skin.“Banana plants don’t even have the gene for making TNF,” Dr Saunders said.In 2018, science communicator and journalist Tanya Ha wrote an article for the ABC about dealing with false online claims, including the claim that eating bananas with brown spots could cure cancer, and how it affected her and her family and friends who were diagnosed with cancer. Ms Ha mentioned the banana meme and the Japanese mice study in the article, writing, “the scientists made no claim that the bananas produced the factor, or that they’d found a cancer cure. At best, the meme is gross misrepresentation of clinically insignificant research”.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2748665921833582&set=a.456264277740436&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/jerseydemic/photos/a.10150144138675681/10158033126590681/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/CureJoyInc/photos/a.140118672826022/1155543911283488/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/evolvingskydigital/photos/a.1372083246247791/1423911937731588/?type=3&theater,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/fstr/15/3/15_3_275/_pdf,https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-necrosis-factor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631033/,https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/183/4/tumour-necrosis-factor-inhibitors,https://www.cancer.org.au/news/spokespeople.html,https://www.cancer.org.au/about-us/,https://med.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-darren-saunders,https://med.unsw.edu.au,https://tanyaha.com/home/about/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-09-16/cancer-and-ripe-bananas-how-bogus-health-claims-hurt/10237738",Ripe bananas do not contain a cancer-fighting substance called TNF,,,,,,

September 26, 2019.  The AnalysisAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the United Nations General Assembly in September, defending his government’s action on climate change and telling the international body that the country “will have overachieved” on its Kyoto Protocol commitments to reduce carbon emissions.The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement struck in 1997 that binds signatory nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Australia committed to limiting carbon emission increases to eight per cent above 1990 levels by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s First Commitment Period, which ran from 2008 to 2012. Under the Second Commitment Period, which began in 2013 and ends in 2020, Australia committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to five per cent below what they were in 2000 – equal to 99.5 per cent of 1990 levels – by the year 2020.Australia came in under its first Kyoto target, with emissions averaging 565 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year. This allowed for 128 million tonnes that Australia could have emitted but didn’t and is now claiming as a carryover for the current period. Similarly, Australia is expecting to come in under its 2020 target (for the period 2013-2020) by around 240 million tonnes, according to the federal Department of the Environment and Energy’s 2018 emissions projections report. Adding the two amounts – 128 million tonnes and 240 million tonnes – gives 368 million tonnes or, after removing some rounding errors – the 367 million tonnes of credits referred to by the prime minister. The federal government is including that 367 million tonnes in its calculations for Australia to meet its 2030 commitments for emissions reduction under the Paris Agreement.Mr Morrison confirmed in December that Australia would use carryover credits to meet the nation’s emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement – the international agreement on climate change action after the expiry of Kyoto in 2020. [6] [7]But the use of carryover credits remains a subject of contention.An Australian Parliamentary Library report notes that Australia was one of only three countries, along with Iceland and Norway, that were allowed to actually increase their emissions under the first period of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia also negotiated two targets under the second phase of Kyoto: an unconditional cut of five to 15 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 as mentioned above, and a conditional 25 per cent cut that was dependent on other major economies moving to cut emissions. Discussion of Australia’s 2020 target has only focused on the lower end of the target range of five per cent.University of Technology, Sydney lecturer on global climate change policy Ian McGregor, told AAP FactCheck that Australia’s Kyoto targets were very modest.“Our Kyoto targets were absolutely minimal reductions,” Dr McGregor said.“We negotiated a very weak Kyoto target, so it was quite easy for us to achieve it.“Energy efficiency expert Alan Pears and Melbourne Law School fellow Tim Baxter wrote in The Conversation in May 2019 that the international community is unlikely to expressly ban use of carryover credits but they described the federal government’s position to use carryover credits as “morally dubious”.Other nations signed up to the Kyoto Protocol have decided not to carryover credits. In 2015 Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK all voluntarily gave up their surplus credits from the first Kyoto period, equal to about 735 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This took away the buffer they would have had to count towards their 2020 targets. The countries stated that through the cancellation they “hope to send a strong positive signal of support for an ambitious global climate agreement”.New Zealand has said it will not use carryover credits, with that nation’s Climate Change Minister, James Shaw, saying in December, 2018, that the Paris Agreement was “a completely new legal construct” and that New Zealand would discourage any country from using them. In July Pacific Island leaders called on Kyoto signatories not to use carryover credits in the Nadi Bay Declaration, a document in which they expressed concern about the level of commitment shown by developed nations to address climate change. Based on the evidence AAP FactCheck concludes that Mr Morrison’s statement is mostly true in that it is correct to claim that Australia will beat its 2020 emissions reduction target by 367 million tonnes because Australia is counting credits from the first Kyoto Commitment Period. Australia is already set to beat its 2020 target by 240 million tonnes and the addition of the carryover credits from 2008-2012 lifts that figure to 367 million tonnes. There is no restriction on Australia using these credits. It is notable, however, that other developed nations have chosen not to use credits from the first Kyoto period in order to encourage greater action to reduce emissions. Pacific Island leaders have also specifically called on nations not to use carryover credits.","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-defends-his-climate-change-record-in-un-speech-20190926-p52v0g.html,https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol,https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/what-is-the-kyoto-protocol/kyoto-protocol-targets-for-the-first-commitment-period,https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol,https://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/climate/topic/2016/kyoto-protocol-targets,http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/128ae060-ac07-4874-857e-dced2ca22347/files/australias-emissions-projections-2018.pdf,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/australia-set-to-dramatically-overshoot-paris-emissions-target/news-story/231724f59971f56a6b88d9fbc83bbe18,https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/international/paris-agreement,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/QG-DohaAmendment,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/QG-DohaAmendment,https://theconversation.com/carry-over-credits-and-carbon-offsets-are-hot-topics-this-election-but-what-do-they-actually-mean-116748,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/QG-DohaAmendment,https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/new-zealand-rules-out-using-kyoto-credits-for-paris-australia-shtum-20181211-p50llv.html,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-31/australian-climate-change-policies-criticised-pacific-leaders/11369086",Will Australia reduce its greenhouse emissions by 367 million tonnes more than what is required?,,,,,,

Military Intelligence is in FULL CONTROL”. The Facebook post has been shared more than 200 times and attracted more than 10 comments and 100 reactions.  The AnalysisThe purported image of a fighter jet pilot taking the selfie reveals there is no protective canopy over the F-16 fighter jet. Although the canopy on F-16s are transparent, light reflecting on the shield should indicate there is a protective barrier for the pilot but nothing is shown in the photo. The edges around the three following F-16 jets also appear to be blurred. According to Texas A&M’s Association of Former Students, the photo of the stadium was taken on November 26, 1999 during a Texas Aggies gridiron match by someone in a blimp. The Texas A&M’s Association of Former Students claim the altered image was created by a person affiliated with the US Air Force Reserve’s 457th Fighter Squadron of the 301st Fighter Wing.The stadium in the photo is Texas A&M University’s Kyle Field which has been the home ground of the Texas Aggies gridiron team since 1905. In 2014-15, Kyle Field underwent an upgrade to expand its seating capacity to 102,733 making it “one of the five largest stadiums in American collegiate football”. There was a flyover event on November 26, 1999 to remember students who were injured or killed in the Aggie bonfire collapse which occurred on November 18.The Texas A&M’s Association of Former Students claim the altered image was created by a person affiliated with the US Air Force Reserve’s 457th Fighter Squadron of the 301st Fighter Wing, based in Fort Worth to commemorate the flyover. AAP FactCheck found the image has been in circulation since at least 2004. The Facebook post’s caption claims “World leaders from Australia and India were in attendance.” John Howard was Australia’s prime minister at the time. Mr Howard made a “working visit” to the United States once in 1999 from July 9 to 13, according to the Embassy of Australia. He was not in the US on November 26, 1999 when the gridiron match was played. India’s leader in 1999 was Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Hay from South and Western Australia has been completely used, i.e. they’ve run out. Victoria is about to run out. When that goes there will be nothing to feed our breeding herds with so they will start to die.(disastrous for our farming industry) Hay can’t be imported as the risk of importing disease is way too high. WAIT FOR IT ..Our FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, (whoever that might be), has stockpiled over SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TONNES of hay bales on our wharves which will shortly be shipped overseas to Asia to fulfill contracts and they will not release it to our farmers. But they are happy for you and I to dig deep into our own empty pockets to supply the farming community with all the help we can give them. The government contracts can be fulfilled by purchasing hay from New Zealand and other nations and sending to it to Asia, leaving our own disease free hay for our own farmers.

The Australian’s story said “hay from domestic suppliers in Victoria and South Australia have been drained” as was stated in the Facebook post. The newspaper report also said “there are massive sheds owned by commercial exporters crammed with top-quality hay, particularly in West­ern Australia and South Australia, destined for cattle feedlots, vast piggeries and intensive dairy sheds in Japan, China and Korea”.A farmer hand feeds hay to cattle on a drought-affected property at Parkes, NSW, in 2018.The Australian’s report quoted Peter Saunders, “a farming leader from Cassilis in the parched upper Hunter Valley”. Mr Sanders called on the federal and NSW governments to release the export-bound hay to Australian farmers “given the exceptional circumstances”.The Facebook post also correctly stated that “hay can’t be imported”. A Department of Agriculture document from February 2019 titled ‘Importing stockfeed’ states that “hay has never been imported into Australia. It has a high risk of introducing plant and animal pathogens, viable crop seed, insect pests and weeds”.For the central claim the federal government “stockpiled” over 650,000 tonnes of hay bales to be “shipped overseas to Asia to fulfil contracts and they will not release it to our farmers”, AAP FactCheck sought comment from the peak industry body the Australian Fodder Industry Association.Australian Fodder Industry Association chief executive John McKew described the claim that the federal government has stockpiles of export-bound hay as “spurious and untrue”. “I cannot imagine why our own government would be out there buying hay to export to other countries when we have approximately 20 exporters in the country to fulfil that obligation,” he told AAP FactCheck. “Our own federal government does not get into the business of buying product to export to other countries. The government sets the process and protocols and regulations around (exporting) but they don’t physically do that themselves.”The 2018 report in The Australian quoted Mr McKew stating there was” 600,000 tonnes of hay stored by hay exporters – about 40 per cent held in WA and 35 per cent in SA – to be shipped in the next six months, was all to meet committed pre-­orders mainly from China and Japan”. Mr McKew told AAP FactCheck that “at any point in time hay exports represent about 10 per cent at best” of Australia’s total production.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=469544320209605&set=a.229458567551516&type=3&theater,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-31/hay-redistribution-could-kill-industry-exporters-warn/10181948?fbclid=IwAR2nCmGXv0abLEj8bn3XhLp5L3dKyuuJoWnoLLzFl2ApRsdVzmxcEjSzzRY,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/nation/desperate-farmers-call-to-seize-the-hay-from-exporters-stockpiles/news-story/b75c3b09a5bc5d56eb433878e41250fe,http://www.agriculture.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/importing/importing-stockfeed-factsheet.pdf,https://www.afia.org.au/index.php/about-afia/strategic-plan",Hay supplies post not correct on government stockpiles claim,,,,,,

Ishak at My Reef’s Diary, a travel group.The activity in 2017 resulted in about 150,000 people being evacuated from the area. Volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas,  into the atmosphere, according to the US Geological Survey. The USGS said the 1980 eruption of Washington’s Mount St Helens released approximately 10 millions tons of  CO2 into the atmosphere in just nine hours. But humans emit even more, the organisation said. “It currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity’s emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year,” the USGS says in an article on its website.USGS scientist Terry Gerlach, in a 2011 paper published by the American Geophysical Union, said that volcanic emissions include CO2 from “erupting magma and from degassing of unerupted magma beneath volcanoes”.Dr Gerlach wrote in that paper that: “The climate change debate has revived and reinforced the belief, widespread among climate skeptics, that volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities. In fact, present-day volcanoes emit relatively modest amounts of CO2, about as much annually as states like Florida, Michigan, and Ohio”. University of New South Wales physical meteorology and atmospheric climate dynamics expert Professor Steven Sherwood told AAP FactCheck that “on average over time, volcanoes emit about one percent as much CO2 as humanity.”“Humanity emits enough CO2 to cover the entire Earth with a 2cm layer every year, way more than any volcano.  Since the ‘beginning of time’ humanity has emitted billions of cubic kilometers of CO2,” he said in an email.Professor Sherwood said the recent Mt Agung eruptions in 2017 and 2019 were “quite average”.“Agung erupted much more violently in 1963, and we’ve had several others since that have reached well into the stratosphere,” he said, A similar conclusion was reached by the British Geological Survey in a paper entitled ‘Volcanic Contributions to the Global Carbon Cycle’, published in 2005. The British Geological Survey said, in the summary of the paper: “Present day geological emissions of CO2 include both volcanic emissions (both passive, from volcanoes in repose, and those related directly to eruptive activity) and non-volcanic – direct emissions from the Earth’s crust and lithosphere. The contribution to the present day atmospheric CO2 loading from volcanic emissions is, however, relatively insignificant, and it has been estimated that subaerial volcanism releases around 300 Mt/year CO2, equivalent to just 1% of anthropogenic emissions.”University of Queensland greenhouse gas emissions researcher Dr Alistair Grinham also told AAP FactCheck humans “contribute far more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than volcanoes.”“A recent estimate for the annual contribution from volcanoes is approximately 0.65 gigatonnes…whereas humans are currently contributing over 50 gigatonnes,” Dr Grinham wrote in an email.","https://www.facebook.com/NoGreens/photos/a.203861449959299/975213362824100/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/breaking?epa=HASHTAG,https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Agung,https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Agung,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/balis-mount-agung-jetstar-flights-resume-after-volcanos-second-eruption,https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=264020,https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/2017/11/29/mt-agung-eruption-expert-reaction/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-28/bali-volcano-eruptions-will-see-150000-people-evacuate/9199710,https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/gas_climate.html,https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/file_mngr/file-154/Gerlach-2011-EOS_AGU.pdf,https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/steven-sherwood,https://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=432,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1446",Claim that volcano emits more greenhouse gas than humans is false,,,,,,

People With Money reports on September 23, that Thunberg is the highest-paid activist in the world, pulling in an astonishing $46 million btwn Aug 2018 and Aug 2019, a nearly $20 million lead over her closest competition.”Text accompanying the image reads: “$46 million a yr to sail around the world telling us to suck it up…How F##king Dare You…”.Enough Is Enough Australia’s Facebook page has few details about the group but more than 6300 likes and 6500 followers. The page was created on August 1, 2018.The post has been shared more than 150 times and attracted more than 50 comments and 130 reactions. The AnalysisAAP FactCheck was unable to find any evidence of a publication titled ‘People with Money’. The ‘People with Money’ magazine cover was traced to a website called “MediaMass”, where the magazine cover image appears as part of an article titled, “Greta Thunberg Highest-Paid Activist in the World”. The article claims Thunberg took “the No. 1 spot on People With Money’s top 10 highest-paid activists for 2019 with an estimated $46 million in combined earnings”. It also claims that “she owes her fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetic” and that the young climate activist “owns several restaurants (the “Fat Thunberg Burger” chain) in Stockholm, a Football Team (the “Stockholm Angels”), has launched her own brand of Vodka (Pure Wonderthunberg – Sweden), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Greta) and a fashion line called “Greta Thunberg Seduction”. The MediaMass website features articles of high-profile individuals, all of whom appear in an image depicting the cover of the purported “People With Money” magazine.The MediaMass website features numerous articles of high-profile individuals, all of whom appear in an image depicting the cover of the purported “People With Money” magazine. Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai appears in one version of the cover. Celebrities including Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Ed Sheeran have also had their faces on the same ‘People with Money’ template, with text claiming they were named the ‘Highest-Paid Singer in the World’ on the same day.  Another version shows United States-based alt-right figure Richard Spencer, described as a white nationalist in US media. MediaMass says on its website that is “an international collective”  based in China and describes itself as a satire page that aims to “expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe”. AAP FactCheck was able to find fake articles and magazine covers by MediaMass dating back to 2013. The Chicago Tribune reported in 2014 that the MediaMass website “appears to be a coordinated effort to fool large numbers of people” and false MediaMass stories as a “hoax wrapped within a hoax”. It detailed how web users could edit “the website address with the name of a random celebrity, which in most cases will generate a new story and a fake magazine front page”.  MediaMass also publish stories in German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Chinese.","https://www.facebook.com/baybirds/photos/a.2278945512332706/2575284246032163/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/baybirds/?__tn__=k*F&tn-str=k*F,http://archive.fo/1a1YE,https://en.mediamass.net/people/greta-thunberg/highest-paid.html#,https://en.mediamass.net/people/malala-yousafzai/highest-paid.html,https://en.mediamass.net/people/beyonce/highest-paid.html,https://en.mediamass.net/people/lady-gaga/highest-paid.html,https://en.mediamass.net/people/ed-sheeran/highest-paid.html,https://en.mediamass.net/people/richard-spencer/highest-paid.html,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/tag/richard-spencer,https://archive.fo/X7a22#selection-1097.0-1097.98,http://wafflesatnoon.com/mediamass-fake-news/,https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-celebrity-death-hoaxes-20140203-story.html,https://de.mediamass.net/,https://fr.mediamass.net/,https://es.mediamass.net/,https://it.mediamass.net/,https://pt.mediamass.net/,https://cn.mediamass.net/",Greta Thunberg highest-paid activist magazine cover is fake,,,,,,

It has generated more than 660 shares, 80 comments and more than 140 reactions.The AnalysisGreta Thunberg has become the face of the youth global climate action movement since first starting a protest movement outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. In August 2019 Thunberg, 16, crossed the Atlantic in a solar-powered boat, travelling for two weeks before arriving in New York. On September 20 she led a Global Climate Strike in which four million people took part to advocate for government action on climate change. On September 23 she spoke at the UN climate summit where she delivered a call to action and criticised world leaders for their inaction.Hungarian-born George Soros was dubbed the “man who broke the Bank of England” in 1992, after he gambled about $US10 billion that Britain would be forced to devalue the pound. Faced with a wave of speculators selling the currency, the bank gave in and the sterling was forced out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism – the currency grid that preceded the euro single currency. Soros walked away with an estimated $US1 billion. The original photo is of Thunberg with former US vice president Al Gore and was taken in December, 2018.Soros also is chairman of the Open Society Foundations, a network of philanthropic organisations active in more than 120 countries. The foundations aim to shape public policy to promote democratic governance, human rights, and economic, legal, and social reform.Regarding the image in the Facebook post, the original image can be traced to Thunberg’s Twitter page and is dated December 30, 2018. It features the Swedish 16-year-old with former US vice president Al Gore and reads: “Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you. #climatecrisis #climatebreakdown”. The photo has been altered to replace Gore with Soros.Thunberg has been consistently targeted online linking her to the “elite globalist movement” – claims that have been found to be baseless. In April 2019 Swedish website Nya Tider published a story, claiming “several well-known wealthy financiers” including Soros were supporting Thunberg. The story was debunked by Wired magazine’s Italian website in May 2019.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=129424808400530&set=a.101391001203911&type=3&theater,https://www.georgesoros.com/,https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/greta-thunberg-bio-climate-change-activist-2019-9?r=US&IR=T,https://www.schoolstrike4climate.com/sept20,https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Soros,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Exchange_rate_mechanism_(ERM),https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are,https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/how-we-work,https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1079447661273583618,https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c200tx5l,https://www.nyatider.nu/the-global-network-behind-greta-thunberg/,https://www.wired.it/attualita/media/2019/05/02/greta-thunberg-onu-vox-gates-soros-bufala/?refresh_ce=",Fake image shows climate activist Greta Thunberg with George Soros,,,,,,
326,,,,False,,2019-09-25,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/old-west-whisky-shot-legend-is-not-true/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from September 21, 2019, by an Australian user featuring an image of a “shot glass” of whisky*, along with text under the headline ‘A shot whiskey’.A Facebook post from September 21, 2019, claims the word “shot”, in relation to whisky, comes from the “old west”.The post reads: “In the old west a .45 cartridge for a six-gun cost 12 cents, so did a glass of whiskey. If a cowhand was low on cash he would often give the bartender a cartridge in exchange for a drink. This became known as a “shot” of whiskey.” The post has attracted more than 15 shares, 10 comments and 100 reactions. * Note: Whisky is spelled ‘whiskey’ in American English, hence the discrepancy when the social media post is being quoted directly. The AnalysisThe Facebook post claims the word “shot”, in relation to whisky, comes from the “old west” which was an era generally defined from 1865-1895 and famous for cowboys, lawmen, gunslingers and outlaws.The etymology of the noun ‘shot’ meaning “to shoot” is taken from Old English ‘scot/sceot’ and is related to the German word Geschoss, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. The Online Etymology Dictionary lists another meaning as to “discharge of a bow, missile,” from the related Old English ‘gesceot’. This was “extended to other projectiles in Middle English and to sports (hockey, basketball, etc.) 1868”. The Online Etymology Dictionary lists ‘shot’ in relation to a small drink of straight liquor, as being first used in 1928.Monash University linguistics expert Professor Kate Burridge told AAP FactCheck via email the historical veracity of the post was not true, but said the mythology made for compelling fiction.“These stories are always so great – and I’m constantly raining on people’s linguistic picnics. Alas this isn’t the origin of the expression,” she said. Prof Burridge said ‘shot’, in relation to whisky was the same as the noun ‘shot’ and related to the adjective ‘scot-free’.Another meaning was ‘scots’ and ‘shots’ could refer to the amount to be paid at a tavern or perhaps for entertainment. For example, ‘to stand shot’ meant to pay the bill for everyone – it was an early version of ‘shouting everyone’, she explained. “It’s probably from this meaning that shot might have [taken] on the sense of something like “a supply or amount of drink” (whatever amount would result from everyone’s contribution),” she told AAP FactCheck. “And from there we can get to the more modern meaning “a shot of spirits” (a meaning that arose just last century).” University of Melbourne language expert John Hajek agreed the Facebook claim was not true. “It’s just made up. A ‘shot’ is probably the result of when you’re pouring the drink. That sudden jerking movement is where it almost certainly came from. It was also a word for payment in a pub or bar, which goes back to the 15th century.”Macquarie Dictionary chief editor Alison Moore also rejected the social media post’s claim.“The origin of this sense of shot has been investigated in the past, and I’m afraid that the colourful Wild West theory has been pretty soundly debunked,” she told AAP FactCheck.The Online Etymology Dictionary lists ‘shot’ in relation to a small drink of straight liquor, as being first used in 1928 followed by ‘shot glass’ in 1955. US fact-checking unit Snopes also examined the post and found one shot of whisky would have likely cost the equivalent of 10 cartridges. “Even allowing for price variations according to time and place, it appears highly doubtful a one-to-one correspondence between the price of a cartridge and the cost of a drink ever existed in the Old West,” Snopes reported.","https://www.facebook.com/oreillysfirearms/photos/a.1643283782559381/2404297146458037/?type=3&theater,https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/whisky,https://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/how-the-wild-west-was-spun/,https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-old-west,https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/shot,https://www.etymonline.com/word/shot,https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kathryn-burridge,https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person13831#tab-overview,https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4805386,https://www.etymonline.com/word/shot,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shot-whiskey-origin/",‘Old west’ whisky shot legend is not true,,,,,,

The sign features the logos of four organisations: Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP), the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), the United Nations Human Settlements Program and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).A Facebook post from September 13, 2019, features a photograph of a shop selling water in Naivasha, Kenya.On the sides of the shop front are words written in Swahili which, according to Google Translate, say “water containing fluoride” and “water without fluoride in litres” above lists of prices. The post’s caption reads: “UK Government Department For International Development (DFID), United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) all campaigning for Fluoride Free Water. They spelled the F word incorrectly, but their hearts are in the right place.” The post then includes a link to a 2011 story in The Guardian newspaper. The Australian Anti-Fluoridation Association has more than 1800 likes on its Facebook page. The page states the group was “founded in 1963 … to educate and inform people of the Fluoridation Folly”.The post has been shared more than 70 times and attracted more than 20 reactions. The AnalysisThe image used in the post was taken from the 2011 article in The Guardian newspaper, which is titled “Partnership working brings safe water to Kenya’s poor”. The article covered a project to build partnerships between service providers and businesses in the Kenyan town of Naivasha to ensure the locals had access to safe drinking water.The article mentions WSUP’s work on water projects in Naivasha. The works began in 2007 and included investment in “rehabilitating and equipping the private boreholes, constructing storage, fluoride treatment, distribution and a network of water kiosks”, the newspaper said.WWF told AAP FactCheck the organisation has never campaigned for fluoride-free water.Kenyan towns such as Naivasha rely on groundwater from boreholes for their domestic and agricultural demands. In these areas, the water sources have displayed naturally occurring  concentrations of fluoride of between 0.02mg/L and 75mg/L. In the Central Rift Valley in Kenya, where Naivasha is located, 73 per cent of water sources exceed the safe limit of fluoride concentration of 1.5 milligrams per litre set by the World Health Organisation. While fluoride in water up to a level of 1.5mg/L is rated safe to consume and can help reduce tooth decay in children and adults, the WHO says prolonged exposure to excessive levels of fluoride concentrations can result in fluorosis, a disease that can affect teeth and bones.Australian Anti-Fluoridation Association also added the post to an album on its page titled, “Organizations Campaigning for Fluoride Free Water.” The album’s title includes a sub-heading that reads, “Help build the list, let us know about organizations campaigning for Fluoride Free Water.”A spokesperson from WSUP told AAP FactCheck that WSUP’s involvement in the Naivasha water project ended in 2014. “When we handed the facilities over to the community-based management, the water quality test results were within WHO guidelines,” the spokesperson said.“Our position on this is that fluoride levels should be within WHO guidance.”WSUP works with utilities and businesses “to develop services which generate revenue” in order to support communities which lack access to water and sanitation.The WHO is an international organisation working to combat disease and coordinate international health responses. The organisation is an agency of the United Nations, as is UN-Habitat.WWF is an international conservation organisation working in 100 countries.A WWF spokesperson told AAP FactCheck while the organisation recognised the importance of considerations regarding adding fluoride to drinking water, “it is the preference of WWF to ensure that public commentary on this matter is left to public health experts”.“WWF has never campaigned for fluoride-free water,” the spokesperson said.A spokesperson from the DFID told AAP FactCheck that “UK aid is providing millions of people in the world’s poorest countries with safe drinking water, meaning they can live safer, healthier and more prosperous lives. “This includes making sure water does not contain a high concentration of minerals like fluoride, which can be dangerous to people’s health,” the spokesperson said.In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recommends water fluoridation and supports a range of 0.6mg/L to 1.1mg/L of fluoride in drinking water supplies.","https://www.facebook.com/118057278641801/photos/a.744319179348938/744320009348855/?type=3&theater,https://www.google.com.au/search?source=hp&ei=TTuIXeKjCZGGyAODv56oAg&q=translate&oq=translate&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i131j0l9.1093.2480..2624...0.0..0.147.1229.0j9......0....1..gws-wiz.ibqP-7IRRB8&ved=0ahUKEwii_vfW_-XkAhURA3IKHYOfByUQ4dUDCAg&uact=5,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/revolutionised-kenya-water-supply-business%E2%80%9D,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Australian-Anti-Fluoridation-Association-118057278641801/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/revolutionised-kenya-water-supply-business?fbclid=IwAR0fimKUl8UYb6uu-N9h5V6gmc-QOBIPitIhI5m4WI-w6j8DhNCWIYetIe8,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Naivasha,+Kenya/@-0.713515,36.4147574,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x182917f5252b1a5d:0x45c8fec3553fce47!8m2!3d-0.7171778!4d36.4310251,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715311426?via%3Dihub,https://www.who.int/ipcs/features/fluoride.pdf?ua=1,https://www.who.int/about,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/dentalfluoridation,https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/diseases/fluorosis/en/,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Australian-Anti-Fluoridation-Association-118057278641801/photos/?tab=album&album_id=744319179348938&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARACntNAzAC4By7rRvFw1vpStEPnegyqU6kTKZRcpb7oT9Lw4TfJY9XkLpjfrRO5CpidQYgzKu08dSwgl59oT08HW83PYR1mukDKgCTz2JplY2Ju4fM_6zffyH2Df1CYAwTgZWTmTkSZQbSy_roeU8CHRypaN-0BzSeB8LsvYebxRi335OWR4aW8zgLIzUWtjTJEmwk5vJXZQKz8Z1uL-k8BO-TMjPW5gTAj6vNJt8bROU8s-MtCD01J-YD06rA-_zC-RCY_it5hHK69wMVI8Y-9ZvvnRzjqZVfUTLp2f55PRs5nGOLPPH0DWCCE7pXTv9QTJfXmDB20n6lCHCMVsRA&__tn__=-UC-R,https://www.wsup.com/about/,https://new.unhabitat.org/governance,https://www.worldwildlife.org/about,https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/2017-public-statement-water-fluoridation-and-human-health","Development, environment bodies did not campaign for fluoride-free water",,,,,,

The self-described “study group” states that it has “no leaders or teachers” and that “everyone will be on an equal footing as fellow students”. The AnalysisBorn in 470 BC to a stonemason and a midwife, Socrates is credited as the man who introduced the concept that “virtue is knowledge” and is regarded as one of the fathers of Western philosophy. He wrote nothing and most of what survives was recorded by the philosopher Plato, who was his student, and the historian Xenophon.  Plato’s dialogues are considered the most reliable representations of what Socrates said. Recorded by Plato, Socrates challenged his accusers’ arguments by using a series of questions aimed at discerning the truth of a topic in a technique that became known as the Socratic Method. Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates (right) is regarded as one of the fathers of Western philosophy and Plato (left) was his student.AAP FactCheck sought the opinion of academics regarding the authenticity of the purported Socrates quote. Philosophy lecturer David Bronstein of the UNSW (the University of NSW) said scholars agree that Plato knew “the real historical Socrates well and that some of the views Plato attributes to his character were probably held by the real historical figure”. He told AAP FactCheck the quote didn’t “ring a bell” as being from Plato’s dialogues but that it might be a “paraphrase of a passage”. Dirk Baltzly, a professor and head of philosophy with University of Tasmania, said the quote matched “nothing I know of in our major sources: Plato and Xenophon”. “Sometimes people take very liberal approaches to translation and this could be someone’s notion of how to capture the spirit, rather than the letter, of some passage that is familiar me or other specialists. But it’d be a very, very creative translation of the ancient Greek. I certainly don’t recognise it,” he told AAP FactCheck.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2390846347851519&set=gm.854374144963934&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/groups/720546645013352/about/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Socrates,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xenophon,https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/plato,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Socratic%20method,https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/our-people/david-bronstein,https://www.unsw.edu.au/about-us,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/philosophy-and-gender-studies/featured-profiles/dirk-baltzly",No evidence that ‘smart people’ quote is Socrates,,,,,,
329,,,,False,,2019-09-20,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/no-evidence-to-support-vaccines-cancer-claim/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from September 12, 2019 by an Australian user which starts: “Yes, vaccines do cause cancer.”A Facebook post from September 12, 2019, claims that vaccines cause cancer.The post has been shared more than 200 times and attracted more than 150 reactions and 15 comments. The AnalysisThe World Health Organization (WHO) is the United Nations agency focused on combating disease and improving health standards. The WHO says that vaccination is safe, with any side-effects usually being minor and temporary – such as a sore arm or mild fever. The WHO says more serious side effects from vaccines “are possible, but extremely rare” and that an individual is “far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine”. The WHO says any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before being approved for use, with regular reassessments made after it is introduced. The Department of Health says every vaccine needs to pass strict safety testing before the Therapeutic Goods Administration will register it for use in Australia.Australia’s federal Department of Health says every vaccine needs to pass strict safety testing before the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will register it for use in Australia.The Department of Health says the approval process, which involves thousands of people taking part in large clinical trials, means it can take up to 10 years for vaccines to become available to the public. University of Sydney public health expert Professor Julie Leask is a visiting professorial fellow at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) and the founding chair of the Collaboration on Social Science in Immunisation – a joint initiative by the University of Sydney and the NCIRS. Prof Leask, who is also a member of the WHO standing committee on Immunization and Vaccines related Implementation Research – said the claim vaccinations cause cancer was “absurd”. “This is a reasonably common claim made by people who don’t believe in vaccination at all and want to claim that vaccines cause all manner of ills and that these sorts of things have been subjected to a gigantic cover-up,” she told AAP FactCheck. “There’s no evidence to back up that claim. It’s just an absurd claim.” Vaccine safety in Australia is monitored by the  AusVaxSafety program, which is overseen by the NCIRS and funded by the Department of Health. The organisation monitors adverse events following immunisation and facilitates early detection of potential vaccine safety issues. In the United States, scientists with The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, America’s leading national public health institute, work to identify risk factors that can lead to conditions like cancer, stroke, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. The CDC says there is no “plausible biologic reason to believe vaccines would cause any serious long-term effects.”“Based on more than 50 years of experience with vaccines, we can say that the likelihood that a vaccine will cause unanticipated long-term problems is extremely low,” it said in a guide to parents.The CDC says  vaccines may cause side effects but these are mostly “very minor”, typically only last a few days and are treatable, with serious reactions “very rare”.The Australian Academy of Science, in a 2017 document dealing with questions and answers about immunisation, noted that while immunisation protects individuals from a specific disease and its immediate complications, it “may also have long-term protective effects – from cancer and other chronic conditions”. Full Fact, an independent UK fact-checking organisation, has also investigated a claim that no vaccine has been tested to see if it causes cancer and found this to be false. “All vaccines have to undergo a series of trial phases, which last years, to check whether they cause any side effects. And no vaccines given in the UK contain enough of any chemical to be carcinogenic,” it said.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10219872714749101&set=a.1261972630252&type=3&theater,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-vaccines,https://campaigns.health.gov.au/immunisationfacts/are-vaccines-safe,https://www.tga.gov.au/,https://sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/julie-leask.html,https://www.who.int/immunization/research/committees/ivir_ac/en/index2.html,http://ausvaxsafety.org.au/about-us,http://www.ncirs.org.au/,http://www.ausvaxsafety.org.au/our-work/active-vaccine-safety-surveillance,https://www.cdc.gov/,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/tools/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvac-gen%2F6mishome.htm,https://www.science.org.au/files/userfiles/learning/documents/immunisation/immunisation-2016-low-res.pdf,https://fullfact.org/online/vaccines-cancer-studies/",No evidence to support vaccines cancer claim,,,,,,

The video included interviews with two farmers from the regional NSW towns of Bellata and Moree about their experiences during the drought. The tweet’s caption reads: “Another perspective on the drought: Feedlot operators from North West NSW, Michael in Bellata and Sandy from near Moree, explain what the drought means for them”.The Prime Minister said a video interviewing farmers was part of the government’s response to the drought.The video shows that the “necessary evil” phrase was said by Michael MacCue from Wilga Feedlot in Bellata. The full quote from Mr MacCue is: “In a way a drought’s a necessary evil. It can help cut out that bottom 10 per cent that probably shouldn’t be there anyway”.The video features a message at the end stating it is authorised by Mr Morrison. The video in Mr Morrison’s tweet was raised in Question Time in the federal parliament on September 12, 2018, when the opposition  agriculture and resources spokesman, NSW Hunter Valley-based MP Joel Fitzgibbon, asked the Prime Minister why he had  authorised and posted the video which, he said, “dismisses those farmers hurting most?”After initially stating he did not remember the video, Mr Morrison returned to the House of Representatives later the same day to respond to Mr Fitzgibbon saying: “earlier today I was asked by the member for Hunter about a post on my social media feed. He represented that this was a view that I had apparently stated.” Mr Morrison defended the video by saying the government’s response to the drought was “to go out there and listen to what people in rural and regional communities are saying to us”.“I’m not going to censor their views,” he said.Following the initial September 14, 2018 post, “Football meat pies kangaroos and Turnbull/ Abbott LIES” added an explanation in the comments section stating: “The video included comments from Michael MacCue, from the Wilga Feedlot at Bellata in the North West region of New South Wales.

Jailed their corrupt bankers. Economy is booming. Violent crime is rare. One of the lowest crime rates in the world. Atheist majority population. Where is all that evil and depravity the religious talk about?”The post has been shared more than 6200 times and attracted more than 680 comments and 10,000 reactions.The Progressive Secular Humanist Examiner’s Facebook page describes the group as providing “news, information and humor relevant to atheists, agnostics, freethinkers and secular humanists”. The Examiner’s website elaborates on its mission by stating: “More than simply negating the supernatural, Progressive Secular Humanist investigates the human condition in search of the truth. Informed by science, inspired by art, and motivated by compassion, the task is to question the world in pursuit of the good; to explore and expose inhumanity, while promoting the humane, the just, and the wise.”The group’s Facebook page has more than 437,000 likes.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck examined each claim mentioned in the post and found a mixture of true and false information. ArmyRegarding the first claim that Iceland has no army, this is true according to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), of which Iceland is a founding member. NATO’s website states: “Iceland, unique among NATO Allies, does not have a military. Icelanders have long been proud of their country’s pacifist tradition, which goes back further than its independence from Denmark in 1944.”Iceland jailed their corrupt bankersThis claim is also true. In 2015 four former bosses of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing were sentenced between four to five years in prison. Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson, Kaupthing’s former chief executive, former chairman Sigurdur Einarsson, former CEO of Kaupthing Luxembourg Magnus Gudmundsson, and Olafur Olafsson, the bank’s second largest shareholder at the time, were all sentenced. Kaupthing collapsed under heavy debts after the 2008 financial crisis. After the 2008 financial crisis, Iceland “enjoyed an economic rebound fuelled by a tourism boom”, Reuters reported in 2017. The economy is boomingThe claim of an economic boom is a mixture as it was partly true at the time of the Facebook post in 2017 and less so in 2019. A Reuters article from November 2017 said Iceland had “enjoyed an economic rebound fuelled by a tourism boom” but growth had slowed which was “a good thing”, according to chief central banker Mar Gudmundsson. Iceland’s central bank lowered its growth forecast to 3.7 per cent for 2017, Reuters reported.In September 2019, the OECD reported Iceland was hit by several export shocks during the first half of this year and its economy had turned sharply. “Revenues from tourism have almost stalled, especially after the Icelandic low-cost airline WOW went bankrupt. Seafood exports also declined as a specific specimen disappeared from the country’s fishing grounds. Over the summer, the central bank gradually lowered interest rates by one per cent percent point to 3.5 per cent. Growth is projected to reach 0.2 per cent in 2019, rebounding to 2.2 per cent in 2020.”Violent crime is rareThis claim is supported in a 2019 report by the US Department of State’s Overseas Security Advisory Council which says “Iceland has traditionally had a homicide rate of less than one per year for the last several decades”. December 2013 marked Iceland’s first fatal police shooting when officers shot and killed a man in the capital Reykjavik. An article in The Guardian on the shooting also noted that Iceland had “one of the lowest violent crime rates in the world”. The Guardian cited a 2011 Global Study on Homicide by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which found Iceland’s homicide rate never went above 1.8 per 100,000 population during the period between 1999 and 2009. One of the lowest crime rates in the worldIceland is regarded as a safe country. According to OECD data, Iceland’s homicide rate is 0.5 per 100,000 people, one of the lowest rates in the OECD.Iceland was also ranked the third least likely country to be murdered in behind Liechtenstein and Singapore, according to 2015 data by Brazilian think tank Ingrape. Ingrape’s Homicide Monitor reported just 25 people were murdered in Iceland in the period from 2000 to 2012. There were no murders in the years 2003, 2006 and 2008. Atheist majority populationMost Icelanders (80 per cent) are members of the Lutheran State Church, according to Statistics Iceland. Another five per cent are registered in other Christian denominations, including the Free Church of Iceland and the Roman Catholic Church and nearly five per cent of people practice ásatrú, the traditional Norse religion.In 2014 WIN/Gallup International released findings from a poll of 66,806 people on whether religion played a positive or negative role in their country. The most positive country in Western Europe was Iceland (43 per cent). However the North Atlantic nation ranked slightly higher than average (11 per cent) for people identifying as “a convinced atheist” (14 per cent) but this figure was far from a “majority” as claimed in the Facebook post.","https://www.facebook.com/progressivesecularhumanist/photos/a.301251116569174/1795017400525864/?type=3&theater,https://www.bluelagoon.com/day-visit/the-blue-lagoon,https://www.facebook.com/pg/progressivesecularhumanist/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/about-the-author/,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-21A87C2D-BE06D3F1/natolive/declassified_162083.htm?selectedLocale=en,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iceland-bankers/iceland-convicts-bad-bankers-and-says-other-nations-can-act-idUKKBN0LH0OC20150213,https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/welcome-to-iceland-where-bad-bankers-go-to-prison-20160401-gnvn68.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iceland-cenbank/icelands-slowing-economy-a-good-thing-central-bank-chief-says-idUSKBN1DM1GG,https://oecdecoscope.blog/2019/09/16/a-rapid-downturn-is-exposing-icelands-structural-weaknesses/,https://www.osac.gov/Country/Iceland/Content/Detail/Report/2d8cdd85-eb54-4ec7-828a-15f4aeb18469,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/iceland-armed-police-shoot-man-dead-first-time,http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/,https://homicide.igarape.org.br/,https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2015/05/13/iceland_3rd_lowest_murder_rate/,https://www.iceland.is/the-big-picture/quick-facts,https://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__menning__5_trufelog/MAN10001.px,https://www.redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Easter-Press-Release-Religion-Global-Poll.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2015/04/WIN.GALLUP-INTERNATIONAL-RELIGIOUSITY-INDEX.pdf?tid=a_inl_manual",‘Atheist’ Iceland post mixes fact and fiction,,,,,,
333,,,,Somewhat True,,2019-09-19,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/does-australia-have-close-to-90-days-of-oil-reserves/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“Well, on our definition, they’re close to 90 days and that includes stock on water, which is an important part of this.”  Federal energy Minister Angus Taylor. September 16, 2019. The AnalysisA drone attack on oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia on September 14 sent world oil prices higher and focused attention on the adequacy of Australia’s fuel reserves.Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor told ABC News Breakfast the International Energy Agency (IEA) advised him there were “ample commercial stocks” of fuel available and there was “no threat to fuel supplies in Australia”. AAP FactCheck examined Mr Taylor’s statement that Australia has close to 90 days of fuel reserves.Australia is a member country of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a signatory to a 1974 treaty that requires IEA members to hold oil reserves that will cover at least 90 days in the event of a severe oil supply disruption. Australia has not complied with the IEA’s 90-day reserve requirement since 2012.The IEA is the global energy authority which provides information on the energy sector and advocates policies to “enhance the reliability, affordability and sustainability of energy in its 30 member countries”.According to the IEA, Australia had a total of 58 days of oil stock reserves as of June 2019, the lowest among the 30 member countries.When questioned about the statement that Australia has close to 90 days’ supply, Mr Taylor’s office referred AAP FactCheck to the Department of Environment and Energy’s monthly petroleum statistics report. The report calculates petroleum stocks in different ways, including the IEA standard of “net import coverage”, also called “IEA days”, which is based on average daily imports.The report also shows how many days’ fuel supply is held on ships destined for Australia and the number of days’ supply held for the Australian market both in Australia and overseas.Mr Taylor’s calculation is based on the estimated IEA days of net import coverage plus stocks held for, and on the way to, Australia. The minister indicated this at the time of his statement, saying the calculation “includes stock on water”. Using this method Australia has averaged fuel stocks to cover 86.6 days during 2019.The Department of Environment and Energy’s Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report, released in April 2019, states that counting stock on water is not in line with IEA requirements, which do not allow countries to count stocks still being shipped towards their reserves.In an interview on ABC Radio on August 5, 2019, Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) executive director Peter Jennings said counting oil contracted or en-route for delivery may not be a viable way to ensure Australia’s fuel security in the event of an oil shortage. “I think that is really just looking at what has been contracted and if you’re in a difficult strategic situation, ships may not be able to take to sea,” Mr Jennings said.The Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report notes that there are “different ways to measure fuel stocks”.The report notes that the Australian government has committed to “returning to compliance” with IEA requirements by 2026. The government is working with the IEA over how to do this and how to possibly make reforms to those requirements. The report also says the government’s “preferred measure of domestic fuel security” is consumption cover, which counts how many days fuel stocks will last under normal demand. “Consumption cover of petrol, diesel and jet fuel has been consistent over the last decade, ranging between 17 and 20 days on average,” it says.Australia has ”the equivalent of around nine IEA days of stock in foreign ports and 20 IEA days of stock on route to Australia”, according to the report. Because those stocks are owned by Australian companies and are destined for import into Australia, it says, the IEA method used to count the 90-day stockholding “does not capture the full picture of domestic liquid fuel security, particularly as it also does not include Defence stockholdings”.Modelling of an “extreme” scenario where there are no oil imports to Australia suggests the country could support “critical users” for three months, the report says, although it states further testing is needed. The Australian Institute of Petroleum, the representative organisation for Australia’s petroleum industry, argued in a 2017 submission about a new petroleum data reporting regime that not counting on-water stocks gave an incomplete picture of how much petroleum was available to the domestic market. On-water stocks represent about a quarter of Australia’s total fuel inventory, the AIP said. Dr Paul Barnes, head of risk and resilience at ASPI, told AAP FactCheck in an email that “including stocks at sea and not yet in Australia does not comply with the detail laid out in the IEA’s compliance regime about having reserves to address surprises and contingencies”.The Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report states that there are “a number of questions about exactly how Australia’s liquid fuel market would work in the case of major disruptions” and further modelling and testing “will provide the information that the Government requires to make sound decisions on how to manage the risks in”. Deakin University Law School Professor of Law Samantha Hepburn told AAP FactCheck that Australia should not count on-water supplies towards IEA stocks “because we don’t have full control of our fuel stocks on international waters until it is on our soil”.Professor Hepburn also said the purpose of the IEA’s 90 day fuel stock is to ensure there is a sufficient global stockpile for “a collective response in the event of a massive fuel disruption”.“If you don’t have 90 days of reserves, excluding on-water stocks, Australia would be unable to contribute to the global response in the event of a fuel shortage and this would undermine global security,” Prof Hepburn said. Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck finds that Mr Taylor’s statement is mostly accurate: based on his stated measure of including on-water stocks being shipped to Australia, the nation’s fuel reserves are close to 90 days’ cover. However, Australia’s fuel reserves currently do not meet the 90 days’ cover required under its commitment to the IEA international energy program treaty. Energy security experts have expressed concern about counting on-water stocks in fuel reserves. The Liquid Fuel Security Review interim report states that early modelling suggests critical users could be supported for three months if Australia could not receive oil imports but also states that a number of questions remain about what would happen in a major disruption.","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-16/oil-prices-expected-to-jump-more-than-10pc-on-saudi-attack/11515350,https://minister.environment.gov.au/taylor/news/2019/interview-michael-rowland-abc-news-breakfast,https://www.energy.gov.au/government-priorities/international-activity/international-energy-agency-iea-program-treaty,https://www.iea.org/about/ourmission/,https://www.iea.org/netimports/,https://www.energy.gov.au/publications/australian-petroleum-statistics-2019,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/consultations/7cf6f8e2-fef0-479e-b2dd-3c1d87efb637/files/liquid-fuel-security-review-interim-report.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/pm/petrol-rationing-a-real-risk-if-persian-gulf-tensions-continue/11384942,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/consultations/7cf6f8e2-fef0-479e-b2dd-3c1d87efb637/files/liquid-fuel-security-review-interim-report.pdf,https://www.energy.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3411/f/petrol-other-fuels-reporting-submission-aust-institute-petrol-2017.pdf,https://www.aspi.org.au/bio/paul-barnes,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/consultations/7cf6f8e2-fef0-479e-b2dd-3c1d87efb637/files/liquid-fuel-security-review-interim-report.pdf,https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/samantha-hepburn",Does Australia have close to 90 days of oil reserves?,,,,,,

The page’s stated aim is to “share with like minded people the joy of simplicity”.The post has been shared more than 50 times and attracted more than 130 reactions and two comments. The AnalysisAbraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States, holding power from 1861 to 1865. He  oversaw the prosecution of the American Civil War and freed the nation’s slaves. Lincoln’s second term as president ended upon his assassination and death in Washington on April 14, 1865. The purported Lincoln quote was debunked after Illinois Governor Bruce Runner used it during an address on cutting taxes and boosting spending in 2018. Runner used the quote to illustrate his point and was corrected by several experts on Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States, holding power from 1861 to 1865.The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum said there was no evidence of Lincoln saying those words. Library and museum spokesman Chris Wills said: “The quote about creating the future has been attributed to Lincoln for decades, and while there is no hard proof he ever said it, the sentiment certainly matches other things president Lincoln is documented to have said”. The co-director of Lincoln Studies Center in Galesburg, Rodney Davis, told the Illinois Public Media website willradio.tv.online that he did not recognise the quote.  A spokesperson for Governor Runner later acknowledged the quote was not by Lincoln and said “next time, we will certainly check with Lincoln scholars!”Harold Holzer, a Lincoln scholar and former chairman of the Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation, told AAP FactCheck in an email that the quote’s origins were not from Lincoln. Holzer is co-chairman of The Lincoln Forum and has written numerous books on the former president, including The Annotated Lincoln (2016), President Lincoln Assassinated! (2015) and Lincoln: How Abraham Lincoln Ended Slavery in America (2013). The quote’s origin has been variously attributed to two Nobel Prize winners, Ilya Prigogine and Dennis Gabor and to US management consultant and author Peter Drucker. Gabor, who won the Nobel prize for physics in 1971, wrote in his 1963 book, Inventing the Future: “The future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented.” Prigogne said: “The way to cope with the future is to create it” and Drucker has been widely credited with saying: “You cannot predict the future, but you can create it.” Drucker’s quote came from his book, Drucker on Leadership: New Lessons from the Father of Modern Management (2009).","https://www.facebook.com/1621072678108035/photos/a.1621076068107696/2398012160414079/?type=3&theater,https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/abraham-lincoln/,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Becoming-Minimalist-Australia-1621072678108035/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/abraham-lincoln/,https://will.illinois.edu/news/story/land-of-lincoln-governor-goofs-honest-abe-quote,http://lincolnlibraryandmuseum.com/,http://www.haroldholzer.com/,https://www.thelincolnforum.org/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1977/summary/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1971/gabor/facts/,https://www.drucker.institute/perspective/about-peter-drucker/,https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2235041,https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/28241137",‘Best way to predict your future’ quote has no link to Lincoln,,,,,,

September 13, 2019. The AnalysisThe Tasmanian government’s leader of the house, Michael Ferguson, says 10,000 jobs were lost under the Labor-Green minority government that held power in the island state until the Liberals took power in 2014.The claim that there were “10,000 jobs lost under the last Labor-Green government” has also been made this year by federal senator for Tasmania Richard Colbeck. AAP FactCheck has examined the claim.From 2010 to 2014, Tasmania was led by a Labor-Greens minority government, with Labor leader David Bartlett serving as premier until 2011, when Lara Giddings took up the role.The Labor Party’s 16-year reign in Tasmania came to an end at the 2014 election when Will Hodgman led the Liberals into government.Mr Hodgman also led the Liberal Party to victory at the March 2018 election against a Labor Party led by current Opposition leader Rebecca White.Mr Ferguson is Tasmania’s Minister for State Growth, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Science and Technology and Leader of the House.A Liberal government spokesman referred AAP FactCheck to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data as the source of the claim. ABS trend series data shows there were 240,100 employed people in February 2011 and 230,000 in October 2013.“Hence over the two and a half year period, between February 2011 and October 2013, 10,100 jobs were lost,” the spokesman said.The spokesman also pointed out that the ABS data shows that, during the period in question, 9,500 of the jobs lost were full-time jobs.It is correct, therefore, that at one point during the Labor-Greens government 10,000 jobs were lost, however there were increases in job numbers before and after the period to which the Tasmanian Liberal government is pointing.Between April, 2010, when the Labor-Greens government began, and February, 2011, the total number of jobs in Tasmania rose by 1,800, while full-time jobs rose by 1,700. [7]Following the drop in job numbers between February, 2011 and October, 2013, total job numbers rose by 5,800 by the end of the Labor-Greens government in April 2014. Full-time job numbers recovered by 4,300 in the same period. [7]Looking at the total period of the Labor-Greens government, ABS figures show 238,300 total jobs in Tasmania in April 2010, dropping to 235,800 by April 2014.This makes for a net loss of 2,500 total jobs during the term of the Labor-Greens minority government.Looking at the same ABS figures for full-time jobs only, there were 155,000 full-time employees in Tasmania in April 2010 and 151,500 in April 2014, making for a loss of 3,500 full-time jobs under the Labor-Greens government.Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Ferguson’s reference to 10,000 jobs being lost “under the last Labor-Green government” to be somewhat true. Jobs were lost under the Tasmanian Labor-Greens government between 2010 and 2014 and it is accurate that, during one period during that government’s term, 10,000 jobs were lost.However, the number of jobs lost between the start and finish of the Labor-Greens government in Tasmania is 2500 in total, or 3500 if counting full-time jobs only.","https://www.themercury.com.au/news/politics/labor-announces-shadow-cabinet-reshuffle-after-departure-of-scott-bacon/news-story/367fba2a9164c13e5f5a412827c9aeb4,https://www.examiner.com.au/story/6128183/better-tasmanian-jobs-news-but-a-long-way-to-go-yet/?cs=12,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-16/tasmania27s-labor-green-alliance-under-the-microscope/5203722,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/15/labor-swept-from-power-in-tasmania-after-16-years-in-government,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-03/counting-underway-in-tasmanian-election/9443530,https://www.tas.liberal.org.au/our-team/michael-ferguson,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6202.0Jul%202019?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6202.0Jul%202019?OpenDocument","Were 10,000 jobs lost in Tasmania under the Labor-Greens government that held power from 2010 to 2014?",,,,,,

September 12, 2019. The AnalysisHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says the long-running case of the Tamil asylum-seeker family facing deportation is costing Australian taxpayers “literally millions of dollars” . Sri Lankan couple Nadesalingam, known as Nades, and Priya came separately to Australia in 2012 and 2013 respectively by boat before marrying in 2014, having two children and settling in the Queensland town of Biloela. In March 2018 the family was taken into a detention centre in Melbourne after the Department of Home Affairs found they did not have a legitimate case for obtaining refugee status in Australia.  The family’s bid to have this decision reviewed in relation to the mother and eldest child failed in the Federal Circuit Court, and they subsequently lost their appeal against this outcome last December.The family is currently in detention on Christmas Island as the Federal Court decides whether the youngest child is eligible for protection in Australia. Mr Dutton told 2GB radio in an interview the family’s father had travelled from Australia while his matter was still before the courts. The minister went on to say he had travelled to Qatar, Kuwait and back to Sri Lanka. AAP FactCheck examined the Home Affairs Minister’s claim that the father in the Biloela case had left Australia while his case was before the courts to travel to Qatar, Kuwait and Sri Lanka.A media release from supporters of the family challenged the minister’s claim. Simone Cameron, listed as a family friend and former Biloela resident, said: “the conditions of Nades’ visa prevented him from leaving and then returning to Australia”.“After arriving in Australia in 2012, Nades was issued a bridging visa that did not allow him to exit and return to Australia, making what Mr Dutton says untrue and simply impossible – the Minister should know that,” Ms Cameron said. The release also stated: “Between 2004 and 2011, Nades applied for temporary work visas to travel to Qatar and Kuwait. He returned to Sri Lanka to fulfil family responsibilities during periods of relative calm. He believed that the danger had died down and tried to stay safe by avoiding the Sri Lankan authorities.”According to June 2018 court documents, Nades claimed he was forced to join the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in 2001 and was harassed by the Sri Lankan military, the ABC reported on September 2, 2019. Nades frequently travelled between Sri Lanka, Kuwait and Qatar between 2004 and 2010 for work, during the civil war that ended in 2009. Ms Cameron told AAP FactCheck that Nades travelled to Qatar from June 17, 2004 to September 25, 2008, to Kuwait from November 2, 2008 to January 25, 2010 and to Sri Lanka from December 9, 2010 to May 23, 2011.“Nades refutes the claim totally that he has left Australia since his arrival in 2012,” Ms Cameron said.Immigration lawyer Carina Ford, who has acted for members of the family, told AAP FactCheck that following the minister’s comment, she had sought and received confirmation from Nades, through intermediaries on Christmas Island, that he had not travelled out of Australia since arriving in 2012.Ms Ford also said the conditions of the visa Nades was on was unlikely to have been one that would allow him to leave Australia and return.Principal solicitor and manager of the Human Rights Law Program at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Carolyn Graydon, told AAP FactCheck the only visa that would allow someone seeking asylum to leave Australia and return is a Bridging Visa B.“Someone would have to arrive by plane and they would have to hold a visitor visa or some other kind of valid visa and apply for protection while they still held that visa, before it expired,” Ms Graydon said.A spokesperson for the Home Affairs minister told AAP FactCheck that Mr Dutton was referring to the father travelling to Qatar, Kuwait and Sri Lanka before he came to Australia.Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found the minister’s claim to be false. The minister’s office later told AAP FactCheck that Mr Dutton’s quote was referring to before Nades came to Australia, rather than while he was living in the country as stated in the 2GB interview.","https://www.2gb.com/peter-dutton-backs-gladys-liu-after-bad-day-at-the-office/,https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/6364908/what-happens-next-to-the-biloela-family/?cs=7479,https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2018/2018fca2103,https://www.2gb.com/peter-dutton-backs-gladys-liu-after-bad-day-at-the-office/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-02/biloela-tamil-family-melbourne-federal-circuit-court-hearing/1146887,https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/bridging-visa-b-020#About",Did the father of a Tamil asylum seeker family travel from Australia while his immigration case was before the courts?,,,,,,

Founded in 2012, the page has more than 12,000 likes. The AnalysisThen-Social Services Minister Scott Morrison gave a speech at the Australian Council of Social Service (‘ACOSS’) on June 26, 2015, detailing his desire for the private sector to invest more in the welfare system.In this speech Mr Morrison said: “What I am basically saying is that welfare must become a good deal for investors – for private investors. We have to make it a good deal – for the returns to be there, to attract the level of capital that will be necessary in addition to the significant injection of capital and resources that is already provided by States and the Commonwealth.”Prime Minister Scott Morrison in parliament in 2019.Later in the speech Mr Morrison touched on “social impact bonds”.“Social Impact Bonds allow us to extend the financial risk of funding and delivering social services from the public sector to include the private sector. Taxpayers’ money is spent only on successful programmes and outcomes, as it should be,” he said.The June 29, 2015 SMH article by Rachel Browne, the URL for which appears in the post, paraphrased Mr Morrison’s line about welfare becoming a “good deal” for private investors.  The post featured a slightly edited version of the original line from Mr Morrison’s speech, omitting the first mention of “investors” to become “Welfare must become a good deal for private investors”.However, the second clause of the quotation: “… allow us to shift services from the government sector to the private sector” is not found in either the SMH story or the full transcript of Mr Morrison’s ACOSS speech. Nor can it be found in ABC radio journalist Louise Yaxley’s coverage of the speech on the PM program.The line appears to be an alteration of Mr Morrison’s statement regarding social impact bonds, which is listed  above.AAP FactCheck found that the earliest version of the line used in the Liberal Ideology post appears in the comments section of a story published on independent media website The Australian Independent Media Network on June 5, 2017.A user called “silkworm” commented:“… Morrison gave the game away in 2015 when he said, ‘Welfare must become a good deal for private investors…. allow us to shift services from the government sector to the private sector.’”This user included a link to a story published on June 26, 2015 (the day of Mr Morrison’s ACOSS speech) by Pro Bono Australia, which is a news, jobs, research and funding resource for the not-for-profit and charity sector.However, the Pro Bono Australia story does not contain the quotation in question.This purported quote appeared in another AIM story published on December 13, 2017.This story attributed the quote to Scott Morrison and dated it to June 26, 2015, but provided no source.","https://www.facebook.com/libideology/photos/a.659900810741412/2547550395309768/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/libideology/about/?ref=page_internal,https://formerministers.dss.gov.au/15806/a-good-deal-on-welfare-address-to-acoss-national-conference/,https://www.acoss.org.au/,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-calls-on-private-sector-to-invest-more-in-welfare-20150626-ghyb8q.html,https://formerministers.dss.gov.au/15806/a-good-deal-on-welfare-address-to-acoss-national-conference/,http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4262765.htm,https://theaimn.com/alan-tudge-met-protests-welfare-card/,https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2015/06/private-capital-investment-needed-to-expand-welfare-system-morrison/,https://probonoaustralia.com.au/,https://theaimn.com/government-opposition-get-act-together-work-people-australia/",Scott Morrison “private sector” welfare quote not accurate,,,,,,

He was also a theologian who wrote many books on Christianity.The quote attributed to Lewis in the post appears in the book, “The Misquotable C S Lewis: What He Didn’t Say, What He Actually Said, and Why It Matters” by William O’Flaherty.C S Lewis is best known for writing classic fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia. “While Lewis believed in encouraging others his published writings do not contain any statement similar to this. His general style of writing is very different than this cliché-like expression,” an excerpt of the book reads, which was published on the site Essential C S Lewis, also run by O’Flaherty.The quote is also included in the C S Lewis Foundation’s list of “Quotes Misattributed to C S Lewis” which states that “due to the nature of the internet and social media, many of these quotes started out attributed to their proper author/speaker, but were soon falsely attributed to C.S.

340,,,,Mixture,,2019-09-06,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/snake-venom-can-move-despite-entirely-accurate-experts/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“The only way that the venom can get into your blood stream [sic] is to be moved from the bite site in the lymphatic vessels. The only way to do this is to physically move the limbs that were bitten…Venom can’t move if the victim doesn’t move.” AAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from August 28, 2019 by an Australian user which features a range of guidelines about how to deal with snakebites. The user reposted an entry #SnakeBite originally published by Queensland-based nurse education provider ECT4Health on November 7, 2018. ECT4Health’s statement that “venom can’t move if the victim doesn’t move” was made in the context of a series of instructions relating to pressure immobilisation bandaging.It also stated: “In the 1980s a technique called Pressure immobilisation bandaging was developed to further retard venom movement. It completely stops venom /lymph transport toward the blood stream [sic].”The original post has been shared more than 16,000 times, generating more than 5000 reactions and 3300 comments.The AnalysisECT4Health’s claim venom transport in the lymphatic system is entirely passive is “not necessarily” true, according to the University of Melbourne’s toxinology expert Dr Timothy Jackson.Dr Jackson, who heads the venoms and antivenoms reference laboratory at the university’s Australian Venom Research Unit, said the post’s assertion was based on the same hypothesis as the pressure immobilisation (PIB) first aid technique for snake bite. He said PIB is based on the theory that venom is initially injected into the lymphatic system and needs to travel to lymph nodes in order to enter the bloodstream.“Thus pressure restricts the lymphatic flow (without cutting off blood flow) and immobilisation slows down the passive flow (the lymphatic system has no “pump” of its own),” Dr Jackson told AAP FactCheck in an email response to questions. He said this hypothesis is “somewhat true” and why PIB “seems to work…or at least makes intuitive sense.” It is, however, based on little research evidence, according to Dr Jackson.“Transport of toxins by the lymphatic system, as well as their entry into the blood – ‘toxin biodistribution’ more broadly – is almost entirely unstudied,” he said.Dr Jackson says experts believe some toxins – very small molecules – could bypass the lymph nodes altogether and drain through capillaries straight into circulation. “Staying still will not prevent these toxins reaching the bloodstream. We also don’t know what degree of pressure or immobilisation is required to completely prevent transport, and we don’t know if these states are achievable without compromising the health of the bite patient in other ways.“Staying still is definitely good, as is applying a compression bandage. But I would not endorse the assertion that this completely prevents toxicity.”University of Queensland venom expert Dr Bryan Fry agrees. He said proper application of the pressure-immobilisation protocol for snakebite first-aid will greatly slow down the spread of venom and “dramatically delay the onset of life-threatening symptoms”, but would not stop it immediately.ECT4Health managing director Rob Timmings, the author of the original post, told AAP FactCheck the group’s page offered general information intended for nurses and paramedics that was meant to provoke discussion. “As far as writing is concerned, the style is humorous, conversational, and learned, but not academic… the editing is deliberately loose and tabloid in nature,” he said. “That said, the information is correct, and an interpretation of what is known on the topic at the time. Many papers from the academic, clinical and social literature were used to inform the content, and exact statements in the post were paraphrased from colleagues and a wide range of sources, rather than quoted (where a reference would always be used).”Mr Timmings said the experts contacted by AAP FactCheck were correct in clarifying two claims made in the Facebook post. First, he clarified that “staying still won’t completely retard venom transport”, but would “significantly slow the venom entering the lymphatic system which uses limb muscle movement rather than blood pressure to move “. “Like the veins, lymph vessels have one-way valves inside them.  For this reason, any slight movement ensures a one-way non refluxing passage of venom toward the person’s heart.  For this reason, my post was perhaps a bit over dramatic at getting that point across,” Mr Trimmings said. The ECT4Health post also claimed there are only “five genus”, or kinds, of Australian snakes – “browns, blacks, adders, tigers and taipans” that will “seriously” harm people. Dr Fry, an associate professor at UQ’s School of Biological Sciences, said. “Those five (snakes) mentioned are the most commonly responsible for life-threatening envenomations but far from the only ones capable of such severe effects.”Mr Timmings clarified there are more than five kinds of venomous snakes in Australia – including whips, copperheads and sea snakes. He said these snakes are the “only terrestrial snakes in Australia to have caused death” and for which they are antivenoms available by vaccine company, CSL Sequiris.","https://www.facebook.com/Ect4Health/posts/1237289243078941,https://biomedicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/departments/pharmacology/engage/avru/about-us/our-staff,https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/540,https://www.ect4health.com.au/about-us/,https://www.seqirus.com.au/docs/208/442/Polyvalent%20Snake%20Antivenom%20-%20approved%20Product%20Information%20v6_26%20Oct%202016.pdf",Snake venom can move despite entirely accurate: experts,,,,,,

The post purports to list a range of new Queensland driving offences and the penalties that apply in each case. It  features an image of a Victoria Police officer handing a driver’s licence to another Victoria Police officer inside a vehicle.A Facebook post from June 28, 2019 features a purported list of new Queensland driving offences and the penalties.  The post’s caption reads: “New Road rules in QLD” – serious – be careful out there… / They kept these quiet, didn’t they???… / NEW Qld Road Rules as of now!!!… / $256 + 0 points Driving with person or animal on lap / $44 + 0 points Reversing for longer than necessary / $256 + 1 point Following another vehicle too closely / $256 + 0 points Driving without a clear view in all directions / $66 + 2 points Driving in right-hand lane of a multi-lane road with an 80km/h or higher limit / $44 + 0 points Entering an intersection when the road beyond is blocked / $44 + 0 points Parking/stopping within 10m of an intersection without a traffic light / $88 + 0 points Making a U-turn at an intersection controlled by lights / $198 + 3 points Making a U-turn across a single or double continuous line / $352 + 2 points Playing loud music / $66 + 0 points Tooting the horn / $330 + 3 points Using mobile phone including use by cyclists / $44 + 0 points Leaving vehicle without handbrake left on / Having Sat Nav in an impeding position – supposed to be in bottom right hand in front of driver (My understanding is that must not be in the area where the windscreen wipers Sweep) / Failing to have a hand on the steering wheel while stopped at lights”. Capricorn Coast Gardening Buy, Trade, Sell is a public Facebook group which describes itself as “a place for Central Coast Qld to trade their fresh produce and anything gardening related”. The post had been shared more than 4600 times and attracted more than 900 reactions. The AnalysisAAP FactCheck examined each road rule mentioned in the post and found that all the rules do exist under current legislation. However AAP FactCheck has also confirmed that the rules have been in place for more than 10 years: having entered into force in Queensland’s  Transport Operations (Road Use Management – Road Rules) Regulation 2009. A spokesperson for the TMR confirmed to AAP FactCheck that “all of the offences are currently listed under the Queensland Road Rules and have been covered by various transport regulations for some time”. The Facebook post claims a satellite navigation unit is supposed to be in the bottom right hand corner of a windscreen. While the offences listed were correct, the monetary penalties shown for each offence are inaccurate, with the TMR confirming they don’t reflect current rates. “They are not new offences. Only the current penalties are out of date,” the spokesperson said. “This Facebook content has been posted regularly over recent years.” There are also inaccuracies in some of the claimed offences. For example, while the post claims a “Sat Nav” or satellite navigation unit is supposed to be in the bottom right hand corner of a windscreen, the Queensland legislation makes no mention of a specific area where such devices must be placed. The actual rule states: “A driver must not drive a motor vehicle unless the driver has a clear view of the road, and traffic, ahead, behind and to each side of the driver”.The Facebook post also claims drivers “making a U-turn at an intersection controlled by lights” would incur and $88 fine but no demerit points. Queensland rules actually impose a two demerit point penalty.In another claim, the post says “playing loud music” will incur a $352 fine and lose two demerit points. However AAP FactCheck confirmed that Queensland road rules do not have a specified offence of “playing loud music”.The regulation states: “A person must not start a vehicle, or drive a vehicle, in a way that makes unnecessary noise or smoke; or wilfully start a vehicle, or drive a vehicle, in a way that makes unnecessary noise or smoke”.The TMR spokesperson said the actual offence “covers more than just playing loud music while starting or driving a vehicle”. “It includes making unnecessary noise or smoke by the way the vehicle is started or driven,” the spokesperson said.Yet another misleading claim is that road rules cover a driver “failing to have a hand” on the steering wheel while stopped at traffic lights. Once again, the legislation makes no mention of such a requirement.“Regarding the rule about hands on the steering wheel, a driver has to have proper control of the vehicle,” the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck. “Whether a single hand on the steering wheel would constitute an offence is a matter for the Queensland Police Service to determine, who enforces the road rules.”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2912596665423536&set=gm.2371177889873058&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1487922414865281/?tn-str=*F,https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/2017-08-25/sl-2009-0194",“New” Queensland road rules post makes a wrong turn,,,,,,

August 30, 2019. The AnalysisAustralia’s latest greenhouse gas emissions scorecard was released on August 30, 2019, showing a slight increase in emissions for the year to March, 2019.The report, from the Department of the Environment and Energy, states that the increase in emissions was “primarily due to increased LNG exports”, which rose 18.8 per cent during the period. LNG, or liquefied natural gas, is a major Australia export commodity, worth $50 billion in 2018-19. Gas for export is produced from gas fields in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Gas production causes fugitive emissions of methane, which is a more intensive greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.As Australia’s gas production increased, fugitive emissions from gas production has increased. In the year to March, 2019, a 5.9 per cent rise in fugitive emissions was driven by a 15.4 per cent rise in natural gas production, according to the department report.In announcing the latest quarterly greenhouse gas inventory update on August 30, federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said: “We are seeing a reduction in emissions as a result of Australia’s gas exports, but we have to wear a small increase (in domestic emissions) as a result of it.”A media statement issued by Mr Taylor on the same day said: “Australia’s LNG exports for the year to March 2019 are estimated to be worth $47.8 billion and have the potential to reduce global emissions by up to 152 Mt (million tonnes) CO2-e, or up to 28 per cent of Australia’s annual emissions.”AAP FactCheck contacted the minister’s office seeking the evidence that supported the assertion that “we are seeing a reduction in emissions as a result of Australia’s gas exports”.AAP FactCheck also sought clarification of how the figure of 152 Mt CO2-e (million tonnes of carbon-dioxide-equivalent gas) was calculated.Mr Taylor’s office cited internal Department of the Environment and Energy calculations, based on National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting standards, for the 152 Mt CO2-e figure. The calculations compared the carbon emissions from burning the 71.4 million tonnes of LNG exported by Australia in the year to March, 2019 with the emissions that would have resulted from burning black coal to generate the same amount of energy.Those calculations showed emissions from LNG combustion of 202.43Mt CO2-e and emissions from energy-equivalent coal combustion of 354.46Mt CO2-e, yielding a difference of 152Mt CO2-e.However the minister’s office did not provide information that shows that Australia’s export gas is replacing coal in the importing countries. Mr Taylor’s office also did not provide information that supports the statement that there is an observable reduction in global emissions as a result of Australia’s gas exports.The minister’s August 30 press release referred to a recent CSIRO report that found substituting gas for coal in electricity generation produces a substantial greenhouse gas emissions saving of up to 50 per cent.The CSIRO research, also cited in the March greenhouse gas inventory quarterly update, compared emissions from using gas and coal to generate electricity in Queensland and found a 31 to 50 per cent emissions reduction from gas. The CSIRO report states “considerable climate benefits are possible where natural gas replaced coal for electricity generation; particularly in developing countries.” However, the CSIRO report also stated that “climate benefits or dis-benefits of natural gas depend on whether displacement of renewable sources of energy by gas occurs; such as under scenarios where cheap abundant natural gas displaced more expensive renewable and nuclear electricity generation”.The report also states: “In the present study, we cannot calculate directly the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction of LNG exports from Curtis Island, Queensland, relative to coal-fired electricity generation in Asia because we do not know the proportion of gas used to displace what would have been produced from coal.”Separately, the International Energy Agency states that gas, alongside renewable and nuclear energy, has helped limit global emissions since 2010 and that gas “where it replaces more polluting fuels … also reduces air pollution and limits emissions of carbon dioxide”. In China, Australia’s second biggest export market, demand for gas has grown strongly in recent years, with gas consumption rising 18 per cent in 2018, faster than the increase in coal consumption of 0.9 per cent, according to the BP Statistical Review 2019. However China’s emissions still rose by 2.2 per cent in 2018, faster than the 0.5 per cent annual growth in emissions over the previous five years.Director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, Professor Frank Jotzo, questioned the claim that Australia’s gas exports are reducing global emissions when Mr Taylor made a similar statement in June, at the time of the release of the December 2018 quarterly greenhouse inventory report. In an article co-authored with Crawford School of Public Policy research manager Salim Mazouz, Prof Jotzo said Australian gas “displaces a mix of energy sources, including gas from other exporters”. “Whether and to what extent Australian gas exports reduce emissions therefore remains unclear,” Prof Jotzo and Mr Mazouz wrote. [10]When contacted by AAP FactCheck, Prof Jotzo said there has been no change to his view since the article was written in June.Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found it is not possible to determine whether Australian gas exports are leading to reductions in global emissions. While using gas to replace coal in energy generation is shown to reduce emissions, there is no available evidence to show the extent to which Australian-sourced gas is being used by importing countries to replace coal-fired power.","https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-nggi-mar-2019,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/6686d48f-3f9c-448d-a1b7-7e410fe4f376/files/nggi-quarterly-update-mar-2019.pdf,https://publications.industry.gov.au/publications/resourcesandenergyquarterlyjune2019/documents/Resources-and-Energy-Quarterly-June-2019.pdf,https://gisera.csiro.au/factsheet/fugitive-methane-emissions-factsheet/,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/6686d48f-3f9c-448d-a1b7-7e410fe4f376/files/nggi-quarterly-update-mar-2019.pdf,https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6358121/australias-emissions-continue-to-rise/?cs=14231,https://minister.environment.gov.au/taylor/news/2019/australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-march-2019-quarterly-update-released,https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GISERA_G2_Final_Report-whole-of-life-GHG-assessment.pdf,https://www.iea.org/publications/roleofgas/,https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2019-china-insights.pdf,https://theconversation.com/australias-energy-exports-increase-global-greenhouse-emissions-not-decrease-them-118990,https://minister.environment.gov.au/taylor/news/2019/australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-december-2018-quarterly-report,https://theconversation.com/australias-energy-exports-increase-global-greenhouse-emissions-not-decrease-them-118990",Has there been a reduction in global carbon emissions as a result of Australia’s gas exports?,,,,,,

It is time to rid this nation of their STUPIDITY”. The post has been shared more than 300 times and attracted more than 400 reactions and 20 comments. The AnalysisGlaciers form when snow and ice accumulates in one location for a prolonged period and forms a thickened ice mass, according to the US-based National Snow and Ice Data Center. Due to their mass, glaciers have the ability to move under their own weight. According to the Center, glaciers currently occupy 10 per cent of the world’s land area store 69 per cent of the world’s fresh water.Al Gore was born in 1948 and served in the US Congress from 1977-1993 before becoming vice president from 1993-2001. His post-political career has involved environmental activism and his work on global warming saw him awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.Regarding the unsourced claim there were 130,000 glaciers when Mr Gore was born, there is no comprehensive record of the number of glaciers worldwide at that time. A 2018 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report on Global Glacier Changes states that the first attempt to compile a world glacier inventory was made in the 1970s “based mainly on aerial photographs and maps” and that it continues today “based mainly on satellite images”.  A 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report supported this information by stating that “most of the new (glacier) data sets, along with a globally complete glacier inventory, have been derived from satellite remote sensing”. William Colgan, a senior researcher with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, went further and told PolitiFact: “We just don’t have the snapshots from space in 1948.” The World Glacier Inventory (WGI), established in 1989, does currently contain records of more than 130,000 glaciers however it is an incomplete record. A 2009 paper on completing the WGI says that as of 2008 there were more than 95,000 glaciers that needed to be inventoried. For the claim there are 130,000 glaciers today, there are a range of estimates. Australia’s national science agency CSIRO told AAP FactCheck there were several publications with figures including the Working Group I contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, which states on page 335 that “the current best estimate is around 170,000 (glaciers) covering a total area of about 730,000 km2”. More recently a report by the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Geoscience in February 2019 stated that there were “about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets”, based on a Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0 technical report. World Glacier Monitoring Service director Wilfried Haeberli noted in the UNEP report that “glaciers worldwide have been shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions around the 1920s and 1970s, and again increasing rates of ice loss since the mid 1980s”. The World Glacier Monitoring Service noted in a report that “glaciers worldwide have been shrinking significantly”.","https://www.facebook.com/TheGreensLittleBagofStupidity/photos/a.821287754573654/2414253458610401/?type=3&theater,https://www.algore.com/about,https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheGreensLittleBagofStupidity/about/?ref=page_internal,https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/what.html,https://www.biography.com/political-figure/al-gore,https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7789/-Global%20Glacier%20Changes_%20facts%20and%20figures-2008825.pdf?sequence=3&amp%3BisAllowed=,https://www.ipcc.ch/,https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter04_FINAL.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/apr/02/viral-image/viral-meme-about-al-gore-and-glaciers-wrong/,https://nsidc.org/data/G01130,http://www.glims.net/glacierdata/data/lit_ref_files/ohmura2009.pdf,https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter04_FINAL.pdf,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0300-3,http://www.glims.org/RGI/randolph60.html,http://www.glims.org/RGI/00_rgi60_TechnicalNote.pdf,https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7789/-Global%20Glacier%20Changes_%20facts%20and%20figures-2008825.pdf?sequence=3&amp%3BisAllowed=",Al Gore glaciers post melts under scrutiny,,,,,,

Make sure to enjoy it hot, so that it can help warm up your cold, dead heart.”The July 12, 2019 post, by an Australian user, has been shared more than 24,000 times and attracted 12 comments.The AnalysisCampbell Soup Company is an American food and drinks multinational that was founded in 1869. The company’s canned soup featured in an iconic artwork created by artist Andy Warhol in 1962.In 2015, Campbell’s launched an advertisement campaign in collaboration with the J.J Abrams-directed Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Campbell’s Soup confirmed to US fact checkers Snopes that the “Customer Service” account wasn’t theirs.The advertisement featured two fathers feeding their young son Campbell’s soup while impersonating Darth Vader’s famous ‘I am your father’ line from 1980’s Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.The Campbell’s advertisement ends with the line, “Made for real, real life.”When unveiling the new advertising campaign in 2015, Campbell’s vice president of marketing Yin Woon said the company wanted to “show actual families, which means families of different configurations, cultures, races and life choices.”The advertising campaign attracted criticism from some socially conservative groups and customers upset at the use of a same-sex couple.One criticism came from Kim Spears Cook, whose comment on Campbell’s Facebook wall: “Your new commercial with the 2 dads makes me sick” was met with the response from “Customer Service”.“Customer Service”, which featured Warhol’s Campbell’s soup artwork as its profile picture, that Kim might try “a delicious can of Campbell’s Chicken Noodle Soup” if feeling sick. The response ended with: “Make sure to enjoy it hot, so that it can help warm up your cold, dead heart.”American fact-check organisation Snopes confirmed in November 2015 that Campbell’s had no connection to the ‘Customer Service’ account, which Snopes revealed was run by comedians Ben Palmer and Nick Price. In an email to Snopes, Campbell’s confirmed that “the Facebook account shown in the screen grab is not connected to Campbell’s Soup in any way.”Additionally, Campbell’s does not have a separate Facebook account to respond to online comments or complaints and instead responds directly from the verified “Campbell’s” account.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157064829055353&set=a.10150181610000353&type=3&theater,https://www.campbells.com/,https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans-1962/,https://time.com/4068363/campbells-soup-star-wars-gay-dads-father-ad/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/,https://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/newsroom/news/2015/10/05/campbells-new-portfolio-advertising-campaign-celebrates-real-life-moments/,https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/one-million-moms-campbells_n_56181dc1e4b0dbb8000e9e79,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/campbells-customer-service-facebook/,https://www.facebook.com/campbells/?epa=SEARCH_BOX",Campbell’s Soup “Customer Service” reply is fake,,,,,,

Rescue Photo of one of the animals that threw themselves into the water trying to save themselves from the Amazon fire”.The post had been shared more than 120 times and attracted more than 15 comments and 80 reactions.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck traced the photo of the Brazilian soldier and the jaguar to Brazilian photographer, None Manguiera, who first posted the image to her Facebook page in March 2016.In a photo series posted to her Facebook album titled, “Jiquitaia”, None Mangueira explained the jaguar’s name was Jiquitaia from the Amazon jungle, and it was “found abandoned from the parents during an army military operation in the municipality of Tefé-am”, according to a translated version of the caption.Smoke rising from fires in the Amazon rainforest, in the Brazilian state of Para on August 23, 2019.In another photo of the same male soldier and Jiquitaia, the caption refers to the jaguar as “Jiquiataia” and the soldier as “Amazon Military Command”.The Brazilian army, also known as the Jaguars, has a division which looks after the Amazon region called the Amazon Military Command. The Amazon Military Command was formed in October 1956 as a measure to deal with “border protection … and … the problem of repression of smuggling”.In June 2016, None Mangueira posted another photo of the same male soldier and jaguar with the caption translated from Portugese reading, “Abuse of image. This is Jiquitaia, not Juma. They entered my face(book), used my photos of a beautiful preservation project, with inappropriate and biased subtitles without the knowledge of cause. Here’s an alert for us photographers about the bad faith of third parties. Protect your projects, protect your images!Help me spread the truth!”“Juma” referred to in the post was another jaguar that was shot dead after it escaped its handlers during the Olympic torch relay in Brazil ahead of the Rio Olympics in 2016. Massive fires have been burning in the Amazon rainforest for weeks, during the season of the “queimada”, or burn, in which 2500 new fires were lit in 48 hours.The fires were thought to have peaked after August 10, 2019, when farmers reportedly set a large area of the forest on fire to show Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro their willingness to work and increase areas for pasture, according to a translated page on the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPF) in Pará.The MPF is tasked with “defending social and individual rights, defending legal order and defending Brazil’s democratic regime”.The MPF quoted one of the organisers of the burn who told the newspaper Folha do Progresso, “we need to show the president that we want to work and the only way is to knock it down. And to form and clean our pastures, it is with fire”.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2680879405278901&set=a.456264277740436&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/nonemangueira/photos/a.1045162945567811/1045163005567805/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/nonemangueira/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1045162945567811&ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/nonemangueira/photos/a.607135686037208/1106678322749606/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/nonemangueira/photos/a.1045162945567811/1045162992234473/?type=3&theater,http://www.cma.eb.mil.br/home/missao-e-valores.html,http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Atos/decretos/1956/D40179.html,https://www.facebook.com/nonemangueira/photos/a.607135686037208/1121113397972765/?type=3&theater,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-22/rio-2016-jaguar-used-in-olympic-torch-event-killed-in-brazil/7531676,https://lens.monash.edu/@medicine-health/2019/08/26/1376257/have-we-reached-the-first-tipping-point-for-runaway-climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/brazil-amazon-fire-day-warning,http://www.mpf.mp.br/pa/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-pa/mpf-apura-aumento-no-desmatamento-e-nas-queimadas-na-floresta-amazonica-em-investigacoes-em-santarem-itaituba-altamira-e-belem,http://www.mpf.mp.br/o-mpf/sobre-o-mpf/sobre-o-mpf-1,http://www.folhadoprogresso.com.br/dia-do-fogo-produtores-planejam-data-para-queimada-na-regiao/",Photo of soldier and jaguar not related to Amazon fires,,,,,,

August 27, 2019.  The AnalysisHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says there has been a sharp rise in the number of asylum seekers in offshore detention centres self-harming in an attempt to gain access to Australia. AAP FactCheck examined the minister’s claim there has been a 130 per cent rise in self-harm incidents since the so-called Medevac bill took effect on March 1, 2019.Mr Dutton’s office clarified to AAP FactCheck that the minister’s quote referred to the percentage rise in incidents from March 2018 to March this year.Introduced to the House of Representatives on December 3, 2018 by crossbenchers Kerryn Phelps, Andrew Wilkie, Adam Bandt, Julia Banks and Rebekha Sharkie, the Migration Amendment (Urgent Medical Treatment) Bill, known as the Medevac bill, allows detainees to be transferred to Australia for medical treatment if two or more registered doctors recommend they be transferred. The Home Affairs minister has 24 hours to approve or reject an application based on security concerns.The ability to transfer sick detainees was already available under existing laws before the Medevac bill. A group of public servants on the Transitory Persons Committee within the Home Affairs department would meet regularly to assess the needs of asylum seekers seeking urgent medical care. The new law meant doctors’ diagnoses – not the decisions of the public servants – would trigger medical transfers. The bill was passed in parliament on February 13, 2019 with amendments to the Migration Act 1958. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs told AAP FactCheck that in March this year there were 60 incidents of “self-harm and threats of self-harm across both PNG and Nauru”. The spokesperson said that in March 2018 there were 26 incidents of self-harm “threatened and actual”, an increase of 130 per cent.AAP FactCheck asked the department to provide an explanation of how the figures were compiled or the data source for the statistics but received no response at the time of publication.AAP FactCheck noted that in a submission to the Senate Standing Committee set up in July to inquire into proposed amendments to the Medevac legislation, Home Affairs stated that there had been “an upwards trend” in the number of self-harm related incidents among asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea since late 2018. The submission stated that 58 people transferred to Australia under the Miscellaneous Measures Act because of an act of self-harm or threat of self-harm since the implementation of the Act. AAP FactCheck concludes that while Home Affairs provided figures to support Mr Dutton’s claim, there is no source available to verify how the 130 per cent increase was determined.","https://www.2gb.com/peter-dutton-medevac-laws-have-caused-dramatic-increase-in-self-harm-cases/,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/billsdgs/6491896/upload_binary/6491896.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-12/asylum-seeker-medical-evacuation-bill-what-next/10802918,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6069,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/RepairMedicaltransfers/Submissions",Has the number of self-harm incidents by people in offshore detention increased by 130 per cent since the Medevac law?,,,,,,

The image is accompanied by text that reads: “1969…cabling at the Woodstock Festival.”A Facebook post from August 17, 2018 shows a tangle of cables and purports to be a photo taken at Woodstock.The post has been shared more than 27,000 times and attracted more than 2600 reactions and 170 comments.The AnalysisThe Woodstock Festival was held over three days in August 1969 at a dairy farm in Bethel, New York and became “synonymous with the counterculture movement of the 1960s”. Among the acts who performed were Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Santana, The Grateful Dead and Sly and The Family Stone.Woodstock was plagued by problems, among them was the weather and the outdoor stage, according to author Joel Makower. English singer and musician Peter Gabriel on stage in Zurich in 2002.“The conditions were suboptimal to say the least,” he told the website History. “There were electrical wires going under the mud and the ground was vibrating.”AAP FactCheck examined the image of the cabling and noted that it is taken in a venue with tiered seating. Among the comments on the Facebook post, one commenter debunked the photo, claiming it was taken during a 1994 tour by English singer Peter Gabriel. The photo was also labelled “fake news” by UK lighting professional Rob Sayer.AAP FactCheck traced the photo to Gabriel’s Secret World Live album which was released in August 1994. The album featured 15 songs from the singer’s Secret World Tour of 1993-94 and the artwork receiving a Grammy Award nomination in 1994 for the Best Record Sleeve Packaging Design, according to the Rockapedia website.The album was packaged with a colour booklet featuring photos from the tour. On one double page is a composite picture featuring eight small performance images at the top and two large images below. The large image on the left is the cabling photo which the Facebook post claimed was from Woodstock in 1969. In the Facebook image there is a box with “48X51” on the side and the same figures appear in the photo featured in the Peter Gabriel album booklet.Michael Coulson, who was involved with the album’s art direction, told AAP FactCheck in a statement the photo was taken by Stephen Lovell-Davis at the Hamburg Sporthalle in Germany on April 16, 1993. Mr Coulson said Mr Lovell-Davis shot many of the images featured in the booklet and owns the copyright to the cabling image. The image is visible on the Discogs website by clicking the “More images” link on the page for the Secret World album.

The ABC is funded by the people and should be for all the people, not a percentage of the people”.The post had been shared more than 3200 times and attracted more than 120 comments and 370 reactions.The AnalysisThe Facebook post did not include a reference for the claimed power station statistics.AAP FactCheck identified the same statistics – excluding those claimed for Australia – in an infographic accompanying an article published on July 3, 2017 on “Watts Up With That?”, a website that claims to be the “world’s most viewed website on climate”. The site’s founder and editor, Anthony Watts, describes himself as “a former (American Meteorological Society) AMS Television Seal Holder television meteorologist who spent 25 years on the air and who also operates a weather technology and content business, as well as continues daily forecasting on radio, just for fun”. The Liddell power station in NSW is one of 21 coal-fired plants currently operating in Australia.The infographic accompanies the article titled “Forget Paris: 1600 New Coal Power Plants Built Around The World”. While the infographic does not include any statistics for Australia, according to a report, “Retirement of coal-fired power stations” released by the Australian federal Senate Environment and Communications References Committee in March, 2017, there were 24 coal-fired power stations in operation in Australia in 2017. (Chapter 2, Section 2.5)As of 2019, Australia has 21 active coal-fired power plants, according to data compiled by the  Australian Energy Council. The Australian Energy Council is a body which represents major electricity and downstream natural gas businesses operating in wholesale and retail energy markets.Australia’s operating coal-fired power stations. (Source: ElectricityGasAustralia 2019, Australian Energy Council)The Watts Up With That article featured an excerpt of the first nine paragraphs from a New York Times (NYT) article from July 1, 2017 and linked at the end to the full NYT article. The NYT article covers a 2017 report by a German environmental organisation, Urgewald, about planned coal-fired power station construction in China. AAP FactCheck did not find a version of the infographic in the NYT article.  The earliest incidence of the infographic found by AAP FactCheck is in UK newspaper The Times on December 2, 2015, alongside an article reporting that more than 2,400 new coal-fired plants are planned or under construction worldwide. The Times article cites a report, Climate Action Tracker, compiled by four groups: Ecofys, NewClimate Institute, Climate Analytics and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Sunday Times science and environment editor Jonathan Leake tweeted a link to the graphic on December 6, 2015.The Times infographic’s sources are listed as the Global Coal Plant Tracker, which is published by US-based research and advocacy group Global Energy Monitor (formerly CoalSwarm), and Platts World Electric Power Plants database (WEPP). The Global Coal Plant Tracker is a database with statistics on coal-fired power generation around the world. Platts WEPP is described as an inventory of electric power generating units.The infographic lists power stations under the categories “Existing” and “Planned”. AAP FactCheck could not identify the source of the data for “Existing” power stations. The numbers listed under “Planned” correspond to a table in the Climate Action Tracker report (see page 9) showing the number of plants planned for each country as of 2015.However, the Climate Action Tracker report notes (see page 2) that its figure of 2,440 planned coal-fired power plants globally is based on a count of plants that are “announced”, “in pre-permit phase”, “permitted” and “under construction”.The report also notes (see page 4) that “not all planned capacity will be constructed”.A 2018 report, “Boom and Bust, Tracking the global coal plant pipeline” by CoalSwarm (now Global Energy Monitor), The Sierra Club and Greenpeace, states that there were declines globally in announced, pre-permit, permitted and under construction coal-fired energy capacity between January 2016 and January 2018. According to the Boom and Bust report (see page 4), new announcements fell 64 per cent in megawatts (MW) terms during the period, pre-permit stage projects fell 61 per cent in MW terms, permitted projects fell by 38 per cent in MW terms and projects under construction fell 38 per cent in MW terms.  Total coal-fired power projects operating rose four per cent in MW terms in the period, the report said.","https://www.facebook.com/GetOurABCBack/photos/a.581454735246441/2413704425354787/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/GetOurABCBack/about/?ref=page_internal,https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/07/03/forget-paris-1600-new-coal-power-plants-built-around-the-world/,https://wattsupwiththat.com/about2/,https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/07/03/forget-paris-1600-new-coal-power-plants-built-around-the-world/,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Coal_fired_power_stations,https://www.energycouncil.com.au/about/,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/climate/china-energy-companies-coal-plants-climate-change.html?smid=tw-share&login=email&auth=login-email,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/2500-new-coal-plants-will-thwart-any-paris-pledges-ctx3t7thnf7,https://web.archive.org/web/20151224064918/https://climateactiontracker.org/assets/publications/briefing_papers/CAT_Coal_Gap_Briefing_COP21.pdf,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVOOs0wWUAAgbZA.jpg,https://globalenergymonitor.org/coal/global-coal-plant-tracker/,https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/products-services/electric-power/world-electric-power-plants-database,https://endcoal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BoomAndBust_2018_r6.pdf",Worldwide coal plants claim is inaccurate,,,,,,
351,,,,False,,2019-08-23,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/fluoride-ingredient-claim-in-prozac-is-false/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement AAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from August 8, 2019 by No Fluoride Australia which features an image of a large pill capsule in a wooded area with the words “Prozac” and “1,000,000 mg”  printed on it. A sign that reads “Don’t worry — be happy” appears over the top of the pill. A Facebook post from August 8, 2019 claims fluoride is the main ingredient in Prozac and that it makes users apathetic. The caption on the image reads, “Fluoride is the main ingredient in Prozac for a reason, it makes you apathetic, your problems don’t go away, you just no longer care about them…water fluoridation is mass medication.”No Fluoride Australia has more than 16,000 page likes and claims their aim is “raising awareness surrounding the important issue of water fluoridation, and the toxic industrial waste products being used in this harmful program”.The post had been shared more than 150 times and attracted more than 15 comments and 120 reactions. The AnalysisProzac is a prescription-based drug used to treat major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The ingredients in a Prozac capsule include 20mg of fluoxetine, maize starch, dimethicone 350, gelatin, iron oxide yellow CI77492, patent blue V CI42051, titanium dioxide and edible black ink, according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The Australian Dental Association says the claim that fluoride is the main ingredient in Prozac is “simply scaremongering nonsense”. Fluoride is not the main ingredient in Prozac, according to the Campaign for Better Health. Fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac, is made up of 18.5 per cent of fluoride and the remaining 81.5 per cent of the drug is comprised of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. The Campaign for Better Health is a program by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which involves a broad network of oral health advocates, health professionals, child and family organisations, and scientists who aim to “ensure that more children get the basic dental care they need to grow, learn, and lead healthy lives”. Professor Malcolm Hopwood, a former Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) president told AAP FactCheck while “there may be very small amounts of fluoride in the tablet” it was “definitely not a main constituent”. The RANZCP is “responsible for training, educating and representing psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who are specialists in the treatment of mental illness”.The Australian Dental Association (ADA) supported Prof Hopwood’s claim, advising AAP FactCheck “the claim, very widely spread by anti-fluoridation activists, that ‘fluoride is the main ingredient in Prozac’ is simply scaremongering nonsense”. “In short, fluorine is added to many drug molecules because it makes them more effective and safer. It’s a good thing, not a bad thing,” an ADA spokesperson said.“Our communities readily accept chlorination and the addition of folic acid, thiamine and iodised salt to bread – they’re every bit as much ‘mass medication’ as water fluoridation is – as simple, sensible, and highly effective public health measures, and so is water fluoridation. Fluorides are very common in the earth’s crust, and they’re naturally found in almost all water supplies, foods etc. All the constituent particles are already in the water naturally. There’s nothing being added to the water that’s not already in the water.”According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the US federal public health agency, fluorine is a pale yellow-green gas with a sharp odour. It combines with metals to make fluorides such as sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride, both white solids.  The ADA is Australia’s “peak national body for dentists. A voluntary member organisation with branches in every state and territory”. The association aims “to support members by enhancing their ability to provide safe, high quality professional oral health care; encourage the improvement of the oral and general health of the public, and promote the ethics, art and science of dentistry”. Prozac works by blocking the absorption of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Regulating the amount of serotonin helps brain cells transmit messages to each other. This results in a better and more stable mood.  Regarding the effects of Prozac, Prof Hopwood told AAP FactCheck that “apathy is not a noted side effect of fluoxetine, in fact, the more common effect is activation – people are more alert, rather than sedated and apathetic.” Other common side effects of Prozac include “feeling sick (nausea), headaches, trouble sleeping, diarrhoea and feeling tired or weak,” according to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). These are usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks”, the NHS says.","https://www.facebook.com/nofluorideaustralia/photos/a.342122975921809/1603709853096442/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/nofluorideaustralia/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/medicines/brand/amt,2954011000036108/prozac#downloads,https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2010-CMI-04102-3&d=201908221016933,https://ilikemyteeth.org/fibbing-fluoride/,https://ilikemyteeth.org/about/,https://www.ranzcp.org/about-us/about-the-college/our-history/presidents-of-the-college/malcolm-hopwood,https://www.ranzcp.org/about-us/about-the-college,https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/,https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts11.pdf,https://www.ada.org.au/About,https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2010-CMI-04102-3&d=201908221016933,https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/fluoxetine-prozac/",Fluoride ingredient claim in Prozac is false,,,,,,

August 22, 2019. The AnalysisAs federal Health Minister Greg Hunt consults on ways to stem the tide of Australians dropping their private health insurance due to rising premiums, Private Healthcare Australia chief executive Rachel David says the industry’s hands are largely tied by the cost of medical devices. AAP FactCheck examined Ms David’s claim that cardiac stents cost five times more in Australia than in New Zealand.Ms David’s office told AAP FactCheck her claim relied on a comparison between the cost difference of a specific commonly used brand of permanent cardiac stent, available in both Australia and New Zealand.Heart stents are tiny wire mesh tubes used to prop open narrowed or blocked arteries. There are two types – bare metal stents, and drug-eluting stents which are coated with drugs that help keep the artery open.In New Zealand, the most commonly used drug-eluting stents – accounting for 65 per cent of the market – are from Abbott Laboratories Australasia’s Alpine and Xpedition ranges. The Xpedition stent costs $NZ525 ($A495) and the Alpine stent costs $NZ750 ($A707). Bare metal stents by various brands cost between $NZ250 ($A236) and $NZ465 ($A440).In Australia, the cost of heart stents is mandated by the federal government, through the Prostheses List, which sets the benefit amount private insurers must pay for medical devices. Australian private health funds pay $898 for a bare metal stent regardless of brand, and $2484 for drug-eluting stents including the Abbott Laboratories Australasia’s Alpine and Xpedition ranges.The Xpedition stent costs five times more for an Australian health fund than the same device costs in New Zealand. The Alpine stent is 3.5 times more expensive in Australia, and the bare metal stent is two to 3.8 times pricier.Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Ms David’s claim to be mostly true. One specific kind of commonly used stent – the Xpedition stent by Abbott Laboratories – is five times more expensive in Australia than New Zealand. The minor problem is that other stents are between two and 3.8 times more expensive.","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/remove-rugs-from-aged-care-to-reduce-health-insurance-costs-report-says-20190820-p52itv.html,https://www.heart.org/-/media/data-import/downloadables/pe-abh-what-is-a-stent-ucm_300452.pdf,https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/hospital-devices/categories/drug-eluting-stents/,https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/schedule-addendum-devices-2019-09.pdf,https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/69F6A026037D6093CA257BF0001B5EDA/$File/Prostheses%20List%20-%20Part%20A%20(Rules%202019).pdf",Do heart stents cost Australian private health funds five times more than they cost in NZ?,,,,,,

What you do is punch in your pin # (sic) backwards. When you do that, the money will come out but will be stuck in the slot. The machine will immediately alert the local police without the robbers (sic) knowledge and begin taking photos of the suspect. Every ATM has the feature. Stay safe.”The ‘When something exciting happens I randomly slap the person next to me’ page is followed by more than 203,000 people and has attracted more than 240,000 likes since it was created in 2014. The page, which displays no details in its description, appears to mainly share memes. The AnalysisThe ATM reverse PIN claim has been circulating on the internet since at least 2006, according to fact checking outlet Snopes, which debunked a meme with the same picture.  A PIN scheme such as the one described in the post, named SafetyPIN, was created in 1998 by Chicago businessman Joseph Zingher. However, Zingher’s idea didn’t interest banks and US state governments.The same ATM “tip” has been investigated by up to 10 fact checking services which all found it to be false.The US government’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported in 2010 that “FTC staff learned that emergency-PIN technologies have never been deployed at any ATMs”.Zingher’s time, money and efforts proved fruitless. He spent so much money on pushing his “invention” he ended up broke and was forced to move in with his brother, according to a CNN report.   Three of Australia’s four biggest banks – the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, and NAB – all confirmed to AAP FactCheck that their ATMs have no such system in place.CBA and NAB told AAP FactCheck the post is “false”. An ANZ spokesperson said it was a “good story but unfortunately it is not true. In fact, if a customer tried this three times the ATM would retain their card”. AusPayNet, a payments industry body, also told AAP FactCheck the PIN claim was false and the Australian Bankers’ Association issued a warning in 2011: “The PIN has only one function – to allow the customer to access their account – and it must be entered correctly each time and kept confidential. If a customer enters a PIN in reverse they will receive an error message and be prompted to provide the correct PIN.” Queensland Police shared their warning in 2013. The claim has also been debunked by Politifact, Business Insider, UK news outlet Metro and The North Wales Police Department, among others.","https://www.facebook.com/somethingexciting/photos/a.1407743149485922/2126712690922294/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/somethingexciting/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/reverse-pin-atm-alarm/?fbclid=IwAR2XiDbbeWo_JiqMqjOwcPnVvu9LAm25pNrPh8hy7FLxLhlnWvUa44vwls8,http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4086277/ns/business-forbes_com/t/banking-atm-safety/#.XVy_YiMzaUk,https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-economics-staff-report-emergency-technology-use-atms-pursuant-credit/100504creditcardreport.pdf,https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2006/02/01/8368177/index.htm,https://web.archive.org/web/20120318083132/http://www.bankers.asn.au/ArticleDocuments/192/ABA-111075-v1-Fact_Sheet___False_information_on_e-mail_about_PINs.PDF.aspx,https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/2013/12/16/false-information-circulating-reverse-pins/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/mar/26/facebook-posts/entering-atm-pin-backwards-wont-call-police/,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/viral-facebook-post-emergency-advice-atm-robbery-is-dangerous-untrue-2018-2?r=US&IR=T,https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/27/does-entering-your-pin-backwards-at-an-atm-summon-the-police-6737938/,https://www.north-wales.police.uk/advice-and-support/cyber-crime/pin-reversal-hoax",ATM reverse PIN claim is false,,,,,,

Truth Seeker. The group’s aims are “Seeking Truth and Awareness in the areas of 5G, Anarchy, the Ruling Elite, Personal Sovereignty, OBE, Lucid Dreaming & NDE’s, Artificial Intelligence, Basic Universal Income, the Hero’s Journey, Psychedelics, Spirituality, Hidden History & Relationships”. The post generated 10 reactions and four shares. The purported Socrates quote has been widely shared on Facebook, including the groups Mind Core which has more than 3.3 million followers and The Intellectualist, a society and culture page with more than 373,000 followers. The AnalysisSocrates lived in Athens in the 5th century BC and was the first Greek philosopher to seriously explore questions of ethics. Born to a stonemason and a midwife, Socrates introduced the concept that “virtue is knowledge” but left no written records. Most of what survives was recorded by his student, the philosopher Plato, the historian Xenophon and Plato’s student, Aristotle, the philosopher and scientist.Professor Rick Benitez from the University of Sydney’s Department of Philosophy and Department of Classics and Ancient History told AAP FactCheck in a statement the quote “does not appear in any of the direct evidence we have for Socrates”. Greek philosopher Socrates left no written records. Most of what survives was recorded by his student, the philosopher Plato.Prof Benitez said the quote was not found in the dialogues of Plato or the works of Xenophon that feature Socrates. “It bears a vague resemblance to some things that Plato’s Socrates says in the Gorgias about the different methods of the philosopher and the rhetorician, but there is no direct reference to losing a debate, or to the losers using slander. There is only the general claim that philosophers use arguments and rhetoricians use persuasion (slander, not mentioned, being one technique of persuasion).”Prof Benitez did a check of Plato’s uses of διαβολή (diabolē) and λοιδορία (loidoria) – the two most common Ancient Greek words for slander – and there was “nothing approaching” the purported quote in “anything Plato’s Socrates says”. According to fact checking units Snopes, Politifact, Metabunk, Truth or Fiction, and CheckYourFact, the quote does not appear anywhere in Socrates’ speeches or writings. Truth or Fiction claimed the first iteration of the quote being attributed to Socrates was in May 2006 from a personal website.

Before you react, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try.”Nagle Catholic College describes itself as a “Catholic, co-educational secondary school established in 1994 to serve the needs of families in the Mid-West region WA”.The post has attracted 13 reactions and two shares and Nagle Catholic College’s Facebook page has more than 1900 followers.The AnalysisAuthor and journalist Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) is one of America’s literary greats, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Hemingway’s best-known novels include The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), Death in The Afternoon (1932) For Whom The Bell Tolls (1940) and The Old Man and The Sea (1952). The post attributing the quote to Hemingway carries no reference to when or where the Nobel Prize winner is supposed to have said or wrote it. James Hutchisson, a professor of American literature at The Citadel, a military college in South Carolina said it was “very unlikely” the quote was from Hemingway. “Never seen it before,” he told the US fact check service, CheckYourFact, in May 2019.Two experts on Hemingway have said there is no evidence the writer uttered the attributed quote.Hemingway biographer Mary V Dearborn went further, saying she was “almost 100 per cent sure” the quote was not by Hemingway. “Doesn’t sound at all like him, either stylistically or substantively,” she said. “He’d never advise praying, for one thing. In fact, I think he’d sooner die than endorse something this conservative and, well, passive. He was far more proactive, even rash. Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead.”The purported Hemingway quote also bears similarities to a Facebook post from July 31, 2018 featuring an image of English writer William Shakespeare. The post contained a quote attributed to Shakespeare and included the lines “ … Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray. Forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live”. AAP FactCheck found the quote attributed to the Bard to be false. The second part of the quote was attributed to American poet William Arthur Ward from a poem titled, “Before You”. The poem reads, “….before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save.

The page has over 60,000 likes. The post had been shared more than 160 times and attracted more than 10 comments and 300 reactions.The AnalysisWinston Churchill was a decorated statesman, politician, orator and author who led the British army to victory in World War II under his prime ministership. Researchers who studied his life told AAP FactCheck the quote attributed to 1953 Nobel Prize winner in the post was not accurate.Lee Pollock, interim executive director at The International Churchill Society told AAP FactCheck the quote was “a catchy phrase attributed (like many others) to Churchill but there is no evidence he ever said it”.The National Churchill Museum says there is no record of Winston Churchill “writing or ever saying” the quote attributed to him.The International Churchill Society, based in Washington DC, describes itself as “the world’s pre-eminent member organisation dedicated to preserving the historic legacy of Sir Winston Churchill”. Timothy Riley, Sandra L. and Monroe E. Trout director and chief Curator of the National Churchill Museum, told AAP FactCheck that “in the great many speeches, articles, books and addresses by Churchill, there is no record of Churchill writing or ever saying this”.“If these words were uttered, it is unlikely they came from Churchill, at least based on his own experience,” Mr Riley said. “At 20 Churchill was full of ambition and was very aware of how others perceived him. At 40, after he was forced to resign as First Lord of the Admiralty after the failed Dardanelles campaign in World War I, he cared deeply about what others thought as he defended his actions in the wake of a disastrous military defeat.In his mid 60s, he was prime minister leading Britain during its most challenging hour as his nation stood alone against a formidable and terrible Nazi threat. The quote in question is not only not by Churchill, it isn’t Churchill either.” The National Churchill Museum is based on the campus of Westminster College in Missouri and “commemorates and celebrates the life, times, and distinguished career of Sir Winston Churchill”. AAP FactCheck searched for the quote in the International Churchill Society quotes archive and the “50 Sir Winston Churchill Quotes to Live By” collated by BBC America, but could not find any evidence linking him to the quote. Richard Langworth, a senior fellow with the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, published a list of “All the “Quotes” Winston Churchill Never Said (1)” and included the attributed quote on the list.","https://www.facebook.com/GoldCoastCommunityPage/photos/a.148399221895350/2060405357361384/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/GoldCoastCommunityPage/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/GoldCoastCommunityPage/photos/a.148399221895350/2060405357361384/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winston-Churchill,https://winstonchurchill.org/about/about-the-society/,https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/about-the-winston-churchill-museum.html,https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/,http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/04/50-churchill-quotes,https://richardlangworth.com/quotes-churchill-never-said-1",No evidence to link Churchill to caring about what people think quote,,,,,,

If (New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda) Ardern was serious about addressing “climate change” shouldn’t she start by culling the entire sheep population of NZ?” One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts. August 14, 2019. The AnalysisOne Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts says New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern should consider culling all of her country’s methane-producing sheep before criticising the Australian government on emissions and climate change. [1]Ms Ardern has drawn the ire of conservative figures, including broadcaster Alan Jones, after saying Australia “has to answer to the Pacific” on its emissions reductions at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu which ran from August 13 to 16. [2] [3]AAP FactCheck examined Mr Roberts’ claim that New Zealand has 60 million sheep, each producing 30 litres of methane each day.According to New Zealand’s official data agency, Stats NZ, the most recent farm census was conducted in 2017 and recorded 27.5 million sheep in the country. A provisional update in June 2018 recorded a 200,000 drop in the number of sheep, to 27.3 million. According to CSIRO senior technician Andrew Toovey, sheep produce between 25 and 30 litres of methane – a greenhouse gas – each day. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Australia also claims sheep produce 30 litres of methane per day. New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas inventory for 2017, released in April 2019, showed sheep produced 12.7 per cent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Dairy cattle accounted for 22.5 per cent, while electricity generation created 4.4 per cent. In 2019 New Zealand introduced a bill to reduce emissions of methane by animals to 10 per cent below 2017 levels by 2030, and between 24 and 47 per cent below 2017 levels by 2050.In 2017, New Zealand emitted the equivalent of about 80.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Australia emitted 534.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Based on the above evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Roberts’ claim to be ambiguous. New Zealand has less than half the number of sheep Mr Roberts claimed it did, but sheep do produce between 25 and 30 litres of methane each day.","https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/strewth/bridget-mckenzies-staffer-delivering-results/news-story/493562d7872360d9ae9c6623e9fe46a8,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/alan-jones-doubles-down-on-criticism-of-jacinda-ardern/11420102,https://www.forumsec.org/pacific-islands-forum-leaders-meeting-2019-media-and-information-accreditation/,https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/livestock-numbers,https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/agricultural-production-statistics-june-2018-final,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2015-12-22/collecting-sheep-gas-emissions-in-inflatable-tunnel/7047808,https://www.peta.org.au/issues/clothing/cruelty-wool/environmental-hazards-wool-production/,https://theconversation.com/nz-introduces-groundbreaking-zero-carbon-bill-including-targets-for-agricultural-methane-116724,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/zero-carbon-amendment-bill,https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/nz-greenhouse-gas-inventory-2019.pdf,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/29eca947-af49-4ed1-8369-e68d74730cf9/files/national-inventory-report-2017-volume-1.pdf","Does New Zealand have 60 million sheep, each producing 30 litres of methane daily?",,,,,,

One point I would make is 65 per cent of Australia’s coal exports are metallurgical coal – coal for steelmaking – and at the moment there isn’t another way of making steel in industrial quantities in the world without using coking coal.” Pat Conroy, federal opposition spokesperson on International Development and the Pacific and spokesperson on climate change. August 13, 2019. The AnalysisFederal opposition spokesperson on International Development and the Pacific Pat Conroy stated during an interview on ABC Radio National that 65 per cent of Australia’s coal exports are metallurgical coal.AAP FactCheck examined the NSW MP’s claim that the majority of Australia’s coal exports are metallurgical coal. Australia exports metallurgical and thermal coal. Metallurgical, or coking, coal, is an essential input for making steel. Thermal coal is burned for electricity generation. [2][3]Mr Conroy spoke on ABC radio about the call from Pacific island nations for Australia to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. He said Australia is not responsible for the emissions of coal it exports but must do more to reduce domestic emissions. [1]Mr Conroy also stated that those calling for a ban on Australian coal exports are referring to thermal coal. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal by volume, exporting approximately 372 million tonnes of coal in 2017, according to figures from the Minerals Council of Australia. Approximately 200 million tonnes of that was thermal coal and 172 million tonnes was metallurgical coal. Accordingly, AAP FactCheck calculated that metallurgical coal exports made up 46 per cent of Australia’s coal exports in 2017. According to the June 2019 Resources and Energy Quarterly report from the Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australia is forecast to export an estimated 188 million tonnes of metallurgical coal and 210 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2019-20. AAP FactCheck calculated that metallurgical coal therefore accounts for 47.2 per cent of forecast coal exports by volume and thermal coal accounts for 52.8 per cent of forecast exports by volume. [4]When contacted by AAP FactCheck, a spokesperson for Mr Conroy referred to the June 2019 Resources and Energy Quarterly report and stated that the 65 per cent figure was a reference to the value of metallurgical coal exports. This is correct: the report lists the forecast value of metallurgical coal exports for 2019-20 as $39 billion and the forecast value of thermal coal exports as $21 billion. AAP FactCheck calculated that the value of metallurgical coal exports in this forecast period accounts for 65 per cent of the value of Australia’s coal exports.Australia’s exports of coal have been a focus of negotiations at the Pacific Islands Forum held in Tuvalu from August 13 to 16, 2019. Low-lying Pacific islands are vulnerable to rising sea levels resulting from climate change and Pacific leaders have been increasingly vocal about the need for developed nations, including Australia, to reduce emissions.Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga has called on Australia to cut emissions “including not opening your coal mines”. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose 1.7 per cent to a historic high of 33.1 gigatonnes of CO2 in 2018. The IEA said coal-fired power plants were the single largest contributor to the growth in emissions in 2018. Coal-fired electricity generation accounted for 30 per cent of global CO2 emissions in 2018, the IEA said, with the majority of that generation found in Asia.Based on the available evidence, AAP FactCheck finds the claim that 65 per cent of Australia’s coal exports are metallurgical coal to be misleading without the clarification that this is when measured by value. While metallurgical coal accounts for 65 per cent of forecast exports in 2019/20 by value, it accounts for 47.2 per cent of the volume of forecast coal exports for the same period. Thermal coal accounts for 52.8 per cent of the volume of coal Australia’s forecast exports for the period and 35 per cent of the value.","https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/tuvalu-pm-says-foreign-aid-money-no-good-without-climate-action/11411124,https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/180615%20MCA%20Thermal%20Coal%20Outlook%20Study.pdf,https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/181012%20Commodity%20Insights%20Met%20Coal%20Report.pdf,https://publications.industry.gov.au/publications/resourcesandenergyquarterlyjune2019/documents/Resources-and-Energy-Quarterly-June-2019.pdf,https://unfccc.int/news/global-sea-level-rise-is-accelerating-study,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-13/australias-climate-funding-pacific-islands-forum-tuvalu/11408930,https://www.iea.org/geco/emissions/",Does metallurgical coal comprise 65 per cent of Australia’s coal exports?,,,,,,
359,,,,False,,2019-08-16,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/figures-for-2019-mass-shootings-list-inconsistent/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from August 4, 2019 by Pauline Hanson’s – One Neuron – Please Don’t Explain which features a tweet posted on the same day by The Spectator Index. The tweet lists the number of mass shootings in 12 countries in 2019, including in the United States, Mexico, Canada, The Netherlands and Australia.A Facebook post from August 4, 2019 shows a screenshot of a list of the number of mass shootings that occurred around the world since the year began.The post, titled “Mass shootings, 2019.”, lists the US with 249 mass shootings, Mexico three, Canada, Brazil and The Netherlands with one each while Germany, Italy, the UK, Australia, Spain, Saudi Arabia and France had none.Pauline Hanson’s – One Neuron – Please Don’t Explain describes itself as a “satirical page” which aims to highlight “the dumbest flock of voters following the dumbest politician since the word dumb was invented” and find “the truth about the frauds of One Neuron”.The post’s caption, “So when is Pauline going to ask for the banning of white guys coming into Australia?” is satirical, however, the post itself was taken from The Spectator Index, a website that collates statistical information on “politics, economics, history, military affairs, sports, science and technology” from various sources and distributes the information online.The post had been shared more than 40 times and attracted more than 70 comments and 170 reactions. Variations of the post had been shared on Facebook by LGBTI Rights Australia, American rapper T.I. and the Martin Luther King memorial, The King Centre. On Twitter it was posted by former US soccer player Taylor Twellman and drag artist Dusty Ray Bottoms. The AnalysisThe information for US mass shootings was sourced from Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which describes itself as an “independent research and data collection organization to provide comprehensive data for the national conversation regarding gun violence”. Figures for mass shootings in other countries on the list had no sources attributed to them.GVA’s measure for categorising a mass shooting is “four or more shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location not including the shooter”. These include “officer-involved shootings, accidental shootings, children shooting themselves, murders, armed robberies, familicide, mass shootings, defensive gun use, Home Invasions, drivebys and everything else”.A shooting in Darwin on June 4, 2019 saw four people killed and one person injured after a man opened fire in multiple locations around the city.Under GVA’s measure, the US had 249 mass shootings from January 1, 2019 to August 4, 2019, but Australia would also have at least two mass shootings in the same period: a Melbourne nightclub shooting on April 14 that killed two people and injured four others and a shooting in Darwin on June 4 where four people were killed and one was injured.AAP FactCheck applied the same criteria to the number of mass shootings in Mexico. Based on a count using information from available news reports, AAP FactCheck found the number of shootings rose to more than 13 incidents with at least four deaths and/or injuries from January 1, 2019 to August 4, 2019. These included the La Playa nightclub shooting in Salamanca where 15 people died and four were injured, a bar shooting in Minatitlan which killed 13 people and injured four, the San Luis Potosi club shooting where two people were killed and two more were injured, and the La Kuka club shooting in Cancun which killed five people and injured another five.The Spectator Index posted two versions of the mass shootings tweet on their Twitter page, one at 7.58am which indicated The Netherlands had no mass shootings in 2019 and an updated version at 8.23am which included the mass shooting in Utrecht in March 2019, which was used in the Facebook post.While other variations of the post included the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, the post by Pauline Hanson’s – One Neuron – Please Don’t Explain taken from The Spectator Index did not. The Christchurch attacks at two mosques on March 15 killed 51 people.According to the RAND Gun Policy in America Initiative, a policy and research think tank, there is no official definition as to what constitutes a mass shooting. Media organisations reporting on mass shootings generally refer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) definition of a mass murderer as someone who “kills four or more people in a single incident (not including himself), typically in a single location”. The RAND Corporation states it is a public policy research organisation. Mother Jones, a US investigative news magazine which collates mass shootings in the US, classifies a mass shooting as a perpetrator taking at least four lives. In 2013, the US government revised this down to three fatalities and this figure was adopted by Mother Jones research. Mother Jones also takes into account killings carried out by a lone shooter and in a public place. Crimes primarily related to gang activity or armed robbery were not included, nor were mass killings that took place in private homes. Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim tallies. Mother Jones also included in its count a handful of cases also categorised as “spree killings” in circumstances where the event took place over multiple locations but still fits the criteria.Under Mother Jones’ measure, Australia would have no mass shootings in 2019 as stated in the post, but the US figure would be revised down to seven.","https://www.facebook.com/PaulineHansonsOneNeuron/photos/a.1420592737956634/2878723222143571/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/PaulineHansonsOneNeuron/about/?ref=page_internal,https://spectatorindex.com/,https://www.facebook.com/pg/spectatorindex/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/EMRAUST/photos/a.10152035005655516/10157261808430516/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/TI/photos/a.10152054879667849/10156500819192849/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/thekingcenter/photos/a.10151748973723933/10157824230713933/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/TaylorTwellman/status/1157987045027078145,https://twitter.com/DustyRayBottoms/status/1157854822240071680,https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology,https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology,https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting?year=2019,https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/revenge-attack-suspected-motive-in-love-machine-double-murder-20190510-p51m2e.html,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/06/darwin-shooting-police-called-about-behaviour-of-alleged-killer-before-shootings,https://nypost.com/2019/03/09/at-least-15-people-gunned-down-in-mexican-nightclub-shooting/,https://www.news.com.au/world/gunmen-kill-13-in-mexico-bar-shooting-as-owner-targeted/news-story/d1e9673042aa1443f602c0c0192ac528,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-dj-known-as-perplex-shot-dead-in-club-in-central-mexico-1.7422680,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/17/cancun-shooting-five-people-gunned-down-in-mexicos-tourist-hotspot,https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1157772771193049088,https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1157778933573492736,https://www.facebook.com/JawnMurrayWorld/photos/a.10152606490613347/10156998985638347/?type=3&theater,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/christchurch-attack-death-toll-climbs-to-51/11075972,https://www.rand.org/about/vision.html,https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/mass-shootings.html,https://www.motherjones.com/about/,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/",Figures for 2019 mass shootings list inconsistent,,,,,,

The group states that its posts “are to help community action groups get their message across. Posts may be edited and shared without accreditation”.The AnalysisAuthor, journalist and humourist Mark Twain was born Samuel Clemens on November 30, 1835 and is regarded as one of America’s most famous writers. Twain’s best known novels are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)  and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) based on the adventures of young boys on the Mississippi River. His travelogue, The Innocents Abroad (1869) was a best-seller and the semi-autobiographical, Roughing it (1872), was also successful. Since his death in 1910, Twain’s writings have been translated into at least 72 languages.The post attributing the quote to Twain does not include a date for when he purportedly made the statement. The Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, Connecticut was the author’s home from 1874 to 1891 and among its educational aims today is to assist in the teaching of Twain’s “life and works”.Mark Twain, who lived from 1835 to 1910, wrote several famous novels including ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’.A museum spokeswoman told AAP FactCheck that its curatorial staff found “no trace” online which supported attribution of the quote to Twain “other than in the usual inspirational or business works”.The quote was also not found on www.twainquotes.com – a website that describes itself as a “directory of Mark Twain’s maxims, quotations and various opinions”. The site features an A-Z search of subjects on which Twain was quoted. The website is published by Barbara Schmidt.  Ms Schmidt, a US-based researcher, writer and “consultant on Mark Twain related projects” including the Center for Mark Twain Studies in New York, told AAP FactCheck the quote is “not found in any of Mark Twain’s known works, letters, or speeches”.","http://www.facebook.com/communityactionmemes/photos/a.578485555902731/737930326624919/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/communityactionmemes/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Twain,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/mark-twain-american-sarah-churchwell,https://marktwainhouse.org/about/the-house/history/,https://marktwainhouse.org/teachers-students/educational-resources/,http://www.twainquotes.com,http://www.twainquotes.com/twain3d.html,https://marktwainstudies.com/author/schmidtbrb/",Mark Twain “evidence” quote is false,,,,,,

The explanation of how to distinguish between the genders is superimposed on an image showing two capsicums – one with three lobes and one with four.David Wolfe describes himself in his Facebook profile as “one of the world’s leading orators” and says “his passion is health and wellbeing”. Mr Wolfe has also filmed infomercials advertising the NutriBullet blender, authored a number of books including ‘Eating for Beauty’, ‘Naked Chocolate’ and ‘Superfoods: The Food and Medicine of the Future’. He has also spoken publicly against the use of vaccines.The post has been shared over 59,000 times, and has attracted 38,000 reactions and 3,600 comments.Mr Wolfe’s Facebook page has over 12.5 million likes.The image has been shared in Australia as recently as August 5.The AnalysisQueensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry horticulturist Dr Elio Jovichich told AAP FactCheck, “ Fruits do not have a gender… Any quick search into botany and biology aspects of capsicums will confirm that fruits formed after pollination do not have specific sex.”Dr Jovichich also said the number of lobes on a capsicum has “no relationship to taste”. Experts say the number of lobes on a capsicums has no relationship to taste or the number of seeds.Associate Professor Daniel Tan, from the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences, told AAP FactCheck the post is “fake news”.“Each individual capsicum is produced mainly through the self-fertilisation of a flower that is bisexual – both male and female,” Dr Tan said.“The number of chambers in a capsicum is determined by genetics and has no impact on the number of seeds produced or sweetness of flesh.”Similar images repeating the capsicum gender claim have been circulating on the internet since at least 2013, and have been debunked multiple times.Fact-checkers Snopes rebutted the claim in 2015, and a number of gardening or cooking sites, including Culinary Lore and Gardening Know How, have dispelled the myth as well.Botanist, science writer and BBC broadcaster James Wong also wrote a column in The Guardian contradicting the claim that capsicums have genders, saying: “While there are such things as male and female plants, and even male and female parts of the same flower, there is no such thing as gender (or sex) in fruit. That would imply that fruit sexually reproduce with each other. They don’t.“They are just a fleshy package that contains the end product of sexual reproduction, the seeds.”Pat Patterson a horticulture program assistant from Oregon University, also weighed in: “By definition, all pepper fruits are ripened ovaries containing seeds formed after pollination. Those seeds will then form new pepper plants. The bumps or lack thereof are primarily related to the variety and growing conditions. Sweetness is usually a factor of ripeness.”These experts are supported by the Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts, which notes that capsicums come from “perfect” flowers – meaning they have both female and male sex organs: “The flowers are protogynous, but readily self-pollinate.” The Encyclopaedia also says capsicums have usually between two and four lobes, but can have more.","https://www.facebook.com/DavidAvocadoWolfe/photos/a.10150364951666512/10155521849551512/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/DavidAvocadoWolfe/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77YRFetsZkU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhNXatwNMG0,https://b105country.com/are-there-male-and-female-peppers-and-does-it-really-make-a-difference-in-taste/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gender-pepper/,https://culinarylore.com/food-science:once-and-for-all-bell-peppers-do-not-have-gender/,https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/pepper/bell-pepper-lobes.htm,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/beware-fake-news-even-in-the-garden-james-wong,https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/vegetables/are-there-male-female-peppers,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cjHCoMQNkcgC&pg=PA862&lpg=PA862&dq=Pepper+flowers+are+complete+and+perfect,+that+is+they+have+a+calyx,+corolla+and+male+and+female+sex+organs.+The+flowers+are+protogynous,+but+readily+self-pollinate.&source=bl&ots=u-Yn8s4GV-&sig=P1a4d7A0tfJjqeKv54CRowD0Vww&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uiXZVNyAMsOSyASMpIGoBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Pepper%20flowers%20are%20complete%20and%20perfect%2C%20that%20is%20they%20have%20a%20calyx%2C%20corolla%20and%20male%20and%20female%20sex%20organs.%20The%20flowers%20are%20protogynous%2C%20but%20readily%20self-pollinate.&f=false",Capsicums do not have genders,,,,,,

The post compared the amount of government compensation paid to asylum seekers detained on Manus Island with the amount of assistance paid to drought-affected farmers.A Facebook post from August 5, 2018 claims refugees on Manus Island receive more in compensation from the Australian government than drought-affected farmers.The top image shows a man wearing white earphones gesturing towards a beach behind him. Text overlaid on the image reads: “$35,000+ The amount of compensation each ‘refugee’ on Manus Island received for trying to enter our country illegally”. The bottom image shows a farmer kneeling in a dry dirt field. Text on that image reads: “$12,000 The amount of compensation each farmer who has suffered through years of drought will receive”.  At the bottom of the post, a headline reads: “What a Joke!”.The Take Back Australia Facebook page has over 23,000 likes and states: “It’s been long enough sitting on the sidelines and ignoring what’s happening to our great Country. It’s time to fight just like our diggers fought for our (sic)”. The post had been shared more than 6,800 times and attracted more than 150 comments and 620 reactions.The AnalysisA class action on behalf of Manus Island detainees was brought against the Australian government and two subcontracted service providers in the Victorian Supreme Court in 2017. The class action claimed detainees were illegally detained and kept in conditions that did not meet Australian standards. The claim related to detainees kept on Manus Island between 2012 and 2016. The government settled the case in 2018, paying out $70 million in compensation.A farmer on a drought-affected property in central NSW, Australia.Of 1,923 eligible detainees, 1693 people registered to claim their portion of the payout.AAP FactCheck calculated that if the full amount was shared among all eligible detainees each could have received approximately $36,400. However individual payments ranged from a few thousand dollars to almost $100,000.For Australian farmers affected by drought, federal government income support is available to farmers suffering financial hardship, including from drought, through the Farm Household Allowance. The Commonwealth government introduced the Farm Household Allowance in 2014, replacing a number of financial supports previously available. Farm Household Allowance was originally available for up to three years and in 2018 the Agricultural and Water Resources Minister, David Littleproud, announced the government would extend the time limit to receive the allowance to four years.Under the Farm Household Allowance Scheme, farmers are eligible for a fortnightly payment, equal to the relevant Newstart or Youth Allowance rate, for up to four years. Eligibility is subject to an assets and circumstances test. Farmers are also eligible for an Activity Supplement up to $4,000 to pay for study, training or professional advice about their financial situation and they have access to a Farm Household Case Officer.A federal Department of Agriculture spokesperson told AAP FactCheck a supplementary lump sum payment of up to $7,200 for single farmers and $12,000 for farming couples was available from September 1, 2018 to June 1, 2019. The payment was distributed in two lump sums.Through Farm Household Allowance and the supplement, a single farmer with no children, for example, could receive up to $68,992.80 spread over four years. This is composed of a $555.70 fortnightly payment, a one-off $4,000 activity supplement and a $7,200 supplement lump sum. After June 1, a single farmer would not receive the $7,200 lump sum – meaning the total available over four years could be up to $61,792.80. For a farmer with dependent children, the fortnightly payment is $601.10. Combined with a one-off activity supplement of $4,000 and a $7,200 supplement if before June 1, the total received over four years could be up to $73,714.40. After June 1, the $7,200 lump sum would not be available, taking the total over four years to a maximum of $66,514.40.For a farming couple, from September 1, 2018 to June 1, 2019, they could together receive up to $124,353.60 over four years. The couple could receive up to $501.70 each or a total $1003.40 every fortnight, a $4000 activity supplement each and a combined $12,000 supplement lump sum. After June 1, 2019, a farming couple could receive up to  $112,353.60 over four years.The detainees compensated by the Australian government received a one-off compensation settlement ordered by a court and equal to an average of $36,400, with individual amounts varying greatly. The amount of drought hardship assistance available to Australian farmers is greater, subject to assessment of the individual farmer’s situation. Farming couples were eligible for a one-off $12,000 payment, as the Facebook post states, before June 1, 2019, however that was a supplement to other support that remains available.","https://www.facebook.com/763065747072290/photos/a.798054873573377/1835233169855537/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Take-Back-Australia-763065747072290/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-06/manus-island-detainees-settlement-with-commonwealth/8876934,https://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/assets/2017/09/fd/038b1cd0d/noticeofproposedsettlement24072017.pdf,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/former-manus-island-detainees-paid-70-million-in-compensation,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/former-manus-island-detainees-paid-70-million-in-compensation,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/farm-household-allowance,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2018/June/Farm_Household_Allowance,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/farm-household-allowance/how-much-you-can-get,https://www.business.gov.au/assistance/farm-household-allowance-program,https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/news/extra-payment-farmers",Claim that drought-affected farmers get less in government assistance than Manus Island detainees is false,,,,,,

August 7, 2019. The AnalysisFederal coalition MP Keith Pitt has campaigned for nuclear power to be investigated as an option to form part of Australia’s energy mix. Mr Pitt believes nuclear should not be excluded and Australia should re-examine its moratorium on the construction of nuclear power plants.AAP FactCheck examined the Queensland MP’s claim that Australia is the only OECD country that does not use nuclear power. Mr Pitt’s statement was made as the federal government announced on August 7 an inquiry into the feasibility of using nuclear energy as a power source for Australia. The new inquiry follows a 2016 nuclear fuel cycle royal commission by the South Australian government and a 2006 federal review by the Howard government. The 2006 review found Australia would need about 25 reactors to supply one-third of the nation’s electricity supply by 2050, while the 2016 commission’s found SA “could safely manage” used nuclear fuel from other countries. Submissions to the new federal government review are open until September 16 with a view to finalising a report by the end of the year. Nuclear power stations use uranium as the fuel source for generating electricity, with heat from the nuclear reaction used to drive steam turbines connected to electricity generators.In 1998 the Howard government banned domestic nuclear energy, despite Australia having some of the largest uranium deposits in the world. Australia’s ban on nuclear power and nuclear power plant construction is enforced by two acts of federal parliament – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998. Section 140A of the EPBC Act 1999 states: “The minister must not approve an action consisting of or involving the construction or operation of any of the following nuclear installations: a) a nuclear fuel fabrication plant; b) a nuclear power plant; c) an enrichment plant; d) a reprocessing facility”. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act applies to Commonwealth bodies and is not a barrier for state government body or private developer. Australia is the world’s third-largest uranium producer after Kazakhstan and Canada with uranium ore exports valued at $575 million in 2017-18, according to data from the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office. Uranium mining provided the equivalent of 98 per cent of the global nuclear power industry’s uranium requirements in 2016. Regarding Mr Pitt’s claim, the OECD was established in 1961 as a forum for governments to “seek solutions to common economic and social problems”. OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the OECD and Nuclear Energy Agency’s 2018 report, a table for nuclear electricity generation lists totals for OECD nations separating them into nuclear and non-nuclear countries. Listed under non-nuclear countries for OECD Pacific are Australia and New Zealand, while in Europe there are 14 nations listed and for the Americas, Chile is a non-nuclear country. Industry Super Australia chief economist Stephen Anthony, was quoted as saying on June 26, 2019: “The point about nuclear is that all other OECD countries have nuclear, we do not.” Mr Anthony’s interview with the ABC’s World Today program included an editor’s note which stated: “The interviewee in the report states that all OECD countries use nuclear power – except for Australia. According to OECD figures, 16 of its members do not use nuclear power”. When contacted about the source of his claim, Mr Pitt’s office told AAP FactCheck that the Hinkley MP “misspoke” during the interview with Sky News.Based on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr Pitt’s statement to be false. Australia is not the only OECD nation that does not use nuclear power.","https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6068721642001,https://www.perthnow.com.au/politics/one-month-for-nuclear-inquiry-submissions-ng-s-1960038,https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/international-relations/asno-annual-report-2015-16/html/section-2/nuclear-fuel-cycle-royal-commission-of-south-australia.html,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00977,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00440,https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/corporate/annual-reports/asno-annual-report-2017-18/html/section-2/australias-uranium-production-and-exports.html,https://www.oecdwatch.org/oecd-ncps/about-the-oecd/,https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2018/7416-ned-2018.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/worldtoday/australia-should-consider-nuclear-energy/11247620",Is Australia the only OECD country that does not use nuclear power?,,,,,,

The world will have a generation of idiots”.A Facebook post from July 10, 2019 attributes Albert Einstein with the quote: “I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots”.Above the quote, six images appear under the headline: “The day that Albert Einstein feared has arrived”. The images show people focused on their mobile phones during activities described as “coffee with friends, a day in beach (sic), cheering your team, out on a date, enjoying the sites, having dinner”. The Burleigh Heads Catholic Parish is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane and is based on Queensland’s Gold Coast.The post had been shared over 320 times and attracted more than 65 reactions.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck searched for the quote in “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein” by Alice Calaprice and found no evidence that Einstein said it.  The “Ultimate Quotable Einstein” is a collection of Einstein’s quotations, compiled by Alice Calaprice, a renowned Einstein expert and a former senior editor at the Princeton University Press. The book contains roughly 1600 quotes attributed to the theoretical physicist.The collection recorded the Nobel Prize winner saying the word “technology” five times about the rise of technology, including in a letter to German inventor, Rudolf Goldschmidt in 1928 when he wrote: “A little technology here and there can interest thinkers everywhere. And so I boldly think ahead: The two of us will lay an egg” A search for Albert Einstein’s quote in the book, The Utlimate Quotable Einstein, found no evidence the Nobel Prize winner said it.In another letter to psychiatrist Otto Juliusburger in 1946, the physicist conveyed his concerns about technology, writing: “I believe that the abominable deterioration of ethical standards stems primarily from the mechanization and depersonalization of our lives—a disastrous byproduct of science and technology. Nostra culpa!” Emily de Araújo, assistant editor of the Einstein Papers Project, advised AAP FactCheck Einstein “did not write or say: ‘I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots’”.The Einstein Papers Project consists of a group of international scholars who collect, transcribe, annotate, and publish ‘The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein’, a publication which presents the “first complete picture of a massive written legacy that ranges from Einstein’s first work on the special and general theories of relativity and the origins of quantum theory, to his active involvement with international collaboration and cooperation, human rights, education, and disarmament”.AAP FactCheck found a similar quote to the one attributed to Einstein in the 1995 film, “Powder”. In a scene, Donald Ripley, played by Jeff Goldblum said, “It has become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity” to which Powder, played by Sean Patrick Flanery, replied “Albert Einstein”.","https://www.facebook.com/1663181593912918/photos/a.1679152188982525/2411881519042918/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Burleigh-Heads-Catholic-Parish-1663181593912918/about/?ref=page_internal,https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9268.html,https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2018/02/08/albert_einsteins_forgotten_inventions.html,http://archives.nypl.org/mss/1609,http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/who/index.html,http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/what/index.html,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114168/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114168/quotes/qt0146361",Einstein quote that technology will create idiots is false,,,,,,
365,,,,True,,2019-08-09,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/is-only-12-per-cent-of-plastic-waste-recycled-in-australia/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“Twelve per cent of our plastics are recycled in this country. I think we’re breaking the faith with Australia.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison. August 2, 2019. The AnalysisPrime Minister Scott Morrison was seeking agreement from state governments on plastic recycling at the first post-election Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting on Friday, August 9. Mr Morrison labelled Australia’s record on recycling “appalling” and said the current situation was “breaking the faith” with Australians who were doing the right thing. AAP FactCheck examined Mr Morrison’s claim that only 12 per cent of Australia’s waste plastic was recycled.The national recycling industry has been under pressure since 2018, when China, the biggest importer of recyclable waste from Australia, placed stringent restrictions on waste imports, effectively closing the door to a large proportion of Australian recycling exports. In August 2019, one of the largest Australian recycling companies SKM collapsed, leaving tens of thousands of tonnes of Victorian kerbside recycling stockpiled and destined largely for landfill. According to the 2018 National Waste Report, prepared for the federal government and released in November 2018, Australia recycled 12 per cent of the 2.5 million tonnes of waste plastic generated in 2016/17 from packaging, construction and industrial sources. The majority of waste plastic – 87 per cent – goes to landfill and just one per cent is used in waste-to-energy facilities.Another report, the 2017-18 Australian Plastics Recycling Survey commissioned by the Australian, Victorian, New South Wales and West Australian governments and published in January 2019, arrived at a lower 9.4 per cent recycling rate but stated the figure may be conservative as it was based on waste from short-term use such as packaging. Having correctly identified the plastics recycling rate as 12 per cent, the PM went on to say: “We are not recycling plastics in this country, it’s going into landfill or it’s going into boats and being sent up to Asia.”  This is not correct, although the rate of local recycling is low.Of the 320,000 tonnes of waste plastic recycled in 2017/18, 54.5 per cent was exported while the remaining 45.5 per cent was reprocessed in Australia, the Australian Plastics Recycling Survey found. That local reprocessing equates to about four per cent of the plastic Australians consume.Plastics recycling in Australia includes work undertaken by packaging giant Visy, which reprocesses 95,000 tonnes of plastic each year, largely turning it into food and drink packaging. Coles water bottles, Praise sauce bottles and Schweppes soft drinks all use recycled or semi-recycled packaging from Visy. Another Australian company, Replas, turns plastic waste collected in Australia into outdoor products such as bollards, decking furniture and signage.[10]Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Morrison’s claim to be true. The statement that 12 per cent of Australia’s waste plastic being recycled is supported by data from the 2018 National Waste Report.","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/08/scott-morrison-to-push-premiers-to-improve-appalling-record-on-plastic-recycling,https://7news.com.au/politics/federal-politics/scott-morrison-rules-out-increasing-newstart-payments-c-379300?fbclid=IwAR0cEDm2naBm1rAUFbqVU6-mjhiFuHeH_tRqS54l5qMoMrAh25SWteVA0Ro,https://theconversation.com/chinas-recycling-ban-throws-australia-into-a-very-messy-waste-crisis-95522,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/07/recycling-crisis-land-owners-face-millions-in-clean-up-costs-after-skm-collapse,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/7381c1de-31d0-429b-912c-91a6dbc83af7/files/national-waste-report-2018.pdf,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/3f275bb3-218f-4a3d-ae1d-424ff4cc52cd/files/australian-plastics-recycling-survey-report-2017-18.pdf,https://7news.com.au/politics/federal-politics/scott-morrison-rules-out-increasing-newstart-payments-c-379300?fbclid=IwAR0cEDm2naBm1rAUFbqVU6-mjhiFuHeH_tRqS54l5qMoMrAh25SWteVA0Ro,https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/3f275bb3-218f-4a3d-ae1d-424ff4cc52cd/files/australian-plastics-recycling-survey-report-2017-18.pdf,https://www.visy.com.au/recycling/about,https://www.visy.com.au/there-is-a-better-way,https://www.replas.com.au/recycling/",Is only 12 per cent of plastic waste recycled in Australia?,,,,,,

The post has been shared more than 620 times and attracted more than 50 comments and 280 reactions. Fair Dinkum Mate 2 has more than 4900 followers. A previous page, Fair Dinkum Mate was closed by Facebook, according to a post by the group on March 20, 2018. Fair Dinkum Mate 2 predicts the social media platform will close its current page because “it seems we are not allowed to express conservative, political views that go against the narrative of the United Nations New World Order’, before adding “if you are in favour of free speech then I hope you enjoy this page”. The AnalysisThe image posted by Fair Dinkum Mate 2 does not include a source for its figures on the number of Jewish, Christian and Islamic terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. AAP FactCheck found a number of terrorist attacks had been committed by Jews and Christians since 9/11.In July 2015, a Palestinian baby was burned alive after Israeli extremists burned a West Bank family home.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the incident as an “act of terrorism”.Regarding Jewish terror attacks, an Israeli soldier Eden Natan-Zada shot at a bus in northern Israel in August 2005, killing four Israeli-Arabs and injuring 12 others. Then Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon described the shooting as “a reprehensible act by a bloodthirsty Jewish terrorist who sought to attack innocent Israeli citizens”. He added: “This terrorist event was a deliberate attempt to harm the fabric of relations among all Israeli citizens.” In July 2015, a Palestinian baby was burned alive and his parents and brother were seriously injured after Israeli extremists burned a West Bank family home, according to a report by news agency Agence France Presse (AFP). Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the incident as an “act of terrorism” which the report said was a term “rarely used by Israel in anti-Palestinian attacks”. Israel’s then defence minister Moshe Yaalon called the attackers “Jewish terrorists”. In January 2019, Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom published a report detailing a rise in violence by “right-wing Jewish activists” during 2018. The newspaper said the incidents in which “extremists targeted security forces tripled from 2017 to 2018, from 14 to 42”.Regarding Christian terrorist attacks, there are also a number of examples. In July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a car bombing and shooting spree in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. A police official described Breivik as “a right-wing fundamentalist Christian”. A manifesto, signed by Breivik, titled ‘2083: A European Declaration of Independence’ said multiculturalism was “destroying European Christian civilisation”. Brevik was charged with committing acts of terror and voluntary homicide. He is serving a 21-year jail sentence with the possibility of an extension. In November 2015, Robert Dear, a self-described Christian, killed three people and wounded nine others at a parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, USA. Mr Dear said in a 2016 interview from jail that started having mental problems following the 1993 siege at the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco Texas, which left some 80 people dead. “It started 22 years ago in Waco… I’m a Christian and so when they burned up those Christians and 17 little kids and everything else I was pretty upset about it”. Dear is facing 179 charges, including murder and attempted murder but was ruled “mentally incompetent” to stand trial in August, 2019. In Uganda, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) emerged in 1987 after leader Joseph Kony called for the African country to be governed according to his interpretation of the Bible’s Ten Commandments. The LRA abducted and killed thousands in northern Uganda, according to the US-based non-governmental body Human Rights Watch (HRW). Military campaigns against the LRA pushed the group into southern Sudan (now South Sudan) in 2005, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  in 2006 and the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2008. In 2013, the United Nations estimated the LRA had killed more than 100,000 people and between 60,000 to 100,000 children had been abducted since its formation. A 2018 BBC report detailed how LRA leader Joseph Kony instructed rebels to follow religious rituals such as making a sign of the cross before heading off to fight. “You must also take oil and draw a cross on your chest, your forehead, and each shoulder, and you must make a cross in oil on your gun. They say that the oil is the power of the Holy Spirit,” a former LRA fighter told Human Rights Watch. Kony remains on the run and is wanted on 12 counts of crimes against humanity and 21 counts of war crimes.","https://www.facebook.com/fairdinkumate2/photos/a.2307864899497602/2390188924598532/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/fairdinkumate2/posts/?ref=page_internal,https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-aug-05-fg-mideast5-story.html,https://www.rtbf.be/info/monde/detail_un-bebe-palestinien-brule-vif-dans-une-attaque-d-extremistes-israeliens?id=9044759,https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/01/11/incidents-of-jewish-terrorism-attacks-on-security-forces-spike-in-2018/,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-norway-mass-murderer-appeal-european-human-rights-court-oslo-strasbourg-a8409861.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/world/europe/24oslo.html?mtrref=www.google.com&assetType=REGIWALL,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/planned-parenthood-gunman-robert-dear-im-on-righteous-crusade/,https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/08/05/robert-dear-planned-parenthood-shooting/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/21/qa-joseph-kony-and-lords-resistance-army#3,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/dominic-ongwen-the-hague-lords-resistance-army-war-crimes-uganda,https://www.denverpost.com/2013/05/20/konys-lra-has-killed-more-than-100000-un/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17299084",Claim there have been zero Jewish and Christian terrorist attacks since 9/11 is false,,,,,,

The post stated “Nightmare Alert – This 32cm huntsman was captured in the small town of Hotham just east of Darwin yesterday afternoon! As seen on channel 7 news this morning.” This Facebook post from August 7, 2019 by Ripped Animals claimed a 32cm huntsman spider had been captured in the town of Hotham, east of Darwin.The Ripped Animals Facebook page has over 42,300 likes and states it “features some of the most aesthetic creatures the world has to offer”.The spider post had been shared over 200 times and received more than 1400 comments and 300 reactions. Many comments questioned the authenticity of the post.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found there is no town named Hotham near Darwin or anywhere in the Northern Territory. The only Hotham in Australia is in Victoria and is “one of Australia’s highest alpine villages”. There is a Cape Hotham Lighthouse on the shores of the Timor Sea on a long unnamed peninsula about 80km northeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory. The Hotham lighthouse marks the entrance to Clarence Strait, the eastern approach to Darwin.A real huntsman: this World Wildlife Fund images shows one of the world’s largest huntsman spiders – with a leg span of 30 cm – found in Khammouan province, Laos.AAP FactCheck found no Channel 7 news report about this image of a giant huntsman spider, found near Darwin or anywhere else. According to the Australian Museum, huntsman are large, long-legged spiders which live under loose bark on trees, in crevices on rock walls and in logs and are notorious for entering houses and cars. The Queensland Museum states the huntsman is perhaps Australia’s largest and most feared spider because of its large size and ability to quickly run across walls and ceilings. “The first two pairs of legs are usually the longest pairs and the legs tend to go sideways from the body,” Queensland Museum’s website states. The Facebook spider image did not match this description of a huntsman with the first two pairs of legs being the longest.AAP FactCheck traced the image of the spider alongside the man’s hand back to a Facebook post from November 11, 2015 by the Goliath Bird-eating Tarantula Club. The post was shared over 60 times and a number of the 40 comments questioned whether the image had been photoshopped to enhance the size of the spider. The same image is used as one of the page’s profile photos.According to the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Washington DC, the Goliath birdeater tarantula is the biggest tarantula in the world. The body measures up to 12cm with a leg span of up to 28cm.  This description better matched the image in the Facebook post.The institute also stated the Goliath birdeater lives in the rainforest regions of northern South America, including Venezuela, northern Brazil, Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname.AAP FactCheck found the same image had been used by a number of websites and social media posts to illustrate the goliath birdeater spider.  On April 6, 2018 the same image was used by Alchetron.com, a free social encyclopedia website, to illustrate a story about goliath birdeater spider which it said could grow to a weight of 175 grams. The image was reproduced by Our Breathing Planet website which stated the Goliath Birdeater was a species of tarantula that ranks as the largest of all known spiders and the largest known type of arachnid.The same image was correctly identified and posted at least twice on Facebook before it appeared as a “32cm huntsman” on Ripped Animals’ Facebook page.

On August 4, a 24-year-old gunman killed at least nine people in Dayton, Ohio.One Nation leader and senator Pauline Hanson told Nine Network’s Today show everyone should speak out against extremists in the aftermath of the US shootings. She compared the United States’ gun laws to Australia, stating the US laws were “very loose” and urged investigations into why “angry young men” were committing these crimes.AAP FactCheck examined Senator Hanson’s claim that mass shootings happen more often in France, Switzerland and Finland than in the United States.Senator Hanson’s claim that France, Switzerland and Finland have more mass shootings than the US appears to be based on research from the Crime Prevention Research Centre (CPRC). The CPRC states, “our goal is to provide an objective and accurate scientific evaluation of both the costs and benefits of gun ownership as well as policing activities”. A 2015 CPRC report stated the US had a lower frequency of mass public shootings than European countries based on a per capita basis in that country, or the number of mass shootings per one million people in each country. According to CPRC report, the frequency of mass public shootings per million people in the US was 0.078 which placed it 12th in the world on this measure. France had a mass shooting frequency rate of 0.092, placing it 11th. Finland was seventh with a frequency rate of 0.184. Switzerland was fourth with a rate of 0.249. The top ranking nations by this measure were Macedonia, followed by Albania and Serbia.Based on 2018 population data from the World Bank, the US has 327 million people and almost five times more than France with a population of 67 million. Finland had 5.5 million people and Switzerland has a population of 8.5 million.In her claim Senator Hanson did not refer to the frequency of mass shootings per capita in each country. She used the term “happens more often” which refers to the number or incidences of mass shootings.According to the RAND Gun Policy in America Initiative, there is no official definition as to what constitutes a mass shooting. Media organisations reporting on mass shootings generally accept the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) definition of mass murderer as someone who “kills four or more people in a single incident (not including himself), typically in a single location”. The RAND Corporation states it is a public policy research organisation.According to data from US investigative magazine Mother Jones, which has been updated since the Ohio and Texas shootings, there had been a total of 951 fatalities from 114 mass shootings in the United States since 1982. In 2019 so far, there have been seven mass shootings resulting in at least 59 deaths. Mother Jones classifies a mass shooting as a perpetrator taking at least four lives. In 2013, the US government revised this down to three fatalities and this figure was adopted by Mother Jones research. Other criteria include killings carried out by a lone shooter and in a public place, crimes primarily related to gang activity or armed robbery were not included, nor were mass killings that took place in private homes. Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim tallies. It also included a handful of cases, also known as “spree killings” where the event took place over multiple locations but still fits the criteria.AAP FactCheck used this same criteria to analyse mass shooting events in the three European countries Senator Hanson cited ie France, Switzerland and Finland. AAP FactCheck found that all three countries had a vastly lower number of mass shootings compared to the US. From 2012-2019 France had seven mass shootings, Switzerland had one in 2001 and Finland suffered four between 2000 and 2019. The US by comparison had 59 mass shootings from 2012-2019 and since 2000, there have been 83 mass shootings in America.Here’s the breakdown of AAP FactCheck’s analysis comparing the number of mass shootings in the US, with France, Switzerland and Finland.FranceFrance experienced two mass shootings in 2012 with 11 people killed. In one event seven people were killed in the cities of Toulouse and Montauban. In the second, four people were killed near Lake Annecy in the French Alps. The US experienced seven mass shootings in 2012 in which 71 people were killed. [10]In 2015, France experienced three mass shootings killing 147 people. The Charlie Hebdo shootings killed 13, a second attack at a Paris supermarket killed four and a third event 130 people were killed in Paris across five locations. In 2015, the US experienced seven mass shootings with 46 fatalities recorded.In 2018, France experienced two mass shootings and a total of 10 deaths. In the cities of Trebes and Cacassonne five people died. In December another five people died in a shooting at a Christmas market in Strasbourg. In the US in 2018, there were 12 mass shootings with 80 people killed.  SwitzerlandThere have been no mass shootings in Switzerland since 2001 when 14 people died after a man stormed the local parliament in the city of Zug, before killing himself. The US had one mass shooting in 2001 when a disgruntled employee attacked his former workplace in Illinois, resulting in five fatalities. Since that 2001 attack, the US has experienced another 82 mass shootings through to 2019, resulting in 689 deaths.FinlandThere have been four mass shootings in Finland from 2000 to 2019. There were two school shootings in 2007 and 2008 – which resulted in 18 fatalities according to a 2016 publication, Mass Shootings: Media, Myths, and Realities by Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. In December 2009 in Finland, five people were killed in a shopping centre shooting in the city of Espoo. In December 2016, three people died in a shooting in the town of Imatra. Since 2000, there have been 83 mass shootings in the US resulting in 696 fatalities.Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Senator Hanson’s claim is false. Only when mass shooting data is measured on a per capita basis for each country can the One Nation leader claim other European countries outrank the US. However she stated in her claim that mass shootings “happens more often” which refers to the number or incidence of mass shootings.","https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/el-paso-dayton-shootings-august-2019/index.html,https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1158120522913157120,https://crimeresearch.org/about-us/,https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/,https://data.worldbank.org/country,https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/mass-shootings.html,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33288542,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-44684054,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33288542,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/,https://www.france24.com/en/20181020-three-people-indicted-france-connection-march-terrorist-attack-islamic-state,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46535862,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/switzerland-gun-laws-rates-of-gun-deaths-2018-2?r=US&IR=T,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/,https://www.gq.com/story/americas-mass-shooting-republican-rule,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/31/helsinki-shopping-centre-shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/three-women-shot-dead-outside-restaurant-finland,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/","Do mass shootings occur more often in France, Switzerland and Finland than in the United States?",,,,,,
370,,,,False,,2019-08-07,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/henry-kissingers-claim-about-using-vaccinations-for-social-and-population-control-is-false/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from August 2, 2019 that featured an image of former US Secretary of State and 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Henry Kissinger together with long quote about vaccination attributed to him from “a speech to the World Health Organisation Council on Eugenics Feb 25, 2009.” The quote infers that mandatory vaccination is a highly-profitable tool for social and population control.  This Facebook post containing a quote about using vaccinations to control the population was falsely attributed to former US Secretary of State and 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Henry Kissinger. The quote states: “Once the herd accepts mandatory forcible vaccination, it’s game over! They will accept anything – forcible blood or organ donation – for the ‘greater good’. We can genetically modify children and sterilize them – for the ‘greater good’. Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It’s a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services. Now what’s for lunch, huh?”  The post was accompanied by the following statement: “I went to share this and got a warning if I did so I screen shot it and post and see what happens. Freedom of speech lol, it’s like we live in North Korea.”The post had been shared over 80 times and attracted over 25 reactions. The same post was also shared on Facebook in America on May 6, 2019 with over 70 shares here and again on July 21, 2019 here as well as in March in Canada here. The AnalysisHenry Kissinger came to America aged 15 with his German-Jewish family in 1938 after Adolf Hitler came to power. He studied at Harvard and worked at Harvard University from 1954-1971 in the Department of Government and the Center for International Affairs. He won the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the ceasefires contained in the Paris Peace Accords on “Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam”. He served as US Secretary of State from 1973-77 and wrote many books and articles on US foreign policy, international affairs and diplomatic history. He’s chairman of his own international consulting firm, Kissinger Associates.AAP FactCheck found no reference to a February 25, 2009 statement made by Dr Kissinger in his speech and interview website archives.   President Nixon (left) appointed Henry Kissinger (right) as his Secretary of State while also keeping him in the role of National Security adviser.The closest speech to the stated date was delivered by Dr Kissinger to the 45th Munich Security Conference on February 6, 2009, when he spoke about nuclear weapons. There was no mention of the quote posted on Facebook or about vaccinations, the herd or forcible blood and organ donation.There was another Kissinger speech on April 26, 2009 made at the Trilateral Commission Tokyo Plenary Meeting titled ‘The Intellectual Underpinnings of the Trilateral Partnership in the 21st Century’. Again there was no mention of the quote posted on Facebook, vaccinations, the herd or forcible blood and organ donation.The only document authored by or quoting Dr Kissinger AAP FactCheck could source about population control was a 123-page National Security Study Memorandum dated December 10, 1974 and declassified by the White House in 1989. Titled ‘Implications of Worldwide Population Growth. For U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (THE KISSINGER REPORT)’, it contains no mention of the quote on Facebook or any reference to vaccinations, the herd etc. AAP FactCheck found the forum where Dr Kissinger was alleged to have made the statement – the World Health Organization Council on Eugenics – did not exist.A World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told PolitiFact fact-checking website in June, 2019 there was no record in the WHO archives of the speech or any “World Health Organization Council on Eugenics” forum.“We have no records of any such speech,” Mr Lindmeier advised PolitiFact in an email. “Please also note that there is no such ‘Council’ as claimed in the statement, respectively a related meme.”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214667126327182&set=a.2137139383412&type=3&theater,https://www.henryakissinger.com/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156505870851448&set=a.10150209527476448&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213583684172974&set=a.10204417087853795&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213804459325238&set=bc.AbrhDdEGU8RMbV7ZOBN7S2vkaTp7NVb9zleBffmeHnkP0uDn_iR_l-LCXp5eMEEsYyn0j_26GvhYMfEaQUHq7vu-Ey6qlzeNkIGQkMxbqXQ30c6jMPf1d8SrA0eJNva-OVdf_xQwLngwdSAugrJ-uBzx&type=1&opaqueCursor=AbravOUuJmDZjBQzJo78vogB_ZJsUL1MjVB3BIDUMEEW75jBQS6rKQbTBA9i4BkYdSAkPDyA2kKa_uI4za94tviiCllYCALCB5kpQU76z8md6PCFkfx8skz7J9Zxmkc9YJpBFpKqmXmhSON3NOUWBp-4MJXpmLcWrJqjccq41iahZ6HHyBZrTJ7LhkcEZWYyAEMqRf0xKYRgyOG92sVlkvBK-amnJv9v1qL1_Mz7LfBF0OAthf7ig6clcjGIRZFx90k_mwLkdV75BQVqtZQ29j64PQC27M32jglQ2Sl6OmoEfXgr_eh2-d4BAARV_QVyslkonEOcm9Q64cwwKcMLxgTDQyujAqJMmUNna7qw8dt6t1PUhyDrxx_4KhujzIas_V3F-1NSu8wdEF0Wq724K0g5ajiS6-kI7RI9A0GqNJ0cVNLEwOCmCPzgNGVBqE4XXptZwhbVwMkieuSFHzBnHvl0FS5nr6yxuQ_UyTGVgyTnNT3UqaEi7gDqsY8wC2tSdaZc-u8ryJN3frZ4JlDtXgNaOpGtFq-JYLS1PdGu1eAN6Q&theater,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1973/kissinger/biogaphical/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1973/kissinger/facts/,https://www.henryakissinger.com/speeches/page/2/,https://www.henryakissinger.com/speeches/page/2/,https://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/henrykissinger45thmunichsecurityconference.htm,https://www.henryakissinger.com/speeches/the-intellectual-underpinnings-of-the-trilateral-partnership-in-the-21st-century/,https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pcaab500.pdf,https://www.who.int/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/blog/2011/oct/06/who-pays-for-politifact/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jun/25/facebook-posts/henry-kissinger-never-said-once-herd-accepts-manda/",Henry Kissinger’s claim about using vaccinations for social and population control is false,,,,,,
371,,,,False,,2019-08-07,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/julie-bishop-never-said-aboriginal-culture-shouldnt-be-taught-in-schools/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP Factcheck examined a posted article by Welcome to Country claiming former Foreign Minister and Liberal Party deputy leader Julie Bishop stating: “Aboriginal children should not be taught their culture in schools”.This article containing a fake Julie Bishop quote is still being shared two years after it was posted, and 13 years after the original media story upon which the false quote was based, was published. The article had been shared by a number of Facebook pages and groups including ‘Indigenous people are joining forces’, ‘Australians vs Neoliberal & Right Wing Politics’, ‘Australian Greens politics, news and discussion’ and ‘The Australian Holocaust’.The posted article features a picture of an angry Julie Bishop along with the headline: “Julie Bishop and the plan to ban teaching Aboriginal culture in schools”. The full article states: “It might not be making national headlines and Julie Bishop may not even be aware, but her comments from over 10 years ago are blowing up on social media”. Welcome to Country describes itself as “an independent Indigenous news/media website. We publish positive Indigenous stories but we’re not afraid to highlight controversial news like this either.”The article was first posted to Facebook on November 7, 2017 and has since been shared over 31,000 times – including around 400 times in 24 hours.According to Welcome to Country’s publicly posted analytics, its story had been viewed over 65,700 times.The AnalysisThe text in the body of the article does not include the quote attributed to Ms Bishop on her picture posted on Facebook. However, the article references another 2006 story published by Melbourne newspaper The Age, stating it exposed Ms Bishop’s endorsement of “a report that called for Aboriginal culture not to be taught in schools”.Gary Johns wrote the ‘Aboriginal Education: Remote Schools and the Real Economy’ report the posted article is based on.The Age article states Ms Bishop, then Education Minister, would consider using the report to frame policy. The report by Gary Johns was titled ‘Aboriginal Education: Remote Schools and the Real Economy’ and was published by the Menzies Research Centre, “the think tank for the Liberal Party of Australia”.Gary Johns is a former Queensland Labor MP and Keating-era minister. After leaving parliament in 1996 Mr Johns joined conservative think-tank, the Institute for Public Affairs, he wrote for The Australian and served as president of the now-defunct Bennelong Society, a conservative advocacy body for indigenous affairs.Mr Johns also authored a number of papers and books including; Waking Up to Dreamtime: The Illusion of Aboriginal Self-determination; Aboriginal Self-determination: The Whiteman’s Dream, Recognise What?; and No Contraception, No Dole: Tackling Intergenerational Welfare.More recently, Mr Johns attracted controversy in his role as commissioner of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, claiming the inclusion of an acknowledgment of country in email signatures indicated a bias towards indigenous charities. According to the Age, the Johns report called Aboriginal culture a “problem” for children: “Too often, educators continue to defer to Aboriginal culture without recognising that Aboriginal culture is the problem. Can a culture that is pre-literate and pre-numerate survive in an education system that is meant to make children literate and numerate? Can a welfare culture that has no work ethic be in a position to prepare its children for school?”The Age stated the Johns report also recommended governments close schools in remote communities if they weren’t financially viable.The Age does not quote Ms Bishop stating “Aboriginal children should not be taught their culture in schools”.The quote from Ms Bishop that most closely resembles this is: “I think what he’s (Johns) saying is that Western schools shouldn’t try to inculcate Aboriginal culture into students, that that’s a role for parents and elders, and I think that’s a very sensible suggestion.” The lead paragraph in the Age story contains the words in the quote attributed to Ms Bishop but attributes the statement to the Johns report.The Welcome to Country story also included an embedded Facebook post of Ms Bishop photo with the same superimposed quote. It was posted by boxer and former NRL player turned mental health advocate Joe Williams.Joe Williams describes himself as a proud Wiradjuri, First Nations Aboriginal man, and played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Penrith Panthers and Canterbury Bulldogs in the 2000s. AAP FactCheck found only one post of the alleged Ms Bishop quote on Facebook that predated Mr Williams’ post by The Sovereign Union, a movement working to assert “genuine pre-existing and continuing sovereignty over First Nations’ territories, lands, waters and natural resources”. It posted a link on October 24, 2017 to the Age story.  It was accompanied by a photo of Indigenous children in tribal dress, superimposed with the words ‘Aboriginal children should not be taught their culture in schools – Education Minister Julie Bishop’.","https://www.welcometocountry.org/julie-bishop-ban-aboriginal-culture-in-schools/?fbclid=IwAR1lstMuqnixdGUbRKN851yvrQYq_O3wxvLZ5uqq-tO3D3tVKcbNTcJTvLI,https://www.facebook.com/groups/18774571981/permalink/10158676612856982,https://www.facebook.com/groups/471920132936739/permalink/2142524519209617,https://www.facebook.com/groups/159389417582255/permalink/1061251037396084,https://www.facebook.com/GrandTheftAustralia/posts/2364405520449224,https://www.theage.com.au/national/stop-aboriginal-culture-lessons-report-20060530-ge2eyb.html,https://www.nintione.com.au/resources/rao/aboriginal-education-remote-schools-and-the-real-economy/,https://www.menziesrc.org/about,https://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/petrie.htm,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/charities-criticise-bizarre-appointment-of-anti-charities-campaigner-as-head-of-regulator,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/author/Gary+Johns,http://www.bennelong.com.au/people.php,https://www.connorcourtpublishing.com.au/Gary-Johns_bymfg_9-0-1.html,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/26/minister-urged-to-investigate-charities-commissioner-gary-johns-offensive-views,https://www.theage.com.au/national/stop-aboriginal-culture-lessons-report-20060530-ge2eyb.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1744943809134778&set=a.1379158519046644&type=3&theater,https://www.joewilliams.com.au/speaking,https://www.facebook.com/SovereignUnion1/posts/2006-article-ms-bishop-has-said-she-will-consider-using-a-report-by-the-menzies-/1455272864593089/",Julie Bishop never said Aboriginal culture shouldn’t be taught in schools,,,,,,

The image is of Dr Jeff Bradstreet. The Washington Post reported that Dr Bradstreet was found dead in June 2015, in North Carolina, with a gunshot wound to his chest. Authorities said he was found his death was caused by “an apparent suicide”.A June 29, 2015 Washington Post article about Dr Bradstreet’s death.Dr Bradstreet was a medical practitioner who claimed that vaccines cause autism and advocated a controversial treatment involving injections with an experimental drug.He reportedly took his own life following a raid on his clinic by the US Food and Drug Administration.AAP Factcheck has found no evidence to support the statement that the five individuals pictured in the post were a “research team”.AAP Factcheck found the woman at the right of the image collage was US Dr Teresa Sievers, who was found bludgeoned to death in her Florida home in June, 2015. Dr Sievers husband and another man are facing second-degree murder charges and will stand trial in October, 2019.The photo of woman at the bottom right of the post is identified as US Dr Lisa Riley, reportedly an emergency room doctor who was found dead in her Georgia, USA, home in July, 2015. Dr Riley’s husband has been charged with her murder.The man in the centre of the collage is identified as Dr Bruce Hedendal, who was found dead in his car in Florida in June, 2015, reportedly from natural causes.The man at the lower right is identified as chiropractor Baron Holt, who died in Florida on June, 21, 2015. The cause of his death is not evident from available reports.In July 2015 the fact checking website Snopes addressed the same claim that “five holistic health doctors” had died under suspicious circumstances and concluded the assertion did not stand up under scrutiny.In May 2017, Snopes addressed a claim that “over 60” holistic health doctors had died in suspicious circumstances within a year and rated the claim false.Also in 2017, the PunditFact fact checking website rated as “Pants on Fire” a story with the same headline as the Facebook post (“Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered”) that appeared on a website Neonnettle.com, which describes itself as a “free, independent news source”.

373,,,,False,,2019-08-06,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/can-you-hear-me-phone-scam-is-fake/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from July 26, 2019 claiming Australians were being defrauded by answering a scam phone caller who repeatedly asks “can you hear me”. Answering “yes” allowed the scammer to record the victim’s voice use it to then “authorise payments or chargers in the victim’s name”.This Facebook post from July 26, 2019 claims Australians are falling victims to a phone scam by simply saying ‘yes’.The information about the alleged scam was contained in an image of a print newspaper story. The story references Sunshine Coast Police in south east Queensland warning anyone who received a “can you hear me” call had “legitimate and serious reasons to be concerned”. “Police say if you get a ‘can you hear me?’ call hang up and don’t respond. If you do respond with a ‘yes’ alert your financial institution, monitor your accounts closely and contact ID Care”, Australia’s national identity and cyber support service. The Facebook post is captioned “be aware”.The same post had been shared by a number of other Facebook users and has collectively amassed over 2,500 shares.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck could not find a source for the original print story pictured in the Facebook post, but found a similar story in the Queensland newspaper the Sunshine Coast Daily on page five of the April 28, 2017 edition.According to another April 29, 2017 Queensland media report the “can you hear me” scam had been spread in America and the United Kingdom.The alleged scam spread to the UK and USA and featured in media reports, including this screen shot from a Florida TV news station WPTV story.An earlier February 2017 UK media report, stated the same “can you hear me” scam was being used to foist unsolicited goods on unsuspecting customers. If the customer refused to pay for the goods, they were played their recorded “yes” answers and threatened with legal action. A January 2017 American media report also cautioned people against being caught by the scam and incurring rogue charges on phone and utility bills and credit cards. Another 2017 report by Florida TV news station WPTV included a re-enactment warning of the “four little words that could cost you big”.AAP FactCheck spoke to Queensland Police, who issued a warning about the scam on its website in April 2017. Queensland Police told AAP FactCheck the scam could only work if the scam caller already had personal details of the victim such as their name, date of birth, address, post code and driver’s licence number. Queensland Police also said it advised anyone who suspected they had fallen victim to the scam to contact ID Care, as it was better placed to assess the risks of any “can you hear me” phone call.ID Care told AAP FactCheck it had received no reports from any individuals who had responded yes to this scam and had then experienced identity fraud or related misuse of accounts. Managing director Professor David Lacey said ID Care had checked with several financial institutions and they had no reports either.“IDCARE does not believe that these calls relate to scam activity. IDCARE also does not believe that an individual’s bank account is at risk,” Prof Lacey told AAP FactCheck.Andy White, CEO of AusPayNet, an Australian payments industry body that protects individuals and business using payment networks, told AAP FactCheck the scam was fake. “Financial institutions use a variety of different security methods to protect customer accounts; payments cannot be authorised with only the word ‘yes’,” Mr White said. “Nonetheless, individuals should always be alert to potential scams, including those by phone … and if you are suspicious of a caller, it is important to hang up immediately.”Western Australia ScamNet, a scam profiling website run by the WA government, debunked the scam in 2017, stating it was being used as a ploy to sell call blockers, apps or devices that help screen unwanted calls. WA ScamNet stated the scam “doesn’t make sense and we do not consider ‘can you hear me? scam’ warnings to be genuine.”Fact checking organisation Snopes also investigated the scam in January 2017, finding it was more likely a “suggestion of a hypothetical crime scheme than a real one that is actually robbing victims of money”. Snopes recorded a verdict of “unproven” but noted no relevant authorities confirmed any documented cases of anyone falling victim to this scam.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157317735982510&set=gm.2355785371312074&type=3&theater,https://www.idcare.org/,https://www.pressreader.com/australia/sunshine-coast-daily/20170429,https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/crime-and-justice/phone-scam-targeting-queenslanders-with-simple-can-you-hear-me-message/news-story/de0ac2f1fddbec8bf05891099f8886f0,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/771996/phone-scam-warning-hang-up-can-you-hear-,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/beware-new-can-you-hear-me-scam/,https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/sunshinecoast/2017/04/26/can-hear-phone-scam/,https://www.auspaynet.com.au/about,https://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/About_us.htm,https://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Scam_types-Attempts_to_gain_your_personal_information-Phishing-Can_you_hear_me_suspected_hoax.htm,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-you-hear-me-scam/",“Can you hear me” phone scam is fake,,,,,,

July 30, 2019.The AnalysisGovernment Services Minister Stuart Robert stated in federal parliament on July 30, 2019 that no debt recovery notices had been issued in the flood-affected north Queensland city of Townsville. The minister’s statement was made in defence of Centrelink’s automated debt recovery system – described by critics as robo-debt – after it was revealed the agency had pursued a debt in May 2019 from the mother of a disability pensioner, who had been dead for six months. Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese asked Mr Robert in parliament if the government’s robo-debt system had issued debt notices to “victims of the Townsville flood” which hit the town in February 2019. The flood left three people dead and damaged more than 3000 homes. The minister replied “at present no victims in the four postcodes around Townsville” received a notice. On July 17, the Guardian Australia reported that Centrelink staff had resumed welfare debt compliance in Townsville. The report quoted Townsville Community Legal Service lawyer Michael Murray, who said there had “been an increase in clients coming in to get advice about robodebts”. Townsville mayor Jenny Hill said resuming welfare debt compliance operations would only make matters worse in a town was still recovering from the floods.On July 29, Labor’s government services spokesman Bill Shorten tweeted the story about Centrelink pursuing a $6,744 debt from Anastasia McCardel’s son, a deceased disability pensioner. “This is why we in Labor say: #ScrapRobodebt” Mr Shorten tweeted. He also issued a media statement, dated and sent to AAP on July 29, titled, ‘Government Must Scrap Robodebt’, which listed another case of a 79-year-old man who received a Centrelink letter about a $67.55 debt from 1998.Mr Robert in turn issued a media release on July 30, titled ‘Bill Shorten Wrong on Townsville Centrelink Debt Claims’. “The last thing people in the Townsville region need are false rumours of debt notices for income compliance being issued,” Mr Robert said. “I want to reassure people in the Townsville region that debt recovery for income compliance recovery has not recommenced and it will not be commencing in the foreseeable future.”On July 31 Mr Shorten tweeted a redacted debt notice issued by Centrelink on July 8 headed “Account Payable” and “Why you owe money”. The notice was addressed to a Townsville postcode (4812) with a payment due on August 6. “Robodebt Minister Stuart Robert told the Parliament no debt recovery was occurring in flood-ravaged Townsville. What’s this?” Mr Shorten tweeted.On July 31 Mr Shorten asked the minister in parliament why he’d given an “absolute assurance” that victims of the Townsville floods hadn’t received debt recovery notices when some received letters as recently as July 8. Mr Robert replied: “During natural disasters – such as cyclones, bushfires or floods – it is routine practice of the Department of Human Services to temporarily suspend all complaints activities within an affected local area. As a general rule this suspension is in place for six months unless extended. I have asked the department to extend the absence of debt recovery in northern Queensland for the foreseeable future until I’m satisfied the region has recovered.”When asked by AAP FactCheck for a response to Mr Shorten’s copy of a debt notice, Mr Robert’s office emailed a transcript of a Sky News interview with the minister dated July 31.The same interview is available on Sky News Twitter. In the interview Mr Robert was asked about the July 8 debt notice Mr Shorten tweeted. He replied “The department has said no debt work or recovery has commenced.” But went on to admit the Department of Human Services had commenced compliance work “of their own volition”. “They commenced compliance work, though, on the 2nd of July. I was informed on 22 July the department of their own volition had commenced. It was my wife’s birthday. I remember it well. And immediately said, no, I don’t want compliance to continue either. So debt halt had gone right the way through from 1 February to today. It’s still in place, and I put a hold on any compliance work on 22 July as well.”Based on this evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Robert’s statement on July 30 was ambiguous. It was not possible to establish the veracity of the minister’s statement.","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live?page=with:block-5d3fcd898f08d0b6ca53a467,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-29/centrelink-robodebt-raised-against-dead-disability-pensioner/11342994,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live?page=with:block-5d3fcd898f08d0b6ca53a467,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live?page=with:block-5d3fcd898f08d0b6ca53a467,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/17/townsville-flood-victims-allegedly-targeted-by-centrelink-robodebt-program,https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/1155676411325140992,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-27/pensioner-hit-with-67-dollar-centrelink-debt-from-last-century/11350180,http://www.robert.com.au/#261597320,https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/1156429541432127488,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/c53753a5-4ecd-4871-a577-d7549f791ed2/&sid=0000,https://www.mhs.gov.au/transcripts/2019-07-31-sky-news-live-interview-david-speers,https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/1156477864222478336",Have debt recovery notices been issued in flood-affected Townsville despite federal government assurances they haven’t?,,,,,,
375,,,,False,,2019-08-05,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/be-happy-quote-attributed-to-shakespeare-is-fake/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post from July 31, 2018 by Heart Touching featuring an image of English writer William Shakespeare.  This Facebook post from July 31, 2018 attributes a “be happy” quote to English poet, William Shakespeare.The post contained a quote that reads: “Shakespeare said: I always feel happy. You know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt, Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. And keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray. Forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live.”Heart Touching describes itself as “an inspirational page offering you enlightening quotes, heart touching stories and motivational articles to make your life more beautiful”. Its Facebook page has over 150,000 likes.The post had been shared more than 11,000 times and attracted more than 80 comments and 3100 reactions.The AnalysisTiffany Stern, Professor of Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama at the University of Birmingham, advised AAP FactCheck the quote had “nothing in common with Shakespeare … and is not even a parody of the way he wrote”.“It is not in early modern (‘Shakespearean’) English. It is not written beautifully. Its sentiments are easy and unabashedly upbeat (Shakespeare is often melancholy and usually complex),” she said.Dr David McInnis, a senior lecturer in Shakespeare Studies from The University of Melbourne agreed with Professor Stern, advising AAP FactCheck, “Shakespeare never wrote anything to that effect”.“For one thing, he only uses the word “expectations” on one occasion, when Roderigo says (in Othello), “The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none,” Dr McInnis said“I have no idea who made up this quotation but it has nothing to do with William Shakespeare.”A poem titled “Before You” by American writer William Arthur Ward poem was appropriated to William Shakespeare.AAP FactCheck analysed the image and found the second part of the quote was attributed to American poet William Arthur Ward from a poem titled, “Before You”. The second part of the Facebook quote was: “… before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray. Forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live”. Mr Ward was born in 1921 in Louisiana and died in 1994. He wrote more than 100 poems, articles and meditations published in various magazines including Reader’s Digest and This Week. He’s listed as one of America’s most quoted writers of “inspirational maxims”.AAP FactCheck found Shakespeare did mention the phrase “life is short” in at least one of his works. In Henry IV Part 1, he wrote: “O gentlemen, the time of life is short! To spend that shortness basely were too long, If life did ride upon a dial’s point, Still ending at the arrival of an hour.”","https://www.facebook.com/HeartT0uching1/photos/a.212094482937414/255626808584181/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/HeartT0uching1/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/shakespeare/stern-tiffany.aspx,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/dr-david-mcinnis,https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/221493-before-you-speak-listen-before-you-write-think-before-you,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/416931.William_Arthur_Ward,https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/life-quotes/,http://www.classicreader.com/book/807/17/",“Be happy” quote attributed to Shakespeare is fake,,,,,,

The post by Money Magazine attributes Mr Murray with the following quote: “The best way to teach your kids about taxes is by eating 30 per cent of their ice-cream.” This Facebook post from July 26, 2019 attributes a quote encouraging parents to eat their kids’ ice cream to Bill Murray.Money’s post asks the question, “How do you teach your kids about money?” and has been shared more than 65 times with more than 230 reactions and over 30 comments. Money Magazine, which started in 1999, says it is, “Australia’s longest-running, highest-selling and most-read personal finance magazine”. Money is followed by over 9000 people on Facebook. A number of other Australian financial service providers have shared the post, including regional Victorian firms Phillipsons Accounting and Financial Planning and Q & S Financial Planning and Melbourne-based Healthy Personal Finances. The AnalysisUS actor Bill Murray has starred in a number of high profile films, including Ghostbusters I and II (1984 and 1989), Groundhog Day (1993), Rushmore (1998) and Lost in Translation (2003), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.In recent years Mr Murray has become a ‘cult’ figure on social media, loved for his unexpected encounters with strangers. He has served drinks to patrons in a Texas bar, photobombed an engagement photo shoot in South Carolina, read construction workers Emily Dickinson’s poetry in New York, and crashed a late-night student party in St Andrews, Scotland and washed their dishes before leaving. US actor and comedian Bill Murray has no verified social media accounts, but is impersonated by a number of users.Despite his status, Mr Murray has no verified social media accounts. The quote used in the Facebook post originates from a tweet from @BillMurray posted on March 24, 2014. The account clearly states in its bio, “I AM NOT BILL MURRAY. This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.”AAP FactCheck was unable to find any reputable record of Mr Murray saying the quote himself. The quote attributed to the actor, in different forms, has been shared on social media in a number of countries including Kenya, the USA, and Canada.Mr Murray hasn’t commented on the number of Twitter accounts posing as him, but several other fact-checking outlets, including Snopes, also found the quote to be fake. Snopes found the quote gained prominence on social media in early 2017 – three years after the initial tweet on March 24, 2014. PolitiFact also conducted a check in 2019 and found the quote on Pinterest, Goodreads and the CBS News. PolitiFact concluded it was unable to find “credible evidence” the quote was from Mr Murray.","https://www.facebook.com/moneymagaus/photos/a.655953974544886/1490938067713135/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/phillipsons.com.au/photos/a.310403522357730/2463929827005078/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/qandsfinancialplanning/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARDjyZ_2GH3iaqus3bQ66n2mWaCVOY-ZumiND0iKz_R8pZTZWZHVuLhUp_jrNuuq-EdysVfmiZE2mXdc&hc_ref=ARTIJLFg8AShn_dB2-x7l9sEBGq9P_wM97lyuFqkCJBx7kv3tuxDjcmGcUJHYrtkJ7M,https://www.facebook.com/HealthyPersonalFinances/,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/bio,https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/bill-murray-once-started-bartending-at-a-festival-and-would-only-serve-tequila-shots/,https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/bill-murray-reddit-ama/,https://twitter.com/BiIIMurray/status/447851038696275968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E447851038696275968&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Ffact-check%2Fbill-murray-ice-cream-taxes%2F,https://www.facebook.com/KiotaSchool/photos/a.585207294878535/1914225048643413/?type=1&theater,https://www.facebook.com/mcgroartyforfreedom/photos/a.475873396080195/774859859514879/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/TurningPointCAN/photos/pb.769939569828955.-2207520000.1530582244./1033695003453409/?type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-murray-ice-cream-taxes/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jan/22/viral-image/no-bill-murray-isnt-serving-tax-advice-ice-cream/",Bill Murray did not tell parents to teach kids about tax by eating 30 per cent of their ice-cream,,,,,,

The caption states: “This is so beautiful”.This Facebook post from July 29, 2019 shows two right whales swimming beneath the Sungai Johor Bridge in Malaysia.The post had been shared more than 100 times and attracted more than 20 comments and 65 reactions.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck analysed the image and found the bridge in the picture was the Sungai Johor Bridge in Malaysia. The bridge is 1.7 kilometres long and is part of the Senai Desaru Expressway which connects the towns of Senai and Desaru across the Johor River in the south of Malaysia. The distance between the two pylons in the image is 500 metres. The whale in the image is longer than the distance between the two pylons.Right whales can grow to a maximum size of 15 metres and can be found in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean.The original photo of the Sungai Johor was taken by Singaporean-based photographer, Chuttersnap and posted to the photo-sharing site, Unsplash, on January 11, 2018.Chuttersnap confirmed to AAP FactCheck the Facebook post showed his image of the Sungai Johor in Malaysia and said “it’s the whales that have been added”. Dr Mike Double, Australian Marine Mammal Centre scientist from the Australian Antarctic Division, told AAP FactCheck the whales in Facebook post were right whales. The Australian Antarctic Division is part of the Department of Environment and Energy, based in Hobart, and is responsible for research activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory and Southern Ocean.Dr Double said right whales grow to “a maximum size of 15 metres” and they had “a very wide distribution but were most commonly found in the North Atlantic, North Pacific (rarely), Southern Ocean (and bordering coastlines)”. “They do not inhabit waters near Malaysia – in theory they could survive there for a while at least,” he said.According to the Australian Museum, the southern right whale inhabits the southern and sub-antarctic oceans except during the winter breeding season. During breeding season they migrate to warmer waters around the southern parts of the African, South American and Australian land masses. The Malaysian bridge in the Facebook post is some 5000km from the east coast of Australia.The Facebook post shows two whales swimming between the two pylons which are 500m apart. The maximum size a right whale grows is around 15m which means over 30 whales would have to line-up head to tail to bridge the space between the pylons. The Facebook shows one whale that is bigger than 500m.AAP FactCheck traced the original altered image of the whales to a Turkish Radio Television and Cinema student who was studying photographic manipulation art and graphic design. The student posted the manipulated image to his Instagram account under the handle, umutreberart.The Instagram post stated the image was his “own digital manipulation study”. “It was created by bringing two photos together. Photoshop was used as a tool,” he wrote on the Instagram post. “Thanks to everyone who conveyed their best wishes to me for the artwork I have done.”","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1627670074035196&set=a.109207062548179&type=3&theater,https://www.sde22.com/our-bridge,https://chuttersnap.com/stills,https://unsplash.com/photos/-gS54SWrHMg,http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-us,https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/mammals/southern-right-whale/,https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Y10WEo4Tt/?igshid=vqqxklqdm4lo",Image of giant whales swimming under a Malaysian bridge is fake,,,,,,

He has described Islam as a ‘fascistic ideology’.”Kristina Keneally, Labor’s Home Affairs spokesperson. July 31, 2019.The AnalysisLabor’s federal Home Affairs spokesperson Kristina Keneally wants the federal government to review and cancel the visa of British writer and activist Raheem Kassam, who is due to address an August 9-11 conference in Sydney. Mr Kassam is scheduled to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Sydney. The CPAC website states the conference is for people who “despaired at the prospect of a Shorten government controlled by militant unions and influenced by the Greens”. It urged delegates to attend CPAC to “join the brave, protect the future”. Mr Kassam was listed to speak along with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott and NSW One Nation senator Mark Latham. The cost of attending the three-day CPAC conference ranged from $149-$599. Senator Keneally has urged for Mr Kassam’s visa to be cancelled because he “has an extensive history of vilifying people on the grounds of their race, religion, sexuality and gender”. AAP FactCheck examined Senator Keneally’s claim Mr Kassam had described the scripture of Islam, the Koran, as “fundamentally evil” and Islam, the Muslim religion, as a “fascistic ideology”.Senator Keneally said that in March 2019 the Morrison government banned British political commentator and writer Milo Yiannopoulos, who described Islam as “an alien and barbaric religion”, and said it should apply the same measure to Mr Kassam. Senator Keneally told the Senate on July 30, 2019: “Mr Kassam has an extensive history of vilifying people on the grounds of their race, religion, sexuality and gender. He has described the (Koran), the holy book of the Muslim faith, as “fundamentally evil”. Mr Kassam has campaigned for “limited migration” against what he describes as “large-scale Muslim immigration”. He has regularly attacked the LGBTI community with homophobic and transphobic comments on social media. We should not allow career bigots – a person who spreads hate speech about Muslims, about women and about gay and lesbian people – to enter our country with the express intent of undermining equity and equality.”AAP FactCheck checked Ms Keneally’s published Senate statement against a parliamentary recording and the wording was correct.In a July 31, 2019 tweet, Mr Kassam accused Ms Keneally of telling “lies” about him and challenged her to repeat her “defamation” outside of the Senate where she is not protected by parliamentary privilege.Senator Keneally repeated the crux of her claims outside parliament on ABC’s Radio National Drive on July 31, 2019, stating it was “ironic” for Mr Kassam to threaten to sue her, given his support of free speech.Mr Kassam has since labelled Senator Keneally a “bub”, “a fraud” and “a fascist” on Twitter. Donald Trump Jr, the son of US President Donald Trump, weighed into the debate with a July 31, 2109 tweet from his verified account accusing the Australian Labor Party of “trying to silence” Mr Kassam because of “his conservative views”. “The insanity needs to stop,” Mr Trump Jr tweeted. The CPAC website described Mr Kassam as “a British political activist, former editor-in-chief of Breitbart News London, and former chief advisor to former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage. He is currently the global editor-in-chief of Human Events, a conservative American digital-only publication.”Mr Kassam was born in Britain to Indian-Tanzanian immigrant parents and described himself as an “Americaphile” and former Muslim. In 2016 he unsuccessfully ran to replace his former boss Nigel Farage as UKIP leader. In 2019 he purchased and relaunched the legacy conservative news outlet Human Events online. AAP FactCheck traced the first part of Ms Keneally’s claim – that Mr Kassam called the Koran “fundamentally evil” – to a March 24, 2018, Instagram post by Mr Kassam, whose handle is @raheemkassam. Mr Kassam states this Instagram post was in response to a supposed threat by Scottish police “to find anonymous Twitter users who say mean things about the left or Islam online. I have a message for them…” The Instagram post includes an image of Mr Kassam with the following text: “I am not anonymous. I am a conservative. I believe in traditional marriage, I believe in limited migration, I believe the Quran (sic) is fundamentally evil, I believe in free speech. Come arrest me fascists.” The post had more than 650 likes. Mr Kassam’s Instagram page is not verified by the platform, but he shared his Instagram handle on his verified Twitter page, confirming the account was his.On July 31, 2019, Mr Kassam told The Sydney Morning Herald he stood by the claim that the Koran was “fundamentally evil” but said “his claim was misunderstood, saying it was evil ‘if you only interpret it fundamentally – and I think that can be said of a lot of religions’.”AAP FactCheck traced the second part of Ms Keneally’s claim – that Mr Kassam described Islam as a “fascistic ideology” – to a BBC Radio 4’s Today interview on August 2, 2018. In the BBC interview, Mr Kassam defended far-right figure Tommy Robinson (Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon), a former English Defence League (EDL) leader released on bail pending an appeal against a contempt of court conviction.The EDL website states it stands for “democracy and the rule of law” and educating the “British public about Islam” who’ve “risen from the English working class to act, lead and inspire in the struggle against global Islamification”. While the audio from the BBC interview is unavailable, Mr Kassam’s comments were reported by two other media platforms. On August 2, 2018, inews.co.uk published a story headlined “Raheem Kassam calls Islam a ‘fascistic ideology’ on BBC as he defends Tommy Robinson’s EDL threat”. The story stated “Raheem Kassam has described Islam as a “fascistic and totalitarian ideology” in a BBC interview”. On August 2, 2018, The Sun also published a story headlined “RIGHT OR WRONG Who is Raheem Kassam? Former Ukip advisor, ex-Breitbart editor and Tommy Robinson supporter”. The story stated: “In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today program on August 2, he (Mr Kassam) defended Robinson after he had been released from prison. He described Islam as a ‘fascistic and totalitarian ideology’.” In a July 5, 2018 tweet Mr Kassam linked Islam to fascism when commenting on a news story about a Muslim mayor in Sheffield banning US President Donald Trump from visiting the city during his UK trip. “What is it with these Muslim mayors that as soon as they get power they start acting like fascists? Oh right yeah sorry that’s Islam…,” Mr Kassam tweeted. Based on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Ms Keneally’s claim that Mr Kassam called the Koran “fundamentally evil” and Islam a “fascist ideology” to be true.","https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/labor-calls-for-visa-ban-on-right-wing-commentator/11371894,https://cpacaustralia.org/about/,https://cpacaustralia.org/about/,https://cpacaustralia.org/about/,https://cpacaustralia.org/registration/,https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/labor-calls-for-visa-ban-on-right-wing-commentator/11371894,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/politicsnow-labor-keeps-heat-on-ministers/news-story/2790485110b509c4de68e2255d876a10,https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/labor-calls-for-visa-ban-on-right-wing-commentator/11371894,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/31/morrison-albanese-coalition-labor-politics-live?page=with:block-5d40c78d8f08d0b6ca53adf9#liveblog-navigation,https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/1156299864147472384,https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/labor-calls-for-visa-ban-on-right-wing-commentator/11371894,https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/1156724323757019138,https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/115655769553892966,https://cpacaustralia.org/speakers/raheem-kassam/,https://www.instagram.com/raheemkassam/,https://www.facebook.com/pg/raheemkassam/about/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/01/breitbart-alum-resuscitate-human-events/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/01/breitbart-alum-resuscitate-human-events/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BgreEHoBrtq/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BgreEHoBrtq/,https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/959924891419119616,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/we-can-t-ban-everyone-who-said-something-offensive-on-twitter-government-mps-defend-visit-of-controversial-activist-20190731-p52cf3.html,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gc4m2,http://www.englishdefenceleague.org.uk/mission-statement/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gc4m2,https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/raheem-kassam-tommy-robinson-bbc/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/6926517/raheem-kassam-ukip-advisor-ex-breitbart-editor-tommy-robinson/,https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/1014549629013291009",Did UK activist Raheem Kassam describe the Koran as ‘fundamentally evil’ and Islam as a ‘fascistic ideology?,,,,,,
379,,,,Mixture,,2019-08-01,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/fake-che-guevara-image-depicts-student-guerilla-theatre/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a July 30, 2019 post by the Australian Culture and Heritage Community (AC&HC) allegedly showing an image of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara aiming a gun at unarmed women. This image was posted above a second image of a group of teenagers in a classroom at a North Carolina school district who are wearing t-shirts that read “Chapel Hill-Carrboro students against gun violence – we’ve got your back”. In this second image there is a photo of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara hanging on the classroom wall.This Facebook post from July 30, 2019 falsely claims to include an image of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara brandishing a gun.The two images are superimposed with text that mocks the teenagers who are protesting against gun violence. The top image states Che Guevara was “Castro’s executioner”, referring to former Cuban Prime Minister and President Fidel Castro. The bottom image states “students discussing gun violence in a room with a poster glorifying a … mass murdering communist”. The Australian Culture & Heritage Community post states: “Marxism relies on the Leftist being an ignoramus to be a successful useful-idiot”. The AC&HC states on its Facebook page it is, “a pro-Australian Nationalist & Patriotic page with a focus on Aussie Pride and white-European cultural matters; we have a particular bent towards exposing the workings of Leftardology (a derogatory term for Far Left ideology)”.The post had been shared over 240 times, and had over 210 reactions and more than 15 comments.The AnalysisErnesto ‘Che’ Guevara was a prominent communist figure in the 1956 -1959 Cuban Revolution who acted as an executioner (or ordered the execution) of suspected traitors and deserters. The Encyclopaedia Britannica states: “After his execution by the Bolivian army, he was regarded as a martyred hero by generations of leftists worldwide, and his image became an icon of leftist radicalism and anti-imperialism.”Screenshot from the CISPES website showing American university student guerilla theatre. The first image in the Facebook post allegedly shows Guevara pointing a gun at two women, however the face of the man holding the gun is obscured and there are people with backpacks and a makeshift smoke machine in a plastic bucket in the background.An investigation by fact-checking site Snopes concluded the image was taken of a “guerilla theatre” performance at Emory College in Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 1989.Snopes contacted the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), which posted the picture on its website along with a caption dated 1989 which stated “Guerilla Theatre at Emory College”. CISPES confirmed the image was as stated and provided images of the physical photograph which showed the words “Emory College Atlanta Mar 89” written on the back. Emory College, now known as Emory University, confirmed to AFP Fact Check in an emailed statement on June 25, 2019 the image was taken on campus in 1989. “The photo was taken of a theatrical demonstration taking place on Emory’s campus to raise awareness of humanitarian crises created by war in El Salvador and Guatemala and of US military involvement in that war,” Emory University Archivist John Bence said. “It was entitled ‘Guerilla Theater’ but It was not theatrical production, per se.”Emory University describes itself as “a top-ranked private institution recognized internationally for its outstanding liberal arts colleges, graduate and professional schools”.According to AFP Fact Check, a story published in the student-run university newspaper the Emory Wheel, on March 24, 1989 further confirmed “guerilla theatre” demonstrations took place and featured in an on-campus picture with a similar background to the Facebook image. The Emory Wheel story picture caption states: “ECAN (Emory Central America Network) built champas in the quad to symbolize living conditions in Central America”.Che Guevara was executed in 1967, almost 20 years before the 1989 Emory “theatre” photograph was taken. The second image in the Facebook post was taken at the East Chapel Hill High School in North Carolina, America. The photo accompanies a March 15, 2018 Associated Press story headlined “From somber to angry, school walkout protests vary in tenor”. The story is about students quitting class to protest gun violence. The photo caption reads, “Students discuss gun violence ahead of a walkout at East Chapel Hill High School on Wednesday, March 14, 2018, in Chapel Hill, N.C.” The AP story references the Che Guevara photo hanging on the classroom wall. The same photo was published by CNN as part of a March 17, 2018, story headlined “This is why kids are wearing orange during the National Walk Out”. The story is about the school students walkouts over gun violence. The same image of Che Guevara can be seen hanging in the background of the classroom.","https://www.facebook.com/Australiancultureandheritage/photos/a.611893635513084/2297885806913850/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fidel-Castro,https://www.facebook.com/pg/Australiancultureandheritage/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.collinsdictionary.com/submission/18296/leftard,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Che-Guevara,https://www.britannica.com/event/Cuban-Revolution,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Che-Guevara,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/che-guevara-executing-women/,http://www.cispes.org/old/History/Photo_gallery/theater.html,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-not-photo-argentine-revolutionary-che-guevara,http://www.emory.edu/home/about/index.html,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-not-photo-argentine-revolutionary-che-guevara,https://www.facebook.com/emorywheel/,https://www.chccs.org/echhs,https://apnews.com/824a04eecb8e4fc0875d9a0be8273c53,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/14/us/color-orange-in-national-school-walkout-trnd/index.html",Fake Che Guevara image depicts student guerilla theatre,,,,,,

The post attributes the quote to Australia’s first prime minister Edmund Barton from 1907.This Facebook post from July 10, 2019 attributes a quote on immigration to Australia’s first prime minister Edmund Barton from 1907.The quote reads, “In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an Australian and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person’s becoming in every facet an Australian, and nothing but an Australian. There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an Australian, but something else also, isn’t an Australian at all. We have room for but one flag, the Australian flag … We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language … and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the Australian people.”On his Facebook page Graeme Jeffs campaigns for the “full restoration of our lawful 1901 constitution” and states “this is your call to arms, your call to unite under the one banner”.The AnalysisEdmund Barton was Australian prime minister from federation in 1901 until he resigned in 1903 to become a High Court judge, a position he held until his death in 1920. During his term as prime minister Sir Edmund also served as External Affairs Minister, responsible for foreign policy and immigration. The post claims Sir Edmund shared his ideas on immigration in 1907 when he was a high court judge. AAP FactCheck found no evidence of Sir Edmund ever making this statement at any time during his career – as prime minister, External Affair Minister or as High Court judge.Edmund Barton was Australian prime minister from federation in 1901 until he resigned in 1903. During his term as prime minister he also served as External Affairs Minister, responsible for immigration.The National Library of Australia (NLA) told AAP FactCheck it could find no evidence of Sir Edmund making this statement and based on the library’s resources “we can safely say that this speech was not originally made by Barton”.The NLA said it examined the Barton papers that related to the Federation campaign, the 1900 London conference, his prime ministership from 1901-1903, family correspondence, photographs and newspaper cuttings.The NLA also examined Barton’s speeches and confirmed there was nothing resembling the quote attributed to Sir Edmund on Facebook. It also checked summary descriptions of the full collection of Sir Edmund’s papers and found no evidence or description of a similar speech. The NLA also searched parliamentary debates for the decade 1900-1910 and found nothing by Sir Edmund or any other member of parliament. The Parliament House research paper The immigration debate in Australia: from Federation to World War One does not make any reference to this quote either. AAP FactCheck found the quote was attributed to another head of state from the same period – Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th US president. Mr Roosevelt became president in 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley and served until 1909. Aged 43, Mr Roosevelt was America’s youngest president. The quote in the Facebook post is exactly the same as a section of a letter Roosevelt wrote in 1919, except he writes about immigrants becoming American and being loyal to America. The letter is held at The Library of Congress, the research arm of the US Congress. The letter was sent to the American Defense Society, an early 20th century nationalist organisation. Roosevelt was the honorary president. The letter was dated three days before his death on January 6, 1919 aged 60, and proved to be Roosevelt’s last public message. In the letter he reiterated his consistently-held strong belief in the complete assimilation of immigrants.","https://www.facebook.com/OurLawfulConstitution/photos/a.1857891210987879/2123537821089882/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/OurLawfulConstitution/about/?ref=page_internal,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/barton-sir-edmund-toby-71,https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2049726,http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-224441825,http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-224441684/findingaid,https://bit.ly/310K4S0,https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/ImmigrationDebate,https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/theodore-roosevelt/,https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss38299.mss38299-412_0184_0456/?sp=119&r=0.436,0.035,0.555,0.344,0,http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/americandefsoc/bioghist.html,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137286499_5",Immigration quote attributed to Prime Minister Barton is by US President Theodore Roosevelt,,,,,,

The table, with figures in Australian dollars, ranks the Sydney Roosters rugby league football team as the second most valuable in the world with a value of $6.54 billion behind the USA Dallas Cowboys NFL club ($7.11 billion). This Facebook post from July 23, 2019 ranks the Sydney Roosters rugby league football club as the second most valuable team in the world, with a value of $6.54 billion.The post was shared more than 270 times and attracting 416 comments and more than 500 reactions. The NRL Post has more than 10,000 Facebook followers despite providing no details about its origin or purpose on Facebook or Instagram. The AnalysisAmerican business magazine Forbes publishes an annual list of the world’s top 50 most valuable sports teams based on profits before “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization”. It published its latest list on July 22, 2019. Number one on the Forbes list was the Dallas Cowboys gridiron team with a value of $US5 billion ($A7.2 billion) followed by the New York Yankees baseball team in second position with a value of $US4.6 billion ($A6.6 billion). The Sydney Roosters are not on the list and nor is there any Australian sports teams on the list. Fox Sports Australia also posted the Forbes top 10 sports teams on Twitter on July 23, 2019, ranking the New York Yankees as the second most valuable team as reported by Forbes.

The captions circulating Facebook with the same article criticised Premier Andrews labeling him a “supporter of Islamic & Left Wing Terrorism” and “Comrade Dan being the little Communist is”.The Unshackled Facebook page states its mission is to “advance conservative and libertarian ideals while protecting free speech and fighting against the PC Culture” and that it endeavours to cover “topics and story angles that the mainstream media usually chooses to ignore”.The AnalysisThere have been several public protests against Bendigo’s Islamic Community Centre since a permit was approved in June 2014, including a mock beheading outside Bendigo council offices by Blair Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Christopher Neil Shortis. They were subsequently convicted of inciting serious contempt towards Muslims and each fined $2,000.The Community Centre received a $400,000 grant from the Victorian government to assist in building the first phase of the project, a sports and community hall.

Beneath the image the caption reads: “Halal Certified Pork – Anyone still not sure halal is a scam?”.This Facebook post from July 12, 2019 shows a tin of canned stewed pork with a halal certification sign on its label. Fair Dinkum Mate 2 is a backup page for the original Fair Dinkum Mate page which was “closed down by Facebook”, according to a post on the page on March 2018.

In dietary standards, halal refers to food and beverages Muslims are permitted to consume. This is done through the ritual method in which animals are slaughtered called  Zibah or Zabihah. The opposite of halal is haram, which means unlawful or forbidden. The Department of Islamic Development Malaysia issued a statement in January 2017 showing this image of canned stewed pork with a fake label featuring a halal logo. Pork in the Islamic faith is considered especially haram because it is viewed as unclean and according to the Koran, “He [Allah] has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah.”Australian National University doctor Shakira Hussein wrote about the campaign against halal certification in a University of Melbourne research journal saying, “Muslim‐minority societies reveal the shift in the representation of Muslims from a visible, alien presence to a hidden, covert threat”.“Supporters of the campaign against halal certification described it as a ‘religious tax’ which effectively forced non‐Muslims to subsidise Muslim dietary choices, despite clarifications from business leaders that the decision to seek certification was taken on strictly commercial grounds in order to expand their market and obtain export deals,” Dr Hussein wrote. “Disgust arises from the discovery that the Muslim Other has infiltrated and usurped our’ food without our knowledge and consent.”A spokesperson from Ing Lee (E.M.) Trading, the manufacturer of the canned stewed pork featured in the Facebook post, told AAP FactCheck the image “does not depict its brand King Ma Liang”.“Our [stewed pork] product is strictly non halal. We follow strict guidelines,” the spokesperson said. “It looks manipulated. My original picture of the product does not have Halal logo at all.”The spokesperson directed AAP FactCheck to the company website which displays images of its canned meat products where there was an image of the canned stewed pork shown in the Facebook post – minus a halal certification logo.The company does make other products with Halal certification, including some canned fish products and vermicelli noodles.The Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM), which oversees halal certification, released a statement in Malay on Facebook in January 2017 denying it ever issued a halal logo for a “haram product” Pork is a haram product.JAKIM had issued the same statement three times before, in September 2015, November 2015 and again in June 2016. According to a Google translation of the statement, JAKIM was alerted by complainants about two locations alleged selling a stewed pork product with a halal certification logo. Its investigation “did NOT find the product on the market”. “JAKIM did not rule out the possibility that it was an image that was intentionally edited by placing the Halal logo,” the translated statement read. Accompanying the Facebook statement was a can of stewed pork with a halal certification logo on it and a red sign reading: “PALSU!” which translates to “False!”.

The poll asked if children should be taught Arabic numbers in taxpayer-funded schools. This Facebook post from July 15, 2019 claims Alan Jones carried out a poll asked if children should be taught Arabic numbers in taxpayer-funded schools.According to the poll, 88 per cent of 1876 respondents answered no. The “lunatics” post was accompanied by a caption describing the results as “bloody scary”. It stated: “What hope do we have … these are the ones that vote for the Liberal party.”The post was shared almost 130 times, and had over 300 comments and 370 reactions.‘The lunatics have taken over the asylum’ is a page with over 63,000 likes that posts on current affairs and social issues. The page’s about section includes the 1854 Eureka Stockade pledge: “We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.”The AnalysisThe radio 2GB website claims Alan Jones is “Australia’s most popular talkback presenter”. “Alan Jones is a phenomenon,” it states. “He’s described by many as the nation’s greatest orator and motivational speaker. Alan has the mind and capacity to make complex issues understandable to the largest Breakfast audience in Australia.” The second 2019 radio survey results showed Alan Jones remained at the top of the Sydney AM breakfast market. AAP FactCheck found there was no July 15 posts on the verified blue tick Alan Jones Facebook page nor any posts about this poll. Nor does it exist on the Radio 2GB’s website or the 2GB Facebook or Twitter pages.Alan Jones’ official Twitter page shows the top rating breakfast radio host has not tweeted since March 29.The screen shot of the alleged poll bears some elements of both Facebook and Twitter style and features the profile picture from Mr Jones’ official Twitter page. However Mr Jones has not tweeted since March 29.A producer for Alan Jones told AAP FactCheck the poll was most likely a fake. “That’s never been a discussion on air or social media or anywhere on the show,” Mr Jones’ producer said.Regarding Arabic numerals, they are the same decimal system numerals.They’re a set of 10 symbols that were later represented as numbers in the decimal system, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Hindu-Arabic numerals date back to the 6th or 7th century in India before they were introduced to western Europe in the 12th century. AAP FactCheck found a similar poll was conducted in America by the CivicScience Inc, a research firm based in Pittsburgh to “tease out prejudice”. The results, which showed 56 per cent of respondents said that schools in America shouldn’t teach Arabic numerals, were tweeted by CEO John Dick on May 12, 2019 with the caption “The saddest and funniest testament to American bigotry we’ve ever seen in our data”. The results were widely retweeted with explainers published the following day pointing out Arabic numerals are the same as decimal system numerals.","https://www.facebook.com/637395922961075/photos/a.765718530128813/2596638290370152/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/The-lunatics-have-taken-over-the-asylum-637395922961075/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.2gb.com/show/the-alan-jones-breakfast-show/,https://mumbrella.com.au/sydney-radio-ratings-kyle-and-jackie-o-and-alan-jones-both-make-gains-in-breakfast-576976,https://www.facebook.com/SackAlanJones/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/135286083174397/,https://www.2gb.com/,https://www.facebook.com/2gb873/,https://twitter.com/2GB873,https://twitter.com/alanjones?lang=en,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hindu-Arabic-numerals,https://twitter.com/jdcivicscience/status/1127285936977522688,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/teaching-arabic-numerals/,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/5/13/1857360/-Poll-says-that-56-of-Americans-don-t-want-kids-taught-Arabic-numerals-We-have-some-bad-news",Alan Jones did not conduct poll on children learning Arabic numbers in school,,,,,,

If the stalk is black then the banana is naturally ripened.”SA Wellness Centre is a chiropractic business based in O’Halloran Hill, Adelaide which offers services in physiotherapy and nutrition through to wellness workshops, yoga and meditation classes.The post had been shared more than 170 times and attracted more than 20 comments and 100 reactions.The AnalysisThe Australian Banana Growers’ Council (ABGC), the national peak industry body for Australia’s commercial banana growers, told AAP FactCheck “the chemical ripening process is essentially the same as the natural ripening process, just in a more controlled environment” and that both were triggered by the same hormone, ethylene gas.According to Scot Nelson, a doctor in plant pathology at the University of Hawaii, bananas emit ethylene gas, a natural plant hormone that accelerates ripening by converting the starch it stores into sugar. As more ethylene builds up in a banana, the riper it will become.Bananas could be affected by diseases like senescent spots (L) or crown rot (R) which could give them visual characteristics similar to ripe bananas.All fruits do this, but bananas produce a large amount, which is why they will ripen other fruits in close vicinity. An ABGC spokesperson told AAP FactCheck bananas were chemically ripened in Australia by placing them “into a cold room, where ethylene gas is introduced so the bananas start to transpire. When they take in oxygen and ethylene together, the bananas use that as energy to convert starches to sugars – essentially this is ripening”.The ripening rooms have to be temperature-controlled 15 to 20 degrees, the humidity level set to around 90 to 95 per cent to induce uniform ripening, and the carbon dioxide concentration kept below one per cent to avoid delaying the ripening process, according to the Postharvest Centre at the University of California.The Postharvest Centre is a research facility which studies the “postharvest quality, safety and marketability of fresh horticultural products” and the “technology that enhances the quality, safety and marketability” of these products.ABGC told AAP FactCheck bananas which go through chemical ripening and those which ripen naturally do not show any visible differences and that chemically ripened bananas have no different markings to those ripened naturally.“Bananas will at times have different marks, caused by natural events or as they continue to ripen,” the ABGC spokesperson said.“There is no difference related to how they have been ripened. Similarly, common banana varieties will change from green to yellow as they ripen. Sometimes, you may find that a less ripe banana still has some green colouring.”A banana with a black stalk, similar to those featured in the Facebook post, could also be experiencing a pathological disorder called “crown rot”, according to the Postharvest Centre. Crown rot was caused by a fungi which attacks the cut surface of the banana hands and spreads into the finger neck into the fruit.”Brown spots or flecks on a banana peel could also indicate the banana is experiencing a disease called “senescent spots”. Small groups of cells appear in the outer peel, caused when over-mature fruit are sent to a ripening facility, according to Dr Scot Nelson.","https://www.facebook.com/sawellnesscentre/photos/a.445457205482514/2760071954021016/?type=3&theater,https://sawellnesscentre.com.au/,https://abgc.org.au/about-us/,https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/site/Bio.aspx?ID=NELSOSCO,https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/nelsons/banana/ripeningbunchmanagement.pdf,https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/nelsons/banana/ripeningbunchmanagement.pdf,http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Commodity_Resources/Fact_Sheets/Datastores/Fruit_English/?uid=9&ds=798,http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/About_Us/,http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Commodity_Resources/Fact_Sheets/Datastores/Fruit_English/?uid=9&ds=798,https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/nelsons/banana/ripeningbunchmanagement.pdf",There’s no visible difference between bananas ripened chemically or naturally,,,,,,

The post states that Ned Kelly “had the spirit that Australians needs today”. This Facebook post from May 7, 2019 does not feature Ned Kelly. The image is of German communist philosopher Friedrich Engels who died 10 years after the famous Australian bushranger.The post had been shared over 25,000 times and attracted over 740 comments and 640 reactions.  Many of the comments argued whether Ned Kelly was a villain or a hero, while many other comments cast doubt on the photo.   The AnalysisAccording to the National Museum of Australia (NMA) Ned Kelly was a bushranger who was born around 1855 the eldest son of eight children to Irish parents. His father John was a convict who’d been transported to Australia for stealing pigs and his mother Ellen was a migrant.The NMA states Ned Kelly grew up experiencing firsthand the prejudice of the Victorian police. Aged 16, he served three years in prison for horse theft. On his release he formed the Kelly Gang which included his brother Dan and friends Joseph Byrne and Steve Hart. All four had criminal records. The Kelly Gang were outlawed in 1878 after robbing banks and killing Victorian police in a shootout.  Police captured Ned Kelly and the other three gang members were killed in a famous 1880 siege at Glenrowan, a small country Victorian town, where they wore heavy body armour. Ned was tried and executed aged 25 in Melbourne in November, 1880. Despite their crimes, the NMA states the Kelly Gang became Australian folklore heroes for their stand against corrupt officials.The real Ned Kelly.  The only traits Mr Kelly and Mr Engels appear to have shared were that they were both radicals and had bushy beards. The photograph in the May 7, 2019 Facebook post shows a man who looks much older than 25, the age Ned Kelly was hanged.AAP FactCheck found the photo published on Facebook was of the famous German socialist philosopher Friedrich Engels, who collaborated with Karl Marx to create communism and co-authored with Marx The Communist Manifesto published in 1848. According to the British Library The Communist Manifesto formed the basis for the modern communist movement, arguing that capitalism would inevitably self-destruct and be replaced by socialism and ultimately communism. Mr Engels edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital after Marx’s death. He was born in (former Prussia) Germany in 1820, 35 years before Ned Kelly was born and died in 1895, 10 years after Mr Kelly’s death. The only traits Mr Kelly and Mr Engels appear to have shared were that they were both radicals and had similar facial hair and bushy beards.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158439959179867&set=pb.763624866.-2207520000.1564015468.&type=3&theater,https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/ned-kelly,https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/australia/the-kelly-gangs-last-stand.aspx,https://cv.vic.gov.au/stories/a-diverse-state/ned-kelly/suit-of-armour-worn-by-ned-kelly/,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kelly-edward-ned-3933,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Engels,http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106572.html,https://theconversation.com/everyone-knows-about-karl-marx-but-what-about-friedrich-engels-95241",Ned Kelly post depicts German communist philosopher Friedrich Engels,,,,,,

The image is accompanied by the headline  “Australian taxpayers fund terror lessons where kids introduced to Jihad”.This Facebook post from July 21, 2019, shows an image from a 2016 children festival in Gaza – not jihad lessons funded by Australian taxpayers.The Revive Australia Movement describes itself as a” decentralised, peaceful, grassroots people’s movement who are not left or right. At our core we aim to protect individual and national sovereignty.” Its list of aims include “end forced preferential voting”, “citizen initiated referendums”, “return public assets” “reinstitute a People’s Bank”.The AnalysisRevive Australia’s post contains a link to a story with the same headline from a website called The Politics Online, which publishes news-style posts, many of which are critical of Islam. The story is based on a July 14, 2019 Tweet by Iranian-born Australian Imam Mohamad Tawhidi, a self-described Islamic “peace advocate” and “reformist Imam”. The tweet, which is embedded in the Politics Online story, states “Hamas teaches young children to kill Jewish children, simply because they’re Israeli. Who pays for these events to brainwash children into becoming future terrorists? Is it funded by an educational committee, that is funded by the government, that is paid by our taxes in “aid”? The Twitter post had been retweeted over 4,200 times and had over 5,500 likes and over 360 comments.The Facebook post links to a story which is based on a Tweet from an Imam who was exposed as an imposter by the ABC Radio investigative program Background Briefing in 2017.The Iman of Peace’s blue tick Twitter account has almost half a million followers.ABC Radio’s Background Briefing investigative program found in 2017 Imam Tawhidi was an imposter, a “virtually unknown Shia preacher who had arrived back in Australia after nine years spent overseas, mainly in Iran and Iraq”. The bachelor’s and master’s degree in Islamic theology he claimed to have from Iran’s Al-Mustafa University did not exist and “he had no mosque”. The  Politics Online story states that the Imam Tawhidi Tweet reveals “how the Palestinian leadership exploits foreign aid from Western countries to introduce children to jihad” and “warns the Australian people regarding the irresponsible use of their tax money”. In 2018/19, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) estimated it provided $38.3 million in official development assistance to the Palestinian Territories (PTs) – West Bank and the Gaza Strip. For 2019/20 it budgeted $42.6 million. “Australian aid to the PTs is a practical and genuine demonstration of our long-standing support for the Middle East peace process,” DFAT states. “Australia’s assistance helps strengthen the economic and social foundations of a future Palestinian state.”According to DFAT, aid is channeled through Australia Award Scholarships at Masters’ level in priority sectors, to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to provide basic services (education and health), livelihood opportunities and protection for Palestinian refugees and the UN’s Palestinian Territories Humanitarian Fund (Administered by the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs – OCHA) for humanitarian assistance in areas including health, water sanitation and hygiene, food security and protection.Australia cut funding to the World Bank’s Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Palestinian Recovery and Development Program in mid-2018 after then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop sought assurances the aid wasn’t being channeled to Palestinians convicted of politically-motivated violence. At the time, Ms Bishop said, “I am confident that previous Australian funding to the PA through the World Bank has been used as intended.” “However, I am concerned that in providing funds for this aspect of the PA’s operations, there is an opportunity for it to use its own budget to [fund] activities that Australia would never support.”The image of the young boys with guns comes from a children’s festival held on May 2016 in Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip. A 3min8sec video of the festival was posted on Facebook showing young children dancing, waving flags and play-acting on an open-air stage in front of seated adults. Some children appear on stage dressed in military fatigues doing drills with toy guns, holding guns to the head of an “Israeli” soldier, throwing rocks and driving a miniature tank flying the flag of Israel. The video was posted by the Israeli not-for-profit organisation, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), which states it “bridges the language gap between the West and the Middle East”.","https://www.facebook.com/reviveaustraliamovement/photos/a.2186353034916346/2325571090994539/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/reviveaustraliamovement/about/?ref=page_internal,https://reviveaustraliamovement.info/,http://www.thepolitics.online/2019/07/australian-taxpayers-fund-terror.html?fbclid=IwAR2GvNO1ax7fjaJcYX6-KgWYiyAfT5SE3MSX2cirHNTO-O1rs4Qw0zR2BiI,https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1150321456565194754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1150321456565194754&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thepolitics.online%2F2019%2F07%2Faustralian-taxpayers-fund-terror.html,https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-23/imam-tawhidi-the-problem-with-the-medias-favourite-muslim/8643726,https://dfat.gov.au/geo/palestinian-territories/development-assistance/Pages/development-assistance-in-palestinian-territories.aspx,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-02/australia-ends-direct-aid-to-palestinian-authority/9932828,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10154134506659717,https://www.facebook.com/pg/memri.org/about/?ref=page_internal",Australian taxpayers don’t fund children’s terrorism or jihad lessons,,,,,,
388,,,,,,2019-07-24,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/innisfail-in-north-qld-is-not-an-agent-orange-town/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post titled “Agent Orange town in QLD” which states “The Australian Army tested chemical weapons on a town which now has deaths from cancer 10 times the state average.” The March 26, 2019 post references a media story written by Matthew Benns and Frank Walker and published on May 18, 2008 in the Sydney Sunday newspaper the Sun Herald. This Facebook post from March 26, 2019, republishes a 2008 story which claims Agent Orange was sprayed in a water catchment area for Innisfail in Queensland’s far north in 1966.The story states that in 1966 “military scientists sprayed the toxic defoliant Agent Orange in the jungle that is part of the water catchment area for Innisfail in Queensland’s far north at the start of the Vietnam War”.The post is accompanied by a photo of an airplane flying over a forest and creating a long spray trail. The post has been shared over 11,000 times and has attracted over 2,400 reactions and over 30 comments.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found the photo which accompanies the post was taken in Vietnam in 1962, not in Innisfail, Northern Queensland in 1966. It shows a United States Air Force Fairchild UC-123B Provider transport aircraft spraying defoliant in South Vietnam in 1962 during Operation Ranch Hand. The image was sourced to a 1984 book by Dana Bell titled, “Air War over Vietnam”, Volume IV. The same image has been used a number of times to illustrate the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam by media publications including the Huffington Post and Associated Press in Washington.The published correction about the incidence of cancer deaths in Innisfail following the alleged spraying of Agent Orange. The correction was not contained in the Facebook post.According to the US Air Force National Museum, Operation Ranch Hand was a military mission employed during the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1971 to defoliate thick jungle landscape and destroy enemy crops using US Air Force C-123 aircraft to spray millions of gallons of chemicals. In 1965, Ranch Hand began using a very effective defoliant called Agent Orange. On May 18, 2008, the Sydney Sunday newspaper, the Sun Herald, published a story titled “Agent Orange town” which stated: “Australian Army tested chemical weapons on a town which now has deaths from cancer 10 times the state average. It said military scientists sprayed Agent Orange in an area that is part of the water catchment area for Innisfail in 1966”.The cancer claim was also disputed by Queensland Health’s Brad McCulloch on May 18, 2008. “There is a 0.1 per cent difference in the rate of which new cancers are diagnosed in Innisfail compared to Queensland,” Mr McCulloch told the ABC. Then Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told the ABC she would investigate the Agent Orange claims and contact the Federal Government and the Australian Defence Force.A week after the original story was published on May 25, 2008, a correction was published which stated: “This article says that deaths from cancer in Innisfail were 10 times the Queensland average. Queensland Health says that the rate of death from cancer in the Innisfail area is not significantly higher than the rest of Queensland.” This correction is pasted at the top of the original story but was not included in the Facebook post. Three weeks after original publication on June 9, 2008 a defence department statement was published by the ABC refuting the claims. The statement read in part. “Our search of archived reports shows that no trials have been carried out by defence scientists in the Innisfail area using Agent Orange. One small scale defoliation trial was conducted in the Gregory Falls area near Innisfail in 1966 to evaluate the effect of herbicides on tropical vegetation. The chemicals used were commonly available at the time. The herbicide 24D, a component of Agent Orange, was not tested.”According to the Australian cancer atlas, which was released in April 2017, Innisfail has 35 per cent above the national average of excess deaths due to all cancers. The highest incidence of 37 per cent above the national average for excess deaths was due to brain cancer. 34 per cent for lung cancer and 32 for leukemia.The online cancer atlas also found Queensland had the highest incidence rates for all cancers combined from 2008-2012 (the latest figures available) – a rate of 532 cases of cancer per 100,000 people. It further found people living in remote areas of Australia are 1.2 times more likely to die from all cancers combined compared with major cities. Innisfail is a small regional town in far north Queensland located 100km south of Cairns.The Australian Cancer Atlas was funded by FrontierSI (formerly the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information), Cancer Council Queensland, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and Queensland University of Technology.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218844919013205&set=a.3288854459386&type=3&theater,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UC-123B_Ranch_Hand_spraying_1962.jpg,https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/196059/fairchild-c-123k-provider/,https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2013/07/10/agent-orange-vietnam-veterans_n_3572598.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-to-pay-at-least-47-million-to-veterans-over-agent-orange-claims-2015-6?IR=T,https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/195955/down-in-the-weeds-ranch-hand/,https://www.smh.com.au/national/agent-orange-town-20080518-gdse5b.html,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-18/agent-orange-scare-soldier-witnessed-rainforest/2440050,https://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2269058.htm,https://atlas.cancer.org.au/app,https://www.qut.edu.au/news?news-id=116397,https://atlas.cancer.org.au/about/",Innisfail in north Qld is not an “agent orange town”,,,,,,

Rudd is visible on the bottom left corner of the mural. Van T. Rudd describes himself as a “social justice activist” and his “sci-fi political art” as “Ventolin for the breath of resistance”. He is also the nephew of former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd.The Voice of Australia describes itself as being “against animal cruelty – particularly Halal Ritual Slaughter & the Islamisation of Australia”. Its Facebook group has over 39,000 likes.The Facebook post depicting the mural had been shared more than 570 times and attracted more than 120 comments and 1200 reactions.The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found the image posted by The Voice of Australia was a doctored version of Mr Rudd’s original mural.The original mural was completed by Mr Rudd on May 20, 2017 on the corner of Donald and Barkley Streets in Footscray, Melbourne. The original depicted the bulldog mascot urinating on One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. The face of One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson was painted over by the local council following complaints from the public.Mr Rudd said the purpose of the mural was to “show that racism and extreme right-wing politics won’t be tolerated in Melbourne’s west. And shouldn’t be tolerated anywhere of course.”Here’s a Google Map image of where the wall Mr Rudd painted is located in Footscray, Melbourne. The face of Senator Hanson was painted over by the Maribyrnong City Council a day after it was completed, leaving just the urinating bulldog on the wall. The council’s chief executive officer Stephen Wall said it had received “numerous complaints” and it was “offensive”.Sudanese-born TV presenter Yassmin Abdel-Magied’s face was photo-shopped into the mural where Senator Hanson’s face was and shared on social media.

July 22, 2019The AnalysisA report by Ernst & Young accounting firm titled ‘Monetary policy won’t be enough for Australia to generate wages growth’ said the Reserve Bank’s plan to reduce the unemployment rate to generate faster wage growth and higher inflation may not work. Ernst & Young (EY) chief economist Jo Masters said there were now 462,000 more Australians looking for work than there were job vacancies. Ms Masters said low-interest rates alone wouldn’t lift wages if employers could not find staff. “Until we plug the gap between labour supply and labour demand it will be difficult to generate significant wage growth in Australia,” the report said. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson told Breakfast TV’s The Today Show economists don’t always get it right. She said the country was in “dire straits” and more money needed to be invested in infrastructure projects such as water and coal to create more employment and solve the problem of more people looking for work than there were jobs. AAP FactCheck examined Pauline Hanson’s claim there were 462,000 unemployed people in Australia.The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to June 2019 showed there were 692,700 unemployed people in Australia. Seasonably adjusted, the figure was 711,500. The number of 462,000 quoted by Pauline Hanson on breakfast television comes from an EY report, sent to AAP FactCheck by EY, and refers to the gap between the number of people unemployed compared to the number of job vacancies. The original number of job vacancies in Australia stands at 230,800 and 241,500 when seasonally adjusted, according to the most recent May figures from the ABS released on July 4, 2019.Using the latest ABS original figures, the original number of unemployed in June was 692,700 while the number of job vacancies in May was 230,800. The difference or the gap between these two figures is 461,900, or rounded-up 462,000, people looking for work for whom there are no jobs. This is the figure quoted in the EY report.Based on this evidence AAP FactCheck finds the claim made by Pauline Hanson that there were 462,000 people unemployed in Australia was false. The One Nation leader appears to have misread or misunderstood an EY economist’s report and mixed up the figures. She used the job gap rate of 462,000 – the gap between the number of unemployed people versus job vacancies – instead of the much higher unemployment figure of 692,700 – 711,500 for June 2019.","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/low-rates-won-t-boost-wages-rba-and-government-warned-20190721-p5298e.html,https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1153048158445817856,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6202.0Jun%202019?OpenDocument,https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1153048158445817856,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6354.0May%202019?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6202.0Jun%202019?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6354.0May%202019?OpenDocument","Are there 462,000 unemployed people in Australia?",,,,,,

July 18, 2019.The AnalysisIn a speech at a national bush summit in Dubbo, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was concerned about the disconnect between the city and bush and the rise in organised farm invasions. He said he wanted to reconnect Australians with rural and regional communities and ensure there was an “appropriate balance” in what students were taught about farming. AAP FactCheck examined the claim made by the Prime Minister that 75 per cent of grade six students believed cotton came from animals and 45 per cent couldn’t identify bananas, bread and cheese as farm produce.A spokesperson for Mr Morrison told AAP FactCheck the source of his claim was a 2011 report titled Food, Fibre and the Future commissioned by the Primary Industries Education Foundation, a not-for-profit advocacy body funded by a number of large Australian agricultural producers including Cotton Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia. The Food, Fibre and the Future report surveyed grade six and grade 10 students and teachers, to find out what they knew about primary industries in Australia.Seventy-one schools participated in the survey, including 35 primary schools. No primary schools in the Northern Territory or the ACT took part.The report does not name the schools which participated, nor how many were in regional or rural areas.Year-six students, the group quoted by the Prime Minister, performed the worst in the survey. The report found 75 per cent of the grade six students surveyed believed cotton socks were made from an animal product. This supports the first half of Mr Morrison’s claim. However, Mr Morrison’s representation of the report’s findings on bananas, cheese and bread is misleading.The survey showed students a picture of a lunchbox containing a cheese sandwich and banana, accompanied by a question asking which foods in the lunchbox come from farms.The answer options were: just the banana, just the banana and the cheese, just the bread and the banana, all of them.The report found only 55 per cent of grade six students identified all three items as collectively coming from farms, meaning 45 per cent could not correctly identify the source of all three.However, according to the report, an additional 24-79 per cent correctly identified both the banana and cheese as coming from a farm. The report found students had the hardest time linking bread with farming.According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS] Sample Size Calculator, the report’s sample size was too small to reach “the required level of accuracy”.If the report sought a confidence level of 95 per cent – meaning if the survey was repeated there would be a 95 per cent chance the results would be repeated – the calculator found it would need a sample size of at least 384 students to be accurate. With a confidence level of 99 per cent, the calculator showed a sample size of 662 would be needed. The number of grade six students surveyed was 213 – or 0.077 per cent of the total number of grade six students of 276,038 according to ABS data in 2011 when the survey was undertaken. As the sample size of the survey was too small, the report was eight years old, and the results were misrepresented slightly by the Prime Minister, AAP FactCheck found Mr Morrison’s claim to be true but misleading.","https://www.pm.gov.au/media/address-daily-telegraph-bush-summit,https://www.piefa.edu.au/,https://www.piefa.edu.au/uploads/9/8/9/8/98986708/food_fibre_and_future_pief_report.pdf,https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Sample+Size+Calculator?opendocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4221.02018?OpenDocument","Do 45 per cent of year six students not know where bananas, cheese and bread come from?",,,,,,

His party scored 0.2 per cent of the vote in Victoria and failed to win a seat.A report on a Swiss football brawl, including eyewitness video, was published by Tages-Anzeiger, a Swiss German-language national daily newspaper on May 20, 2018.AAP FactCheck found the video posted on Facebook was a segment of a longer 2min 55sec video originally published on May 20, 2018 as part of a news story by Swiss German-language media platform Blick, which states it’s “the Swiss portal for news in the fields of news, politics, business, sports, people, entertainment, lifestyle and cars”. The translated Blick story headline reads: “Shock video shows wild brawl after FCB match. Football chasers rage in Basel’s residential district”.The Blick story states the brawl broke out on Saturday night May 19, 2018 in Birsstrasse, Basel, after a football match between FC Luzern and FC Basel, between the stadium and the Redingstrasse. “It all began when 30 ‘fans’ in white protective suits painted a bridge pier on Birsstrasse. Meanwhile, according to prosecutors 60 more people appeared and it came to a brawl,” the Blick report states.Another report about the same brawl and including the same eyewitness video was published by Tages-Anzeiger, a Swiss German-language national daily newspaper in Zurich, Switzerland, also on May 20, 2018 with the translated headline: “Around 90 people beat and riot after FCB match in Basel. After the championship match between Basel and Lucerne, violent clashes took place. The police arrested two Germans.” A third report also dated May 20, 2018 using a 1min 33sec version of the video was published by another Swiss media platform tio.ch under the headline “Clashes after Basel-Lucerne: the video of the violence. After a busy match last night: in addition to the scuffles, various acts of vandalism were also carried out and at least two people were injured.”On May 22, 2018 the Basel city prosecutor issued a “witness call” seeking further information and any images relating to “violent clashes between several dozen violent football fans on the evening May 19, 2018 after the football match FC Basel against FC Luzern, in the vicinity of the stadium St. Jakob Park”.  The prosecutor’s release was headlined “First arrests after violent clashes” and said six people had been arrested on suspicion of “assault, trafficking and property damage”.Less than two weeks after the Basel football brawl, the eyewitness video was repurposed as a video depicting Muslims rioting in the UK during Ramadan.The fake video was immediately debunked on June 1, 2018 by Maldita, an independent journalistic platform in Spain which states it focuses on the control of disinformation and public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques.  The platform’s name translates as “the damned” The Maldita headline about the “hoax” states: “The video of riots of Muslims for Ramadan in London is not real: it is a fight between ultras in Switzerland”. The report also says: “The hoax is spreading to more countries.”The fake video has since been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook and other social media and played over one million times despite being debunked as a fake by a number of fact check units.The fake video was posted on Facebook in Sri Lanka twice on June 2, 2019, here and here, again in Australia also on June 2 and in Canada on June 4. The fake Facebook video posts have also been debunked by the India’s Boom fact check team on June 4, 2019.

The post reads in part: “Bees can become tired and they simply don’t have enough energy to return to the hive which can often result in being swept away.

It has also shared on the viral news site UNILAD, which superimposed excerpts of the post on a video of bees and Sir David, and on other Facebook pages.  The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found Sir David Attenborough does not have any verified social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. The BBC confirmed in 2018 the post did not come from the 93-year-old naturalist and requested it be removed from Facebook after people in the United Kingdom started leaving out spoonfuls of sugar water to feed “tired bees”.Apiarists recommend planting more flowers gives bees a better chance at survival.NSW Apiarists’ Association president Stephen Targett told AAP FactCheck feeding bees sugar water was only a “short-term solution” used by experienced beekeepers in exceptional circumstances such as drought. Mr Targett said feeding sugar water to bees long term could contaminate the hive with disease and kill the colony. He said a long-term solution to keeping bee colonies alive was to plant flowers closer to bee populations for the bees to pollinate.","https://www.facebook.com/1085017588336090/photos/a.1085023761668806/1091704247667424/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/uniladmag/videos/5012163522140000/?v=5012163522140000,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/13/bbc-forces-facebook-remove-fake-news-claimed-sir-david-attenborough/,https://www.nswaa.com.au/contact-us",Feeding sugar water to bees will kill them,,,,,,

His Facebook page has over 3500 likes.The AnalysisThe quote has been shared widely on social media, including by Academy award-winning Australian actress Nicole Kidman, whose Facebook page has over 10.5 million likes. She shared the same quote to mark Martin Luther King Day in January, 2019. That post received over 4,200 reactions and was shared over 430 times. The quote has also been been included in a number of high profile speeches. Former US president Bill Clinton credited the line to Dr King in a speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner in 2000. More recently, Republican Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick included the quote in a 2017 speech, advocating for laws targeting transgender people access to bathrooms.Nicole Kidman is one of a number of famous people who have shared the quote.According to fact checking units Snopes and Politifact, the quote does not appear anywhere in Dr King’s speeches or writings. In 2017, Politifact interviewed Clayborne Carson, the Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial professor of history at Stanford University and director of a research institute in King’s name. He said it’s “easier to prove what King said on a particular occasion than to prove that he never said the quote in question on any occasion.” The quote resembles a line from a sermon Dr King delivered in Selma, Alabama on March 8, 1965, the day after Bloody Sunday, when civil rights protesters were attacked by police in the same city. In his sermon Dr King said, “A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.”","https://www.facebook.com/DavePellowe/photos/a.1359029634254181/1359030694254075/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/DavePellowe/?tn-str=k*F,https://www.facebook.com/NicoleKidmanOfficial/photos/a.10152370666341128/10155053652921128/?type=3&theater,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1dLGaeRX6f8C&pg=PA799&dq=our+lives+begin+to+end+the+day+we+become+silent+on+things+that+matter&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=our%20lives%20begin%20to%20end%20the%20day%20we%20become%20silent%20on%20things%20that%20matter&f=false,https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/jan/06/dan-patrick/half-true-dan-patrick-martin-luther-king-saying-li/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mlk-our-lives-begin-to-end/,https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/jan/06/dan-patrick/half-true-dan-patrick-martin-luther-king-saying-li/,https://www.history.com/news/selmas-bloody-sunday-50-years-ago,https://books.google.com.au/books?id=y2mVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false",No proof quote was made by Martin Luther King Jr,,,,,,

It has also been tweeted by British comedian Ricky Gervais. The AnalysisAAP FactCheck examined the image and found it dated back to at least October 16, 2011 where it appeared on the photo sharing site Imgur.  The source of the Imgur post links it to the same photo uploaded on Reddit by user u/BeefPieSoup on the same day. The dingo and dead shark image was also used in an article on Australian dingoes published in Russian on Storia website six years ago. The site was registered with a domain from Montenegro.The top image, showing a dingo and a dead shark, has been shared widely since 2011 while the lower half was posted as a seperate image in 2012.The bottom half of the photo shows two copperhead snakes mating by the side of the road. A University of Melbourne information page lists three species of on copperhead snakes in Australia – pygmy, highlands and lowlands. They are described as a cool climate snake and can be found near water in Victoria, Tasmania and parts of NSW and South Australia. Copperhead snakes are venomous and feed almost exclusively on lizards, frogs and occasionally on reptile eggs.AAP FactCheck traced the photo of the copperhead snakes to an Imgur post on February 9, 2012 with the title, “Took a rare photo of 2 Copperhead Snakes in Australia”. The photo’s source is linked to a Reddit thread posted by u/pretty-little-angel on the same date.","https://www.facebook.com/madeinpoortaste/photos/a.337613596693045/471956563258747/?type=3&theater,https://www.instagram.com/madeinpoortaste/?hl=en,https://www.facebook.com/FishingAroundWesternAustralia/posts/779322778934888,https://www.facebook.com/tom.miranda.370/posts/1906600669645718,https://www.facebook.com/brianmitchellforlyons/posts/1816493945077685,https://twitter.com/rickygervais/status/990147539902005249?lang=en,https://imgur.com/gallery/2B4cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ldzt8/a_wild_dingo_eating_a_shark_welcome_to_australia/,https://storia.me/ru/1452170-1frulc/s,https://storia.me/,https://biomedicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/departments/pharmacology/engage/avru/discover/snakes/copperhead-austrelaps-superbus,https://imgur.com/gallery/xdXnH/comment/2342760,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/phfm7/took_a_rare_photo_of_2_copperhead_snakes_in/",Dingo and shark on the beach with mating snakes pic is fake,,,,,,
398,,,,False,,2019-07-12,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/venomous-snake-diagram-claims-are-false/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck examined a Facebook post by Prepper Discounters on May 13, 2014 of a diagram claiming to show how to identify “poisonous” snakes. This Facebook post from May 13, 2014 claims to show how to identify “poisonous” and “non-poisonous” snakes.The drawn diagram shows the head and underside of a tail of two snakes. With arrows pointing to each characteristic, the diagram claims elliptical pupils, thermal sensing pits and a single row of scales on the underside of a snake indicate it is “poisonous”. The second diagram claims round pupils, no thermal sensing pits and two rows of scales on the underside of a snake show it is “non-poisonous”. At the time of publication, the post had been shared 49,000 times, and attracted more than 540 comments and 1500 reactions. Prepper Discounters are an online store “providing basic essentials to maintain a normal lifestyle in the event of anything that disrupts our daily routine” based in Columbus, Ohio.The AnalysisPupils and pits on snakes both serve practical purposes unrelated to whether or not a snake is venomous. Elliptical pupils tend to be a trait of nocturnal snakes, while snakes active during the day have round pupils, according to an article on identifying venomous snakes published by McGill University in Canada. The pits on a snake’s head are thermal sensors used to help find prey and regulate body temperature. While venomous “pit vipers” found in the US have these sensors, so do pythons, which are constrictors and not venomous.Snake catcher Rhys Chapman says the Eastern Brown snake and Coastal Carpet Python are proof the diagram is incorrect.The United States only has four types of venomous snakes. Three of those – rattlesnakes, copperheads and cottonmouths, also known as water moccasins – fit the diagram. However, the coral snake has round pupils and no thermal sensing pits.Rhys Chapman, a snake catcher in Australia – home to many of the most venomous snakes in the world – told AAP FactCheck the diagram was not relevant outside a “specific region in the USA” and urged Facebook users not to be fooled. “The diagram is completely incorrect and not valid here in Australia, for starters snakes are venomous not poisonous,” he told AAP FactCheck.Mr Chapman also provided AAP FactCheck with a photo proving the diagram wrong (pictured above). The photo shows a highly venomous Eastern Brown snake, which had round pupils and no thermal sensing pits, qualities the diagram claims make it non-venomous. It also shows a non-venomous coastal carpet python which has the physical characteristics the diagram claims are features of venomous snakes.Richie Gilbert, a snake catcher from Queensland with over 80,000 likes on Facebook also debunked the image in 2015, around the time the picture first began to gain prominence. He implored users not to share it. “It seems this image was based on snakes for the USA although I’m not sure if it’s even reliable for over there,” he wrote. “There is no one single rule that can help distinguish between venomous and non-venomous here in Australia.”","https://www.facebook.com/PrepperDiscounters/photos/a.408327609198169/757138704317056/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/PrepperDiscounters/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/did-you-know-general-science/fake-snake-news-how-not-identify-poisonous-snake,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/default.html,https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/03/08/venomous-snakes-australia_n_9413542.html,https://sunshinecoastsnakecatchers24-7.com.au/about-us/,https://www.facebook.com/SunshineCoastSnakeCatchers/posts/1629171410667981",Venomous snake diagram claims are false,,,,,,

July 8, 2019.The AnalysisHobart Lord Mayor Anna Reynolds said low incomes and a lack of affordable housing have created “perfect storm” conditions driving the national housing and homelessness crisis. Ms Reynolds leads a coalition of lord mayors which has identified this as a key priority and is pressuring the federal government to help resolve the issue by investing more in social housing that has remained flat for 20 years. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Reynolds’ claim that a quarter of Tasmanians, or 120,000 people, live in poverty.Homelessness and the lack of social housing was cast into the national spotlight by Independent Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie, who demanded federal relief for Tasmania public housing debt in exchange for supporting the government’s $158 billion tax cut package in parliament.Lord Mayors from around the nation put assistant federal Minister for Homelessness and Housing Luke Howarth “on notice” about the gravity of the issue at the 2019 Asia Pacific Cities Summit in Brisbane. Ms Reynolds, whose city is struggling under the weight of a population boom and rising property prices, said lord mayors were better placed than state and federal counterparts to see the extent of the issue. The Poverty in Australia 2018 report by Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) and the University of New South Wales states poverty exists when “a household’s disposable (after-tax) income falls below a level considered inadequate to achieve an acceptable standard of living”.For its calculations, the 2018 poverty report used 2015-16 data and the “international poverty line”, a benchmark used in national and international poverty studies including in the European Union. Commonly poverty line thresholds are set at either 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the median disposable household income. “The poverty lines aim to measure living standards relative to those enjoyed by ‘middle Australia’,” the report said. The 60 per cent poverty line, before housing costs, for a single adult in Australia is $519 a week. For a couple with two children, it is $1,090 a week.According to the poverty report, 23.6 per cent – or about 120,000 – of Tasmanians live on 60 per cent of Australia’s median disposable household income, or in other words live in poverty. This is the second highest percentage in Australia behind South Australia which has 24.2 per cent. The national ranking from worst to best is South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland equal on 21.4 per cent, Victoria 21 per cent, Northern Territory 16.6 and ACT 11.9. Nationally the figure is 18.6 per cent.Based on these figures, AAP FactCheck found Ms Reynolds claim to be true, accounting for the fact she rounded the percentage of Tasmanians in poverty from 23.6 per cent up to one quarter.The 2018 poverty report uses 2015-16 data. According to the Australia Bureau of Statistics [ABS],  Tasmania’s population in 2015 was 515,694. One quarter of the 2015 population is 129,000.The 2016 Census data puts Tasmania’s population at 509,965, a quarter of which is 127,500. You have to go back to 2003-2005 ABS data to find a population figure of 480,000 for Tasmania to match Ms Reynolds claim of 120,000 equaling one quarter. The latest ABS data estimates Tasmania’s population increased to 531,529 by the December quarter 2018. Based on these figures, AAP FactCheck found Ms Reynolds claim that 120,000 Tasmanians live below the poverty line, is false. The true figure was higher by 7500-9000 people.","https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/lord-mayor-of-hobart-anna-reynolds-on-housing-crisis/11286972,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/03/jacqui-lambie-demands-tasmanian-debt-relief-in-exchange-for-tax-cut-support,https://www.smh.com.au/national/lord-mayors-put-howarth-on-notice-over-homelessness-issue-20190710-p525y3.html,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328718886_European_Union_Definition_of_Poverty,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ACOSS_Poverty-in-Australia-Report_Web-Final.pdf,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ACOSS_Poverty-in-Australia-Report_Web-Final.pdf,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ACOSS_Poverty-in-Australia-Report_Web-Final.pdf,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument,https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/6?opendocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument,https://www.treasury.tas.gov.au/Documents/Population.pdf","Do a quarter of Tasmanians – or 120,000 people – live below the poverty line?",,,,,,

Press the ‘cancel’ button twice before inserting the card. If anyone has set-up the key pad to steal yr (sic) PIN code, this will cancel that set-up. Please make it a habit and part of every transaction that you make. Please share with Family & Friends whom you care.” CIRnow-Australia’s Facebook page has more than 2770 followers. It states: “We the People are entitled through our Constitution Section 128 to have a say in how we are governed by voting in referendums.” The group’s website describes its mission as helping to “educate Australians and indeed patriots around the world learn the truth about the political party crimes and treason being committed against us every day”. The AnalysisThe same ATM tip has been posted on social media since at least November 2018 and been shared in various forms in the US, Canada, Africa, Asia and more recently Australia. Here’s three examples from the Philippines, South Africa and India.Despite being investigated by up to 10 fact checking services which found it to be false, the tip is still being shared. UK group ThatsNonsense.com debunked the tip in November 2018, concluding it could not “find any examples where pressing the cancel button twice on the keypad would prevent any such scams. As such we rank the message false”. David Tente, executive director of the ATM Industry Association, told the Snopes US fact-checking website the claim was “completely false”. Mr Tente said a cancel command from the keypad “would not have any impact on the transaction, except to cancel it”.Dr Vassil Roussev, computer science professor at the University of New Orleans and the director of the UNO Cyber Center, told Politifact the message “should not, in any way, be taken as a safety precaution. It won’t hurt you, but I would place zero value on this type of advice.”In January 2019, AFP debunked a similar tip in India which featured “Important message from RBI”. A Reserve Bank of India spokesman denied the bank had issued any such warning. “This news is false,” he told AFP.In Africa, the PesaCheck fact check unit warned about the message circulating in Kenya and declared it was false. Another fact checking unit, Africa Check concluded the ‘tip’ was “useless”. “The ‘cancel’ button on the ATM has the sole job of interrupting the transaction, to abort the transaction in the event it is being transmitted to the bank for authorisation,” Fidelis Muia, director of technical services at theKenya Bankers Association, told Africa Check. “The ‘cancel’ button has no effect on the PIN entry mechanism and pressing it will in no way affect the PIN or its entry.”  Curt Binns, Canada’s executive director of the ATM Industry Association, a non-profit association that represents the ATM industry globally said the message “doesn’t make any sense” and was unnecessary.A Commonwealth Bank spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the claims made by the post were false and encouraged customers “to look out and remain vigilant when using an ATM”. Andy White, CEO of Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet),  a payments industry body, told AAP FactCheck: “This message is not accurate.  Pressing cancel will not deactivate any bug in an ATM PIN pad.”","https://www.facebook.com/cirnowaustralia/photos/a.573952192969639/869828340048688/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/pg/cirnowaustralia/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.cirnow.com.au/cirnow-history/,https://www.facebook.com/LolasTours/photos/a.945014922251023/1946787828740389/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/topsecurar/photos/a.873880112648623/1969597156410241/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/thehindradio/photos/a.1097929843676420/1533554900113910/?type=3&theater,https://www.thatsnonsense.com/does-pressing-cancel-twice-on-atm-stop-pin-from-being-stolen-fact-check/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/atm-press-cancel-pin/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jan/22/facebook-posts/does-pressing-cancel-twice-atm-protect-your-pin-be/,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-reserve-bank-india-did-not-tell-people-press-cancel-twice-atms,https://pesacheck.org/false-double-pressing-the-cancel-button-on-an-atm-is-not-a-valid-security-measure-66a707e3b7b7?fbclid=IwAR0uiDkDxgJkB7vBqDCrga5WN5u6I3skgFm1vnyIQ5C_-22s--cypsfLtkU,https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-pressing-cancel-twice-on-an-atm-doesnt-protect-your-pin/,https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/22/19/fact-check-no-pressing-cancel-twice-at-an-atm-does-not-protect-against-fraud",ATM “tip” to protect your PIN is false,,,,,,

Two of the images were taken five years apart.The main photograph of Jim Morrison sitting alone on a couch can be purchased online from a Los Angeles furnishings and fashion site which is selling it as part of a collection of six vintage Morrison images for $US1,800. The site attributes the image to 1967 by Gloria Stavers, a former editor of teen fan publication 16 Magazine and states it comes from the private collection of American music manager Danny Fields. The three separate images are the original photos which were photo-shopped together to create the image above.The Bruce Lee solo photo was taken at Ocean Terminal, the Hong Kong cruise terminal and shopping centre, as part of a publicity shoot. The Bruce Lee Family Company confirmed to AFP Fact Check the image was taken after a press conference in 1972. The Jimi Hendrix image has part of his head and left arm missing, so as to imply he’s taking a “selfie” of the three men on the couch.

They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what is happening.” The quote appears on an image of three women looking down at their mobile phones.At the time of publication, the post had been shared more than 160 times and had attracted over 110 reactions.One Eyed Hawk states it is “committed to educating ourselves and others by sharing insightful, inspiring news/media articles that support people, the environment, spiritual growth and development”. The AnalysisAAP FactCheck found the word “revolt” appeared  six times in the novel 1984, and the quote in the Facebook post, does not appear in this exact or similar form.The statement most similar to the quote on Facebook in 1984 is: “The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed.”UK entertainment company Hot Ticket Offers tweeted the quote from the stage play 1984 on August 2, 2014 as an incentive to buy tickets.The Facebook quote comes from a 2013 stage adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984 book. Corey McMahon is the associate director of the 1984 stage production in Australia, which toured in 2017. Mr McMahon said the production encouraged audiences to look at the world differently and to see what they were missing while they were busy using social media.

July 9, 2019.The AnalysisLord mayors across Australia are pressuring the federal government to tackle the homelessness crisis and are meeting the Assistant Minister for Community Housing and Homelessness Luke Howarth for a two-day summit in Brisbane to focus on the issue.Ahead of the meeting Mr Howarth said “it is important to put a positive spin” on homelessness. Prime Minister Scott Morrison created the homelessness portfolio after the May election. AAP FactCheck examined Mr Howarth’s claim made on ABC RN (Radio National) Breakfast that homelessness was growing at a slower rate than Australia’s population.Mr Howarth’s office told AAP FactCheck the source of his claim was Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data, but didn’t clarify which census period he was using to support his claim.The first Australian census was conducted in 1911, and it has been held every five years since 1961.According to the two most recent censuses of 2011 and 2016, the number of homeless people living in Australia grew by 13,988 or 13.65 per cent in 2011-16, from 102,439 to 116,427. In the same period, the Australian population grew by 1,850,883 or 8.29 per cent, from 22,340,024 to 24,190,907. AAP FactCheck asked Mr Howarth’s office to clarify what “census period” he was referring to.In a written response Mr Howarth’s office told AAP FactCheck he used a different metric – the rate of homelessness – to justify the claim on RN Breakfast. “The rate of homelessness in Australia in the last ABS data shows that in 2016 it’s actually 2 per cent lower than it was in 2001, and this is a reflection of the good work that organisations and government has been doing in this space, but there’s more to be done,” Mr Howarth’s office said.The rate of homelessness is the proportion of the homeless population to the general population, not the number of homeless people as Mr Howarth claimed.During his RN Breakfast interview, Mr Howarth referred to three census periods 2001-06, 2006-11 and 2011-16. Looking at these three census periods, the number of homeless people grew by 21,113 or 22.15 per cent from 95,314 to 116,427. The Australian population grew by 4,916,206 or 25.51 per cent, from 19,274,701 to 24,190,907, between 2001 and 2016. Based on these three census periods, Mr Howarth’s claim that the number of homeless people in Australia grew at a slower pace than the population is true.But it is also misleading because using 2001-2016 figures hides the spike in the number of homeless people revealed in the last 2011-16 census period. The number of homeless people living in Australia grew by 13,988 or 13.65 per cent in 2011-16, from 102,439 to 116,427. In the same period, the Australian population grew by 8.29 per cent. Based on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr Howarth’s claim to be true but misleading.","https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/assistant-homelessness-minister-luke-howarth-on-housing/11290742,https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/CO-57?opendocument&navpos=620,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2049.02016?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument,https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/assistant-homelessness-minister-luke-howarth-on-housing/11290742,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2049.02016?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument,https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocument",Has the increase in the number of homeless people been lower than population growth?,,,,,,

The AnalysisUS President Donald Trump used the same quote in a April 16, 2015 tweet which attracted 346 retweets and 361 likes.  It was also used by his daughter Ivanka Trump in her 2017 book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success. US President Donald Trump tweeted the same false quote on April 16, 2015.Fact checking website Quote Investigator probed the quote’s origins in 2011 and found “no evidence that John Quincy Adams spoke or wrote the words”. The website traced the earliest version of the quote to a 1997 book titled, The Most Important Things I Know. The book attributes US country singer Dolly Parton with the following similar remark: “If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then you are an excellent leader”. Quote Investigator also listed two other similar versions of the quote: A 1939 comment from a church pastor in a Missouri newspaper read: “Whereupon, let us learn more, care more, love more and possibly do more in making a better world and our own community a more enjoyable place in which to live”;NFL star Peyton Manning in a 1998 acceptance speech: “If my actions on the field and having my name on this Sullivan Trophy inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, as so many have said, I only hope they don’t limit that potential to sports.” Quote Investigator found the earliest example of former President Adams being credited with the quote was in a 2002 business book, The Paradox of Power: A Transforming View of Leadership. The passage read: “You must lead and motivate from the middle. The motivator in the middle is the motivator who truly inspires people to do and be their best, John Quincy Adams challenged all managers when he wrote, “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader”.The quote was also debunked in 2017 by H. W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas and the editor in chief of The Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Mr Brands said he had “never seen that from J. Q. Adams. It doesn’t sound like him. He wasn’t the dreamy type”.Sara Martin, also of The Adams Papers from the Massachusetts Historical Society, agreed the quote “neither sounds like him, nor is it really the vein of political thought that he typically expresses in his quotations”.","https://www.facebook.com/pinnaclehpc/photos/a.300927946672036/2164176660347146/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/588733168339017728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E588733168339017728&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politifact.com%2Ftruth-o-meter%2Fstatements%2F2017%2Fmay%2F05%2Fivanka-trump%2Fbook-john-quincy-adams-quote%2F,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/03/inspire-dream-leader/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/",Leadership quote credited to former US president John Quincy Adams is false,,,,,,

He has been a member of the Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and a health policy officer at the Australian Consumers’ Association (Choice). Mr Goddard’s State of Health 2018 report found Tasmania’s population was older and poorer than any other state with the lowest level of income and wealth. The average age of people in Hobart in 2016 was 39.7 years, higher than any other capital. Life expectancy for men in Tasmania was 78.8 and 82.9 for women compared to the national average of 80.4 and 84.6 respectively. Median weekly income and average household assets were substantially below any other state, the report found. Mr Goddard’s report also detailed per capita state government day-to-day health expenditure for 2014-15 to 2016-17 and examined Commonwealth activity-based funding. Per capita expenditure for that period was 15.2 per cent lower in Tasmania than in Australia as a whole and capital investment was 38.4 per cent lower.The report lists how the Commonwealth Grants Commission administers GST funding in the two stages – redistribution to the states for an equal per capita amount and the needs of each state’s population. It determined how much health-related GST was being diverted from health into other government priorities by adding these two figures together.The report concluded the Hodgman Liberal government, which came to power in March 2014, had “underfunded the state’s health system by around $1.6 billion since being elected, compared with the amount the Commonwealth Grants Commission has calculated needs to be spent to give Tasmanians the same standard and level of care as other Australians”. The Commonwealth Grants Commission does not have a view on how a state should spend GST revenue, and spending is in accordance with each state’s own priorities.AAP FactCheck concludes Mr Wilkie correctly referenced the Goddard report in stating that $1.6 billion in health-related GST funding has been diverted by the Tasmanian government since 2014.Mr Wilkie’s description of this as a “long-running fraud on both the Commonwealth and the people of Tasmania” is purely his opinion, as there is no compulsion on the Tasmanian government to spend GST funding on specific services.AAP FactCheck contacted Tasmania’s new health minister Sarah Courtney regarding her department’s rejection of Mr Wilkie’s claim but received no reply by the time of original publication. A later reply claimed Tasmania’s health budget is “up from 25 per cent of total spending to 32 per cent in a decade” but it did not address Mr Wilkie’s claim in reference to the Goddard report.Former health minister Michael Ferguson was replaced in a reshuffle on June 30 by Ms Courtney. Mr Ferguson had suffered a series of no-confidence and censure motions in the parliament over his handling of the health portfolio and criticism from wider health sector.","https://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/independent-mp-andrew-wilkie-asks-federal-government-to-intervene-in-tasmanias-health-crisis/news-story/45a912b8d09480f2723270b80b0a90d6https://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/independent-mp-andrew-wilkie-asks-federal-government-to-intervene-in-tasmanias-health-crisis/news-story/45a912b8d09480f2723270b80b0a90d6,https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=f671120b-b891-476d-9e9e-ab81e8f233e7&subId=301154,http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/Council/Submissions/HST/HST%2010%20Addendum%20Martyn%20Goddard%20State%20of%20Health%202018.pdf,http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/Council/Submissions/HST/HST%2010%20Addendum%20Martyn%20Goddard%20State%20of%20Health%202018.pdf,https://www.themercury.com.au/news/opinion/good-luck-to-new-minister/news-story/f3e6697e555f07d18631c4dcd0bf8f78",Has the Tasmanian government diverted $1.6 billion in GST funding away from its health sector since 2014?,,,,,,

The screenshot shows Muhammad as the number one-ranked name followed by Noah, George, Oliver and Charlie.The Facebook post from June 26 2019, claimed to show a list of the top boys names in Australia as aired on Channel Nine’s Today Extra program.The image was posted by a member of Common Cause Australia, a public group that supports “all Australian patriot political parties”, and advocates for “no Halal – no sharia law – no burqa” and  to “Make Australia Great Again”.At the time this article was published, the post had attracted 478 shares, 33 comments and 85 reactions. Accompanying the screenshot is the caption: “Just announced on Channel 9 the TOP 5 Baby Boy names in Australia for 2019. I took this photo myself this morning off the tv. I did not fake or change it.”The AnalysisThe post links to the Facebook page of Common Cause Australia, where they outline their anti-Islamic agenda, including their wish to “Ban the Koran. STOP ALL islamic immigration to OZ … Rid OZ of all Mosques.”The Today Extra program confirmed in a statement to AAP FactCheck that it ran a “quick read” segment on June 26, 2019 referencing a June 25 story from the website of UK newspaper The Sun, titled ‘Name Game Most popular baby names of 2019 so far revealed’. The BBC investigated whether Muhammad was a popular baby name due to up to 12 variations in spellings.The story cited the website BabyCentre which analysed the most popular UK baby names for 2019 so far, listing Muhammed as the most popular choice for boys. BabyCentre’s list of names was compiled using parent registrations on its UK website.In 2017, Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) ranked Muhammad as the 10th most popular name for boys in England and Wales. The most popular name was Oliver. Figures for 2018 are due to be released later this year.A 2014 story titled ‘Is Muhammad the most popular boy’s name in Britain?’ The Guardian examined the difference between the ONS count and the methodology used by BabyCentre.BabyCentre said its rankings “combine names that sound the same but have different spellings, giving a measure of baby name popularity. We have found, in the past, that this is a good indicator of the ONS statistics that are released the following year”.The BBC also examined the issue in a 2018 story titled ‘Baby names: Is Muhammad the most popular?’It looked at whether Muhammad was a popular baby name due to the up to 12 variations in spelling for that name, includinng Mohammad, Muhamed, Mohamud, Mohummad, Mohummed, Mouhamed, Mohammod and Mouhamad. The ONS said it treated each spelling separately and ranked each according to how many times an individual spelling appeared on a birth certificate. Australian Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry statistics and government data on the most popular baby names in 2018 show Muhammad (only spelling) ranked 44th in both NSW and Victoria. No spelling of the name was listed in the top 100 names for Queensland and South Australia, it was not in the top 50 in Western Australia, the top 20 for Northern Territory nor the top 10 for Tasmania and the ACT.Baby Names Australia 2019, published by social research group McCrindle, found the name Muhammad was ranked 73rd in 2018 with 343 occurrences. No other spelling variations were listed. The five top boys names on this list, in order, were Oliver, Jack, William, Noah and Henry.The June 26, 2019 Facebook post by Common Cause Australia claimed the 2019 top five Australian list was in order Muhammad, Noah, George, Oliver and Charlie.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205748139739696&set=gm.1200096030163086&type=3&theater&ifg=1,https://www.facebook.com/groups/464081490431214/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/464081490431214/about/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/9372946/most-popular-baby-names-2019-so-far-revealed-eighties-classics/,https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a25034284/top-baby-names-for-2019---so-far,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2017#things-you-need-to-know-about-this-release,https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/01/muhammad-not-most-popular-boys-name-in-britain,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45638806,https://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Documents/stats-names-2010s.pdf,https://www.bdm.vic.gov.au/births/naming-your-child/popular-victorian-baby-names/popular-baby-names-in-victoria-2018,https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/top-100-baby-names,https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/popular-baby-names/resource/f253dbfa-2316-4506-95ee-1c1e1627663a,https://bdm.justice.wa.gov.au/_apps/BabyNames/Default.aspx,https://nt.gov.au/law/bdm/popular-baby-names,https://www.justice.tas.gov.au/bdm/top_baby_names#Top%20Baby%20Names%20for%202018,https://www.act.gov.au/our-canberra/latest-news/2018/december/canberras-most-popular-baby-names-2018,https://2qean3b1jjd1s87812ool5ji-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019BabyNamesAustralia_Report_McCrindle_May2019.pdf",Muhammad is not Australia’s No1 baby boy name,,,,,,

The caption on the post reads: “Thousands of people in Australia cancel their Netflix subscriptions because of this new free service”. The post had been shared more than 1000 times.The AnalysisThe Facebook post links to a website page called Au News featuring a June 28, 2019 Movieflix news story and the headline “There is a better service than Netflix … and it’s free for the Australians!”, by Tim Brooks.The story claims Netflix lost thousands of Australian users because a new and identical MovieFlix service was offering free lifetime subscriptions to people living in Australia. It said the first 5000 people who signed up for MovieFlix would get the service for free, and warned the limit had almost been reached and the offer would end soon. There are more than 10 comments under the story celebrating the MovieFlix offer and encouraging others to sign up. Even the names in the comments section click through to the MovieFlix sign up page requesting an email, name, address and credit card details.The Consumer Protection tweet warning the MovieFlix Facebook post on May 24, 2019 is a phishing scam designed to steal credit card details. Every other tab on the Au News page clicks through to the same MovieFlix sign up page requesting an email, name, address and credit card details. The Politics, Sport, Science tabs are not active and all click through to this sign up page.  Netflix told AAP FactCheck it did not know anything specific about the MovieFlix post. “Unfortunately, scams are common on the internet and target popular brands such as Netflix and other companies with large customer bases to lure users into giving out personal information,” Netflix said.Western Australia’s Consumer Protection, a division of the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, tweeted a warning about the MovieFlix Facebook post on May 24, 2019, together with a screen shot of the post. “Beware an ad on Facebook that claims to be promoting ‘MovieFlix’ but is a phishing scam designed to steal credit card details. If you provided yours, watch your accounts or cancel cards,” @ConsumerWA said in its tweet. Scamwatch, which is run by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), retweeted Consumer Protection WA’s post on May 27, 2019. Scamwatch states its role is to provide information to consumers and small businesses about how to recognise, avoid and report scams.The ACCC told AAP FactCheck it had received a number of reports about the MovieFlix story and  “all reports state that a Facebook advertisement was how they came in contact with the service”. Several people reported providing personal information including their credit or debit card details, the ACCC said.AAP FactCheck found the same and similar MovieFlix news stories on multiple internet sites in English and other languages and targeting other countries including Austria, Canada, “Nordic countries”, the UK, USA and Ireland.

At the time of publishing this article, the post had been shared more than 138 times and had attracted more than 150 comments and 280 reactions.In the alleged transcript, Sales queries the wisdom of teaching the boy scouts to shoot.“Leigh Sales: Shooting! That’s a bit irresponsible, isn’t it?General Cosgrove: I don’t see why, they’ll be properly supervised on the rifle range.Leigh Sales: Don’t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?General Cosgrove: I don’t see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.Leigh Sales: But you’re equipping them to become violent killers.General Cosgrove: Well, Ma’am, you’re equipped to be a prostitute, but you’re not one, are you?”The AnalysisThe script in this Facebook post has been circulating the internet in various forms since 1997 and has been attributed to a number of different people over the years.In 1997, the “prostitute” comment was attributed to a youth club leader called Jones who was allegedly being interviewed on a Welsh regional radio station. The Welsh text is almost identical to the June 2019 Facebook post. 2GB radio broadcaster Alan Jones admitted he was caught out by the hoax after reading the fake transcript on air in 2008. In 1999 and 2001, the controversial remark was Americanised and attributed to a Lieutenant General Reinwald, who was said to have been interviewed on US radio network NPR. According to the fact checking unit Snopes in this September 2000 article titled ‘Teaching Boy Scout to Shoot’, the US Army denied the existence of a Lt Gen Reinwald and said the transcript was a hoax. An NPR spokesperson also told Snopes “the story is false – the dialogue mentioned was not an NPR interview, and it never aired on any NPR program.” An Australian version of the transcript emerged in 2008 when a listener sent it to 2GB radio broadcaster Alan Jones. Framing it as an ABC radio interview with “Major General Peter Cosgrove”, Jones read the transcript on air, saying it included the best put-down in “a million years”.  Jones admitted a few minutes later one of his producers had advised him he’d “been caught again” by a fake. The transcript, which Jones said he’d read out in good faith, was an “urban myth”. He urged his listeners to check material before sending it to him. “It was quite a good line nonetheless, no matter who said it,” Jones said on air after admitting his error.The ABC TV program Media Watch highlighted the incident in a segment aired in May 2008.The transcript went viral in 2013 on Facebook when it was again attributed to “General Cosgrove” and an ABC interviewer, according to a report in The Australian newspaper. At that time, the fake transcript had been shared more than 18,000 times.The former defence chief told The Australian getting rid of the hoax was like “catching smoke” and it was “a sad reality of the information age”. “It is almost like a tennis ball rocketing around the place,” he said. “You think it’s had its go and when anybody mentions it to me I say, ‘I don’t talk like that’, and then it goes away.” In the comments on the Facebook post from June 24, 2019, the author admits the transcript is a joke, writing “some people need to get their heads out of their arses and learn to laugh at life”.However, it’s clear the majority of people who commented on the text believed it to be true. The comments included: “That’s gold logie shit….. Hahaha”; “Fantastic comment from the GG as he is not the Politically correct trash like politicians”, and “general Cosgrove, thank you so much for that comment you are a legend in my book”.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158445104319186&set=a.10150837937744186&type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/equipped-quip/,https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/0813_jones1.mp3,https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/0813_jones2.mp3,https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/get-it-right-listeners/9975304,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/hoax-a-reality-of-age-cosgrove/news-story/7ee35ba97650af7540fb402dc07fb55b",Prostitute quip attributed to former Governor-General is a fake,,,,,,

Let us know below”.In the comments UniLad Tech credits Amercian 3D animator and artist Travis Sattler as the creator stating: “All credit goes to: www.instagram.com/yo_dojo/”.Mr Sattler goes by the name of Yo Dojo and his website states he creates motion graphics, Instagram content and stage visuals.  The wind turbine video is on his website gallery.Mr Sattler also posted the video on his instagram account on February 21, 2019, with the caption “DISATER STRIKES IN BAD AXE” (sic). The caption includes the hashtags #octanerender, which refers to a popular computer graphic art software, #cgi, meaning computer generated image, and #3drender.Fact checking unit Snopes investigated the same video after it was shared on social media as being real and concluded it was “a computer-based rendering and not a video record of a genuine mishap”. “It’s amazing what can be produced with a computer and 3D-rendering software,” Snopes stated in its February 25, 2019 fact check under the headline ‘Was this Wind Turbine Destroyed During a Storm?’.","https://www.facebook.com/AYCCOFFICIAL/videos/711961702534103/,https://www.aycc.org.au/about,https://www.facebook.com/pg/AYCCOFFICIAL/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2190080874541983,https://www.facebook.com/UNILADTech/videos/2359331754289939/,https://www.yodojodesign.com/about,https://www.yodojodesign.com/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BuHvu4SF8PA/,https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wind-turbine-destroyed-storm/",Coal lobby video of wind turbine disaster is not real,,,,,,
411,,,,False,,2019-07-03,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/five-metre-human-skeleton-find-a-hoax/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The StatementAAP FactCheck has examined this Facebook post by Alien Star on June 18, 2019, after it was shared more than 470 times, and attracted almost 100 comments. The pictures accompanying the Alien Star article actually show French archaeologists examining the bones of a woolly mammoth discovered near Paris in 2012 .The Facebook post links to this Alien Star website story headlined: Archaeologists from Adelaide Unearth a 17 Feet Tall Human Giant Human Skeleton in Australia.The article details how a team of archaeologists from the University of Adelaide ostensibly uncovered “the biggest human skeleton that has ever been discovered”.The AnalysisThe Alien Star Facebook page claims to share evidence of aliens on earth. Its website, purportedly based in Romania, publishes “breaking news and analysis of the latest trends and happenings around the world, in domains as Science, Space, Extraterrestrial Life, Technology, Weird and others”.AAP FactCheck found the Alien Star story was an abridged version of an story published in 2014 by the World News Daily Report (WNDR) website, titled ‘5-Meter Tall Human Skeleton Unearthed in Australia’. This Denis Gliksman image was taken at a dig site near Paris and has no connection to central Australia, or the discovery of a giant human skeleton. On its About Us page, WNDR claims to be an “American Jewish Zionist newspaper based in Tel Aviv and dedicated to covering biblical archaeology news and other mysteries around the globe”. However, the WNDR Disclaimer page states the content on the site is fictional. “WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle (sic),” the WNDR Disclaimer page states.Both stories published by Alien Star and WNDR state “a skeleton 5.3 meters tall (17 foot and 4 inches) was discovered near the ancient ruins of the only megalithic civilization ever discovered in Australia”. AAP FactCheck found a number of elements in the Alien Star post to be false.The Alien Star story sources news of the “discovery” to the Adelaide Herald, a publication that has not existed for more than 100 years. According to Trove, the online archive of the National Library of Australia, The Herald in Adelaide was a weekly trade union magazine published from 1899-1910. The photographs of workers uncovering dusty bones that accompanied the Alien Star article were actually taken in 2012 at an archaeological site near Paris, France, where the remains of a woolly mammoth were discovered.The images, distributed by Associated Press, were used in 2012 to illustrate a BBC article about the mammoth’s remains. The same images were attributed to Denis Gliksman/AP/Inrap,  in an Associated Press article published in the National Post regarding the Paris dig. Inrap is the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research which has published details of the 2012 mammoth discovery along with many similar images by Gliksman.The claim the skeleton was “discovered near the ancient ruins of the only megalithic civilization ever discovered in Australia” was floated in a separate story titled ‘Ruins Of Ancient City Discovered in Australian Desert’, published by WNDR in 2014. Both the News Corp newspaper NT News and fact-checking website Snopes found this 2014 WNDR story to be false. Snopes addressed the false story in this article titled ‘Ruins of Ancient City Discovered in Australian Desert’ , while journalist Steve Menzies debunked the same claim for the NT news in a story titled ‘Uluru’s 1500-year-old ‘lost city’ a fake’.In February 2017, after the same story surfaced again, veteran Canadian media writer and blogger Ian Chadwick again reported the story about the discovery of a giant human skeleton was a hoax. He noted on his website, Scripturient, that the story dated back to 2014 and had been recycled in 2015 and 2017.The Hoax-Slayer website also labelled the report a fake in October 2017, noting the “bogus report comes via the fake news website World News Daily Report (WNDR), which is notorious for churning out fanciful nonsense disguised as news. Nothing published on the site should be taken seriously.”","https://www.facebook.com/alienstar.org/posts/349619999045184,http://@alienstar.org,http://newsinstact.com/science/archaeologists-from-adelaide-unearth-a-17-feet-tall-human-giant-skeleton-in-australia/?fbclid=IwAR2jKolZBnLv7sKUli-BCcnIgH9gRMPey6rbQ9BWm9yjHSjpjQgMF6a-XTI,http://newsinstact.com/about/,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/5-meter-tall-human-skeleton-unearthed-in-australia/,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/about-us/,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/disclaimer_/,https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/396,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/20256142,https://nationalpost.com/news/a-rather-hairy-fossil-archaeologists-unearth-complete-skeleton-of-mammoth-in-france,https://www.inrap.fr/en/mammoth-and-humans-banks-marne-12093,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/ruins-of-ancient-city-discovered-in-australian-desert/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ruin-nation/,https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/centralian-advocate/ulurus-1500yearold-lost-city-a-fake/news-story/495f559bd7d1f7d520c6a1194091f5cc,http://ianchadwick.com/blog/hoax-five-meter-giant-skeletons/,https://www.hoax-slayer.net/fake-news-report-claims-five-meter-tall-human-skeleton-found-uluru/",Five-metre human skeleton find a hoax,,,,,,

July 1, 2019. The AnalysisNSW Farmers Association CEO Peter Arkle told Sky News TV that drought conditions had not improved a lot over the past 12 months and he was seeking support from the banks for farmers with no income who were getting council rates bills that had increased 10 per cent on the previous year. Mr Arkle said farmers were still doing it very tough having to sell a lot of stock and being unable to plant crops or suffering crop failure. AAP FactCheck examined Mr Arkle’s claim “we’ve still got 90 per cent of the state in some level of drought declaration and 30 per cent in severe drought”.NSW Farmers Association spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the source of Mr Arkle’s drought figures was the NSW Department of Primary Industries combined drought indicator. The indicator is an interactive tool which is updated daily and is used by the department to track seasonal conditions through five phases of drought. The drought indicator figures across NSW for July 1, 2019, the day Mr Arkle was interviewed, were: non drought: 0.8 per cent, recovering: 1.8 per cent, drought affected: 60.1 per cent, drought: 22.2 per cent and intense drought: 15.1 per cent. Based on these figures Mr Arkle was correct in claiming 90 per cent of NSW was suffering some level of drought. However, he was wrong in claiming 30 per cent was in severe/intense drought as the official figure is 15.1 per cent. The severe drought areas are mainly in the upper Hunter, Northern Tablelands, upper North West and the upper Western regions.A NSW Farmers Association spokesperson told AAP FactCheck Mr Arkle may have been using old figures when he stated 30 per cent.However, a year ago the percentage of NSW suffering severe drought was still 15 per cent. As of 30 June 2018, approximately 99 per cent of the state was covered by one of the three drought categories with up to 40 per cent drought affected, 44 per cent in drought and 15 per cent in intense drought.","https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6054091809001,https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/1145476332022718464,https://edis.dpi.nsw.gov.au/,https://edis.dpi.nsw.gov.au/,https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate-and-emergencies/droughthub/information-and-resources/seasonal-conditions/ssu/june-2018",Is 90 per cent of NSW drought affected and 30 per cent of the state in severe drought?,,,,,,

June 20, 2019.The AnalysisIn the lead-up to the NSW March election Premier Gladys Berejiklian committed to halving the number of people sleeping on the streets by 2025. The June state budget was criticised for not providing any funding for this target or committing any funds for any additional social and affordable housing. NSW Council of Social Service chief executive Joanna Quilty claimed the budget showed the NSW government was not committed to tackling homelessness and disadvantage. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Quilty’s claim NSW had a growing homeless population and a social housing waiting list of 60,000 people waiting up to 10 years.A 2018 NSW parliamentary research report, which analysed Australian Bureau of Statistics data across four censuses, found the number of homeless people in NSW grew from 23,041 to 37,715 between 2001 and 2016. By 2016, 32 per cent of Australia’s homeless population lived in NSW, up from 27 per cent in 2011. NSW also recorded the largest percentage increase in the number of homeless people (37.3 per cent) of any state or territory between 2011 and 2016. Based on this data AAP FactCheck found Ms Quilty’s claim that NSW has a growing homeless population to be true.Regarding Ms Quilty’s claim NSW had a social housing waiting list of 60,000, NSW Department of Family and Community Services data from June 30, 2018 showed there were 52,932 approved applicants on the NSW social housing register, not 60,000. The NSW Council of Social Service told AAP FactCheck its source for the 60,000 figure came from a NSW Audit Office report published in December 2018. The report contains a chart showing the number of households on the housing register and median waiting times for 2018. The chart confirms Ms Quilty’s claim of 60,000. The NSW Department of Family and Community Services also publishes estimated waiting times for social housing. There are four kinds of social housing available in NSW – a studio or one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, and four or more bedrooms.As of June 30 last year, three NSW zones – St George in southern Sydney, Fairfield in western Sydney and Wyong on the NSW Central Coast – had waiting times of more than 10 years for any type of property. Several zones also had waiting times of 10 years plus for at least one category of social housing.AAP FactCheck concludes that Ms Quilty’s figures on the social housing waiting list and waiting times of up to 10 years in some areas of NSW are both correct.","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/nsw-government-forced-to-intervene-to-save-dv-services-from-cuts-20190619-p51z9l.html,https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/researchpapers/Documents/NSW%20Homelessness%20by%20SED%20-%20Key%20Statistics.pdf,https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/researchpapers/Documents/NSW%20Homelessness%20by%20SED%20-%20Key%20Statistics.pdf,https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/housing/help/applying-assistance/expected-waiting-times,https://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/our-work/reports/family-and-community-services-2018government-forced-to-intervene-to-save-dv-services-from-cuts-20190619-p51z9l.html,https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/housing/help/applying-assistance/expected-waiting-times","Is homelessness growing in NSW and are there 60,000 people waiting for social housing, sometimes for up to 10 years?",,,,,,
414,,,,Mostly false,,2019-03-18,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/are-nurse-walk-in-centres-a-proven-way-to-ease-hospital-emergency-pile-ups/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“Nurse-led walk-in centres are proven.”NSW health spokesman Walt Secord announces Labor’s remedy to tackle overstretched hospital emergency departments. March 17, 2019.The AnalysisNew nurse walk-in medical centres will treat patients with non-urgent ailments under a Labor remedy to ease pressure on hospital emergency departments.ALP health spokesman Walt Secord said the nurse-led centres would be modelled on similar clinics in the ACT and the United Kingdom.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Secord’s claim, reported by The Daily Telegraph (paywall), that nurse-led medical centres were a proven cure for overcrowded emergency departments.The ACT’s first nurse walk-in centre opened at the Canberra Hospital precinct in 2010, before closing in June 2014, with two new centres opening in Belconnen and Tuggeranong the following week . A third centre opened in Gungahlin in September 2018, and another is due to open by the end of this year. There is no data for Gungahlin yet.The opening of walk-in centres did not stem a steady growth in the number of presentations to emergency departments at Canberra hospitals, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare annual reports. Every financial year from 2009/10 to 2017/18, the number of presentations to emergency departments in Canberra grew by at least 3,990, except 2011-12 which grew by only 600 – the year after the first walk-in centre opened.Patients are ranked in one of five triage categories at Australian emergency departments. The lowest categories are four and five or semi-urgent and non-urgent.AIHW annual reports show the introduction of the first walk-in clinic in 2010 coincided with a decrease in non-urgent patients (category 5) presenting to emergency from 2011/12 to 2012/13. Following the opening of the additional two centres in mid 2014, the number of non-urgent patients fell each year  in 2014-15 and 2016-17 (There is no data available for 2015/16.).However in most years since 2009/10, the number of semi-urgent presentations (category 4) increased every year by at least 1000. The exception was 2013-14 when the number fell by 110.A 2011 Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute paper found the net impact of a centre on an emergency department “could range from quite large increase in ED activity to a large decline”. It also found the average cost of a walk-in centre service, however calculated, is less than the average cost of an emergency department service and greater than the average cost of a GP service.A 2014 Scandinavian-based review said the concept of walk-in centres was first introduced in Canada in 1980. It found limited evidence to support any decrease in emergency loads where nurse-led walk-in centres were co-located with emergency departments. It said only one study on a single walk-in centre showed “a significant decline” in emergency attendances. It found further evaluations on Canberra’s centres needed to be done “to determine the impact of these services on reducing overcrowding at EDs”.AAP FactCheck found only one reference which showed a positive impact of Canberra’s walk-in centres on emergency departments. A paper from the Improving Healthcare International Convention November 2015, found that of the 32,980 total presentations at the two walk-in centres for 2014/2105 financial year, only 5.62 per cent were redirected to an emergency department while 72 per cent were treated at the centres. In the lead-up to the 2015 NSW election, then Labor leader Luke Foley announced a four-year $40 million plan to build four nurse-led walk-in clinics to “take the pressure off” hospitals. The Australian Medical Association rejected the plan saying it would not relieve pressure on emergency departments.In Britain, walk-in clinics opened in 2000 and were one of the Labour government’s flagship National Health Service (NHS) policies. About 230 opened in England in the early 2000s under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.UK studies examining the impact of walk-in centres on the workload of NHS emergency departments revealed mixed findings.In 2014, a review by English health service regulator Monitor of walk-in centres found they failed “to reduce A&E (accident and emergency) attendances” and that sometimes people were paying twice because they were also seeing their GP. It further found the centres created demand “unnecessarily” and there were concerns regarding duplicated services with A&E “based on evidence that some patients use walk-in centres and other services for the same problem”.In 2017, the British Journal of Healthcare Management review concluded due to “limited research into the long-term effects of walk-in centres, the true extent of their impact (on accident and emergency departments) was “currently unknown”.“More recent research has produced some conflicting findings, stating that walk-in centres can result in up to a 20 per cent reduction in emergency department attendances.” More recent findings showed walk-in centres “may be more effective at diverting attendances once they are more well-established in the community”.In March 2018, Britain’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said “evidence suggested that stand-alone walk-in centres may provide a benefit in ED (emergency department) avoidance” but this was based on two “low-quality” studies.In 2018, UK campaign group 38 Degrees reported 95 walk-in centres – 40 per cent of the original number – had closed in the UK since 2010. Monitor reported that 51 had closed since 2010.While patients in Canberra and overseas like walk-in medical centres because of easier access, lower costs and faster service, AAP FactCheck found little to no evidence to support Mr Secord’s claim they had a “proven” impact on reducing emergency department congestion.","https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/labor-pledges-hospital-nurse-walkin-stations-to-ease-crowding/news-story/76982570f077064168d459ce4fbd728d,http://archive.is/Kqp6U,http://archive.is/Nyo8Z,https://www.act.gov.au/our-canberra/latest-news/2018/september/gungahlin-walk-in-centre-now-open,https://www.health.act.gov.au/hospitals-and-health-centres/walk-centres,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/96d50c7b-3e0e-4aec-bd80-521ff0358162/17763.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/9ca4c770-3c3b-42fe-b071-3d758711c23a/aihw-hse-216.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://acem.org.au/Content-Sources/Advancing-Emergency-Medicine/Better-Outcomes-for-Patients/Triage,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/4b34d4b2-dc10-4c4d-ba1c-fc8e5d2ac20a/14824.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/f1a0ec92-b0eb-4a45-8648-f6f9565746f1/16299.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/0fd096e0-b481-4f92-bfe8-98d72f9c8719/19527_1.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/981140ee-3957-4d47-9032-18ca89b519b0/aihw-hse-194.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/1b305ffc-b7a4-4f80-aa66-d90614c5f8f4/12271.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/12c5ffba-0e02-47a5-b719-b831dc5e29cd/13587.pdf.aspx?inline=true,https://rsph.anu.edu.au/files/ACTHealthWalk-inCentreReport_0.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173055/,https://ihic.improve.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A7_KEUN.pdf,http://archive.is/gHowd,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283778/WalkInCentreFinalReportFeb14.pdf,https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjhc.2017.23.11.539,https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjhc.2017.23.11.539,https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng94/evidence/18.minor-injury-unit-urgent-care-centre-or-walkin-centre-pdf-172397464605,http://archive.is/PpWXs",Are nurse walk-in centres a proven way to ease hospital emergency pile-ups?,,,,,,

March 14, 2019. The AnalysisNSW Arts Minister Don Harwin and Nationals leader John Barilaro approved over $3 million in grants in coalition-held seats for 13 regional arts projects judged ineligible by an expert panel.Independent candidate for Tamworth and local councillor Mark Rodda said the funding process was unfair and “an appalling way to manage taxpayers’ funds prior to an election”.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Rodda’s claim, reported by the ABC, it was “a classic case of pork-barrelling”.According to the Macquarie Dictionary pork-barrelling is a colloquial expression for “a government appropriation, bill or policy which supplies funds for local improvements designed to ingratiate legislators with their constituents”.A NSW Government Planning and Environment document obtained by the ABC under freedom of information, and shared by the national broadcaster with AAP FactCheck, shows how funding applications for Regional Cultural Fund (RCF) grants were assessed and allocated. The document consists of 199 pages. Page 10 of the document states the NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin had identified 13 applications that were “not recommended” by the RCF panel for funding. The document states the minister then sought advice on whether to allocate funding to these 13 applications and asked “what conditions would be needed to ensure the applications met the objective of the RCF panel”.Page 82 of the document identifies 13 applications “not recommended” for funding and shows they were all for projects in NSW coalition-held seats.In May 31, 2018 when round one of RCF grants were announced, 68 projects shared $48 million worth of funding, included 13 that had not been recommended for funding by the panel.Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Deputy Premier John Barilaro, Mr Harwin and National Party whip and Myall Lakes MP Stephen Bromhead announced the round one RCF recipients at the Manning Entertainment Centre in Taree which is in the NSW seat of Myall Lakes. The Manning Entertainment Centre was one of the 13 applications “not recommended” but it received the most funding with two grants totalling $1,570,959.Here’s the 13 “not recommended” projects which received funding, listed from the largest to smallest grants together with which electoral seat they came from and who holds the seat.1: Stephen Bromhead, Nationals, Party whip; Myall Lakes MP: Mid Coast Council, Manning Entertainment Centre studio theatre space.

It is completely unfair to the councils and organisations elsewhere who do the right thing to plan their projects only to have the minister pull the rug from underneath those groups.”AAP FactCheck concludes Mr Rodda claim the NSW government is guilty of pork-barrelling is true and that his use of the term pork-barrelling is in line with the Macquarie Dictionary definition.","http://archive.is/SM7JQ,https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/news-and-publications/news/regional-cultural-fund-delivers-millions-to-fuel-a-further-56-cultural-infrastructure-projects/,https://www.manningrivertimes.com.au/story/5440507/funding-boost-for-local-arts-and-culture/,https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Regional-Cultural-Fund-Round-One-Recipients.pdf,https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Regional-Cultural-Fund-Round-One-Recipients.pdf",Is the NSW government guilty of pork-barrelling for granting arts funding to help secure coalition seats?,,,,,,

March 14, 2019.The AnalysisThe NSW government has attacked the SFF’s gun policies saying “they are pretending that they’re not party positions – they are.”AAP FactCheck examined the premier’s claims, reported in The Daily Telegraph (paywall), the SFF has policies to give guns to 10-year-olds and relax John Howard’s 1996 National Firearm Agreement.The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party was formed in 1992 by shooters and hunters who believed the 1992 NSW Firearms Amendment Act “was designed to make them the scapegoats for criminal misuse of firearms by others”. In 2016 the party changed its name to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party (SFF). The SFF holds two NSW Upper House seats and the party has increased its vote at every election since 2003.In a November 2016 NSW by-election the SFF won its first lower house seat in Orange by 56 votes after seven recounts. An SFF spokesperson told AAP FactCheck the party was fielding 25 candidates for NSW Lower House seats at the March 23 election.Back in 2011, the SFF introduced a bill to NSW parliament to remove restrictions on the age of shooters for air rifles, with a caveat that minors be supervised by parents. The bill lapsed.SFF party leader Robert Borsak said in August 2017 the party “would be happy to see minor’s permits for firearms use to be reduced from 12 years of age to 10 years.”On October 11, 2017 NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro recounted to NSW parliament a Sydney radio interview in which Mr Borsak “confirmed that he wants to see guns in the hands of 10-year-olds”. Mr Barilaro told parliament “the policy of the Shooters Party is to have 10‑year‑olds with guns on properties”. Mr Borsak told AAP FactCheck the party dumped the policy regarding 10-year-olds in October 2017 because of “community attitudes”. “We changed our policy in October 2017 and now support the existing age restrictions”, which allow 12-year-olds to use and possess guns, but not buy firearms.The SFF policy shift, reported in The Australian (paywall), followed the party’s defeat in two NSW by-elections on October 14, 2017, supposedly following “scare-mongering” over the policy by the Nationals.In February 2019, the SFF’s only NSW lower house member, Orange MP Phil Donato, reiterated the policy shift and refuted a claim by the premier that his party wanted 10-year-olds to have guns. “It’s pure scare-mongering, it’s purely trying to place fear in the community by the premier, totally false,” Mr Donato said.The premier and her Treasurer Dominic Perrottet have however maintained the SFF has a policy to give guns to 10-year-olds.On December 17, 2018, the premier called on Labor to rule out a deal with the SFF over its policy to lower the age limit for a minor’s gun permit. “People want to know what you stand for and I don’t stand for 10-year-olds having guns, I don’t stand for those laws that John Howard put in 1996 to be watered down,” Ms Berejiklian said.On February 2, 2019, Mr Perrottet likened the SFF to American gun lobby the National Rifle Association (NRA). “The opposition leader is jumping into bed with an organisation like the NRA of NSW who want to arm 10 year olds with guns,” Mr Perrottet said in a Daily Telegraph article (paywall).AAP FactCheck concludes the premier’s claim the SFF has a policy to give 10-year-olds a gun is false.Twelve days after the April 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, where 35 people were killed, prime minister John Howard announced a sweeping package of gun reforms.Cabinet papers released by the National Archives of Australia reveal a May 10, 1996 meeting with commonwealth attorney-general, Daryl Williams, and state and territory police ministers broadly adopted Mr Howard’s gun control package which became the National Firearms Agreement (NFA). The SFF’s top two policies for the 2016 federal election were to repeal the 1996 NFA and “vehemently oppose” the establishment of a Commonwealth Firearms Registry.Mr Borsak however told AAP FactCheck the premier’s claim, that SFF has a policy to “relax” Mr Howard’s gun laws, was a “complete lie”, as the party had also dropped that policy in October 2017 to “reflect community sentiment”.“There is no short-term, medium-term or long-term aim by the party to repeal the National Firearms Agreement,” he told AAP FactCheck. “We’re not looking for a relaxation of the National Firearm Agreement at all, what we are looking for is a review of the administration of the Firearms Act in New South Wales.”Mr Borsak’s claim is supported by a February 2018 story in The Australian (paywall). “After being hit with Nationals claims they wanted semi-automatic weapons introduced, the Shooters have also watered down their previous policy of having the National Firearms Agreement abolished and reworked.”However the current policies page on the SFF website lists “review the National Firearms Agreement of COAG” as its first item under firearms. Also included are plans to oppose a Commonwealth Firearms Registry or any other federal interference state firearm laws, and expand self-defence rights and non-lethal means of protection.AAP FactCheck concludes that premier’s claim regarding the currency of the SFF’s National Firearms Agreement policy is inconclusive.","https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/nsw-government-launches-attack-on-dangerous-shooters-party/news-story/1e54d9e5fdab78abe607c680fc468aba,https://www.shootersfishersandfarmers.org.au/our_party,http://archive.is/nOHy6,http://archive.is/KLfOm,https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/Pages/Profiles/firearms-legislation-amendment-bill-2011_1.aspx,http://archive.is/IOpAB,https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-99289,http://archive.is/tiYdP,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/shooters-abandon-changes-to-firearm-permits-policy/news-story/e91dadc7e77c182c761fd739c9dd7f8e,https://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/5890248/its-pure-scare-mongering-donato-says-theres-no-policy-to-give-10-year-olds-guns/,http://archive.is/5yW52,https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/shooters-party-strikes-deal-with-mark-lathams-one-nation/news-story/e6d3f61d622c82f9c63dd49a2d32c332,http://archive.is/P2hv6,http://archive.is/lWOcM,https://ssaa.org.au/news-resources/politics/shooters-fishers-and-farmers-party-election-statement/,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/shooters-abandon-changes-to-firearm-permits-policy/news-story/e91dadc7e77c182c761fd739c9dd7f8e,https://www.shootersfishersandfarmers.org.au/federal_policies-new","Does the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party (SFF) want to give guns to 10-year-olds and relax the national firearms agreement?",,,,,,
417,,,,Mostly True,,2019-03-13,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/has-the-number-of-police-working-in-northern-nsw-fallen-since-2012/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“There are less police now than there was in 2012.”Labor candidate for Tweed and former police officer Craig Elliot cites police numbers as a key issue in his northern NSW electorate. March 13, 2019.The AnalysisMore police are “desperately needed” in northern NSW according to Labor candidate Craig Elliot who has pledged to increase police numbers in his seat of Tweed if elected on March 23.AAP FactCheck has examined Mr Elliot’s claim, reported in The Australian (paywall), that there are less police stationed in Tweed now than in 2012.AAP FactCheck could not obtain a figure for the number of police in Tweed now due to a number of factors.NSW police numbers in local areas are only publicly available up until September 2017 via a NSW government website page titled police strength figures.NSW Police media said a breakdown of the number of officers in each local area command weren’t made public after September 2017 because the statistics were no longer comparable due to structural reform and changes to how officers were allocated to local areas.NSW Police Media said it could not give AAP FactCheck current police figures for any time after September 2017 because they “cannot comment on candidate claims” as NSW was in caretaker period ahead of the March 23 election.Mr Elliot told AAP FactCheck his claim was based on the published September 2017 figures for Tweed.NSW ‘Police Strength Figures’ in September 2017 show 165 officers were working in the Tweed/Byron local area command.According to NSW Police website archives, there were 189 police officers working in the Tweed/Byron local area command at the end of the 2011-2012 financial year. These figures support Mr Elliot’s claim, showing a decline in police numbers of 24 from 2012 to 2017.A spokesman for retiring NSW Police Minister Troy Grant said the reason reported police figures “appeared” to have fallen in the Tweed/Byron region since 2012 was due to a change in the way the numbers were calculated. The minister’s spokesperson said from July 1, 2012 highway traffic police no longer reported to and weren’t counted as part of local command.This change was confirmed in a March 2013 statement by a spokesman for then NSW Police Minister Mike Gallacher and a Police Association northern region spokesperson who said a restructure by the NSW police force and the creation of a Traffic and Highway Patrol Command “had created the impression the number of operational officers had dropped”.“Highway patrol officers are still stationed in their Local Area Command but the staff come under that different command,” the Police Association spokesperson said in a Northern Star news report.In the month following the transfer of highway police to another command, figures dropped from 189 (June 2012) to 167 (July 2012). Figures for July 2012 show a drop of two officers from 2012 to 2017 which means Mr Elliot’s statement is still correct, but only just.Mr Elliot agreed the way the figures were calculated had changed after July 1, 2012 but stood by his claim. “It doesn’t matter which way you cut and dice the figures, there are still less police in the Tweed today than there were before,” the former Queensland police officer told AAP FactCheck. “This government has the wrong priorities on police numbers. Their focus is Sydney-centric and the regions like the Tweed have been ignored.”Overall however, the number of NSW police officers across the state has increased since June 2012 – from 15,977 to 16,788 in June 2018 – an increase of 811 over six years.AAP FactCheck found Mr Elliot’s claim to be mostly true due to one problem. Current figures could not be verified due to a halt in public reporting since September 2017 and NSW Police declining to supply any data because the NSW government was in caretaker mode.","https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/stadium-debate-opening-labor-doors-in-nationals-seats/news-story/78bfbf6c28e5e0316bd1e6de6df6c7c3,https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/about_us/information_of_interest_to_the_community/police_strength_data,https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/about_us/information_of_interest_to_the_community/police_strength_data,https://web.archive.org/web/20140623051813/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/240094/June_2012.pdf,http://archive.is/9jT5w,https://web.archive.org/web/20140623051813/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/240094/June_2012.pdf,https://web.archive.org/web/20140623051808/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/242356/July_2012.pdf,https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/14689,https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/611538/NSW_Police_Force_2017-18_Annual_Report.pdf",Has the number of police working in northern NSW fallen since 2012?,,,,,,

I think the stats stack up and talk for themselves.”NSW Deputy Premier and Skills Minister John Barilaro says his government’s technical and vocational training package is better than Labor’s offering. February 27, 2019.The AnalysisThe Berejiklian government has promised to lift the number of free TAFE (Technical And Further Education) and VET (Vocational Education Training) courses to nearly 700,000 over four years if re-elected on March 23. The free courses include aged care, disability care, hospitality and construction. AAP FactCheck investigated the claims made by NSW Deputy Premier and Skills Minister John Barilaro to determine if his government’s election pledge to offer job seekers free TAFE and VET education would deliver more courses and in a faster time frame than Labor.The NSW government’s election pledge includes an extra 100,000 fee-free courses, including 70,000 courses for young job seekers and 30,000 courses for mature-age workers at an additional total cost of $85 million. These additional places will bring the total number of free courses to 688,000 by the end of 2023.Mr Barilaro says the additional places are on top of almost 150,000 free apprenticeship TAFE and VET courses already offered each year. The near 150,000 places over four years brings the government’s total offering to “700,000 over four years”.The Liberals new package will include courses available at TAFE colleges and privately-owned VET providers and will start from 2020. These free courses will be offered in any category on the NSW skills list which covers all qualification levels, select foundation skills courses, all apprenticeships and selected traineeships. Labor has promised to fund “more than” 600,000 TAFE places ‘fee-free’ over the next decade. Of these 600,000, 114,343 will be rolled out over four years from January 2020 to December 2022, at a cost of $64.5 million, a Labor spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.Labor will make fee-free places available at government-owned TAFE colleges only, vowing to cap the funding available to privately-owned VET providers at 30 per cent of the state’s total spending on the sector.Labor’s plan also includes all qualification levels, but only in study areas with skill deficits, starting with childcare, aged care, disability care, construction, plumbing and the electrical trades. In summary, the NSW government is currently offering 150,000 TAFE and VET places per year and will offer an extra 100,000 places from 2020 to 2023, making a total of 688,000 over the four years. Labor will offer 114,343 of 600,000 TAFE and VET places over the four years from 2020 to 2023, with the remainder being offered over the following six years.AAP FactCheck concludes Mr Barilaro’s claim that his government will deliver more TAFE and VET course in a shorter time frame than the Labor opposition is true. However, Mr Barilaro rounded up the number of places from 688,000 to 700,000 in his quote.","https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/100000-extra-free-tafe-and-vet-courses-to-be-provided-under-berejiklian-government/news-story/9fb4922e3131e16b176a84586d4e5b78,https://nsw.liberal.org.au/Our-Plans/Policies/100,000-NEW-FREE-TAFE-VET-COURSES,https://nsw.liberal.org.au/Our-Plans/Policies/100,000-NEW-FREE-TAFE-VET-COURSES,https://www.training.nsw.gov.au/smartandskilled/nsw_skills_list.html,https://www.michaeldaley.com.au/labor_will_make_tafe_free_for_courses_in_skill_shortage_areas,https://www.michaeldaley.com.au/labor_will_make_tafe_free_for_courses_in_skill_shortage_areas,https://www.michaeldaley.com.au/labor_will_make_tafe_free_for_courses_in_skill_shortage_areas",Will the NSW government deliver more free technical and vocational courses for job seekers in a faster time frame than Labor if re-elected?,,,,,,

February 23, 2019  The AnalysisNSW Labor’s transport spokeswoman Jodi McKay vowed to end the “war on cyclists” by spending $412 million on new bikeways and footpaths if Labor wins the March 23 state election.AAP FactCheck has examined Ms McKay’s claims that building more cycleways and footpaths will lead to fewer cars on the road, less pollution, lower emissions and a boost to public health and wellbeing.There are numerous studies supporting Ms McKay’s position on the benefits of building additional “active transport” infrastructure.Other reports, however, show that while increasing cycleways and footpaths is great for city residents, there is a lesser impact in outer suburban, regional and rural areas where greater distances prohibit cycling and walking as a mode of transport.A December 2018 study by New Zealand’s University of Otago and the Victoria University of Wellington found cycling and walking infrastructure reduced car use and carbon dioxide emissions.In the three years after the development of the new infrastructure in two small NZ cities, there was a reduction of 1.6 per cent in vehicle kilometres travelled and an associated one per cent drop in carbon emissions, a report on the NZ study found.New Plymouth and Hastings, the two cities in the study, were selected by the New Zealand government in 2011 as “walking and cycling model communities” and received grants of $NZ13.1 million ($A12.5 million).A 2011 report by the Brussels-based European Cycling Federation (ECF), which tracked the environmental impact of cycling in Europe, found transport greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by more than 25 per cent if every country’s residents cycled as regularly as the Danes.The study found the average Dane cycled almost 965km each year. If that rate was replicated across Europe the bloc would achieve up to 26 per cent of its targeted transport emissions reductions, depending on what forms of transport cycling replaced.A 2011 study commissioned by the Queensland government found a number of economic and health benefits per kilometre walked or cycled. The benefits included decongestion and savings in health costs, vehicle operating costs, infrastructure and the environment.Ms McKay’s claim that building more cycleways and footpaths helped boost public health and wellbeing was also supported by a number of studies, with the benefits of cycling outweighing any potential negative effects of air pollution and safety.A 2017 British Medical Journal study found people who cycled to work had a 41 per cent lower risk of dying compared with commuting by car or public transport. Cyclists also had a 52 per cent lower risk of dying from heart disease and a 40 per cent lower risk of dying from cancer.In 2016 scientists at Britain’s University of Cambridge and University of East Anglia who studied the risks of walking and cycling in varying levels of air pollution around the world found only the worst one per cent of polluted cities would reduce the health benefits of cycling. Dr Marko Tainio from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said: “Even in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world, people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits.”Dr Tainio’s findings were further supported by researchers from Columbia University which used personal monitoring devices to examine how air pollution affects cyclists’ health.Other Australian studies and reports found the multi-pronged “active transport” approach (page 26) of creating more cycleways and footpaths, when combined with public transport, helped turn the dial in reducing traffic, pollution and emissions.This multi-pronged approach was supported by government studies which found walking as a mode of transport was declining across Australia.Other reports showed additional cycleways and footpaths had a lesser impact in areas where distances were too great to commute on bike or foot.The Australian government’s 2013 Walking, Riding and Access to Public Transport ministerial statement acknowledged (page four) walking is rarely viable for distances greater than two kilometres, or 20 minutes, largely limiting it to being a method of transport for inner city populations.However, inner city areas are likely to be inaccessible or inconvenient for cars due to parking and congestion issues, meaning people there are more inclined to commute by foot.Inner city CBDs tend to have well-developed existing pedestrian infrastructure, therefore additional “active transport” infrastructure may not have as big an impact.AAP FactCheck concludes Ms McKay correctly highlights the benefits of additional cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, however, the impacts may not be felt to the same extent in rural and regional centres.","https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/labor-vows-end-to-war-on-cyclists-with-412m-for-active-transport-20190222-p50zmm.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2018/12/05/cycleways-quickly-encourage-people-to-drive-less-finds-study-from-car-dependent-new-zealand/,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/12/cycle-like-danes-cut-emissions,https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/infrastructure/pab/active_transport/files/infra1874_mcu_active_travel_report_final.pdf,https://theconversation.com/cycling-to-work-major-new-study-suggests-health-benefits-are-staggering-76292,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160505085310.htm,https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/science/does-air-pollution-reduce-cyclings-health-benefits.aspx,https://www.activehealthykidsaustralia.com.au/siteassets/documents/2018/ahka-report-card-long-form-2018-final-for-web.pdf,https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/business-industry/partners-and-suppliers/lgr/sydneys-walking-future.pdf,https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/infrastructure/pab/active_transport/files/infra1874_mcu_active_travel_report_final.pdf,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-29/walking-isnt-just-good-for-you-its-good-for-the-economy/10558742",Will we be healthier and suffer less from pollution if more cycleways and footpaths are built?,,,,,,

They failed to build new bricks and mortar classrooms for eight long years.”NSW Opposition Leader Michael Daley pledges to replace unpopular demountables with permanent classrooms in public schools. February 24, 2019The AnalysisWith the NSW election looming on March 23, Labor leader Michael Daley has committed, as reported by The Daily Telegraph (paywall), $1.4 billion to fixing the state’s public schools by building more bricks-and-mortar classrooms.AAP FactCheck has examined Mr Daley’s claim that since being elected in 2011 the Liberal government has failed to build permanent classrooms in public schools and has been masking “severe overcrowding” by installing demountables.Mr Daley’s claim the NSW Liberal government “failed to build new bricks-and-mortar classrooms for eight long years” is not true.In March 2015, a NSW Department of Education spokesman told The Sydney Morning Herald: “Since 2011, 18 new and relocated schools and 44 major upgrade projects have been announced. These projects will provide 694 new and permanent classrooms and more than 10,000 student places.”Education Infrastructure NSW was set up by the NSW Liberal government in 2017 to “oversee the planning, supply, and maintenance of NSW schools”.In June 2018, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet announced as part of the NSW Budget that 230 new and upgraded schools had been completed since 2011.According to Education Infrastructure NSW, the state government announced 17 new and upgraded schools would open for the first day of Term 1 in 2019, providing almost 400 new classrooms for students across the state.Mr Daley’s claim demountables are “supposed to be used temporarily” is supported by a statement NSW Education Minister Rob Stokes made in parliament last December. “The Department of Education uses demountable buildings to manage changing enrolment patterns; provide accommodation to meet emergency needs … and provide temporary accommodation needs as a result of capital works and maintenance projects,” Mr Stokes said.Mr Daley’s claim the “Liberals have been piling them [demountables] into schools” was unable to be verified by comparative statistics. However in 2017, the independent Government News website reported the NSW Labor opposition, using Freedom of Information, obtained an Education Department document that showed 6114 demountables were in use in NSW schools and TAFE sites.There was clear evidence supporting Mr Daley’s reference to “severe overcrowding” in NSW public schools.NSW education department data released in 2018 showed 636 schools in NSW had reached or exceeded capacity – the equivalent of almost a third, or 31 per cent, of all public schools.Two years earlier, The SMH reported similar statistics showing more than 800 public schools across NSW were operating at 100 per cent capacity or more, and of those 800, a total of 180 were above capacity.AAP FactCheck concludes Mr Daley’s claim the Liberal government had not built any new classrooms in the past eight years is false, while his assertion the Liberal government was “piling them [demountables] into schools’’ could not be verified. He was correct to say there is severe overcrowding in NSW schools and that demountables are meant to be temporary.","https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/school-demountables-to-go-under-14b-labor-classroom-pledge/news-story/553d51af6fea210eaa1e22282d3f744b?login=1,https://www.smh.com.au/education/nsw-needs-385-new-classrooms-every-year-for-a-decade-20150310-13zzud.html,https://www.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/news/delivering-school-infrastructure/,https://education.nsw.gov.au/news/media-releases/more-new-classrooms,-preschool-places-and-teachers-in-$17.3-billion-education-budget,https://www.schoolinfrastructure.nsw.gov.au/news/2019/01/the-class-of-2019-to-take-their-seats-in-hundreds-of-new-classro.html,https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/la/papers/Documents/2018/21-december-2018-questions-and-answers/218-QandA-P.pdf,https://www.governmentnews.com.au/demountable-classrooms-stay-nsw/,https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/06/06/14/07/most-overcrowded-schools-in-sydney-revealed,https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/there-are-180-nsw-schools-over-capacity-department-of-education-figures-show-20160829-gr3nz7.html",Are NSW public schools overcrowded and relying on demountable classrooms because of a failure to build permanent structures?,,,,,,

February 8, 2019. The AnalysisThe profits being reported by big power companies have prompted federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor to renew his push for greater protections for electricity consumers. AAP FactCheck has examined Mr Taylor’s assertion, reported in The Daily Telegraph (paywall), that companies such as AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia – often referred to as the big three of electricity retailers – are experiencing record profits as their customers struggle to pay their bills.In 2018, AGL reported an after tax profit of $1.587 billion, up 194 per cent on the previous year. While this was a huge jump in profit, it did not surpass the $1.596b net profit it reported in 2009 [3], and was therefore not a record – or new highest – profit. Origin Energy recorded a $218m statutory net profit in 2018 but made more in 2014, 2013 and 2012.Both companies have reported net losses within the past five years, and together with the above figures, this establishes no pattern of ever-increasing earnings by two of the three biggest power companies operating in Australia.In its latest annual report (page three), EnergyAustralia, owned by Hong Kong-based company CLP Group, made a $440 million (HK$2.74b) operating profit – a 48.1 per cent jump on the previous year. This was the highest operating profit since CLP Group rebranded TRUenergy as EnergyAustralia after purchasing the retail operation from the NSW Government in 2011. While earnings have varied considerably over this time, no losses were reported by the final member of the ‘big three’.Turning to consumers, it is widely acknowledged that high electricity bills have had a negative impact on businesses and households.In her January 2019 written submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics Inquiry into the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2018, AGL General Manager for Competition Regulation & Strategy Beth Griggs acknowledged the pricing concerns of her customers.“We recognise that despite some recent price reductions, high energy prices are having a significant impact on households and businesses, and that our customers’ concerns with these cost pressures need to be considered alongside those of energy security and environmental sustainability,” she said (page one of the AGL submission).A similar sentiment was expressed by Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria in his submission to the same inquiry.“We agree with the government on the need to get electricity prices down for households and businesses,” he said.He rejected the Bill being considered, instead favouring 56 recommendations made in July 2018 by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).The federal government had asked the ACCC to prepare a report for its Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry, and it recommended a raft of measures aimed at fixing the causes of high electricity prices across the entire supply chain.“It is clear that most households are paying far too much for electricity. In addition, some of the most vulnerable in our community are forced to struggle through freezing winters and scorching summers, with many others also having difficulty paying their bills,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.Prior to the inquiry and ACCC report, a 2017 paper titled Empowering Disadvantaged Households to Access Affordable Clean Energy was released by the Australian Council of Social Service in collaboration with the Brotherhood of St Laurence and The Climate Institute. “Despite being an essential service, electricity prices are skyrocketing, disconnections have increased, the number of households experiencing measurable hardship has risen, and more households are rationing energy to the detriment of their health and well-being,” it said (page seven). The report said there were about three million people living below the poverty line in Australia but noted the number of people experiencing energy bill stress “is likely to be much higher than the poverty figures”.Australian Bureau of Statistics data from the Household Expenditure Survey released in August 2017 showed the average weekly household spend on domestic fuel and power costs had increased by 25 per cent between 2009/10 and 2015/16. ME Bank’s 12th biannual Household Financial Comfort Report was released in June 2017 based on a survey of 1,500 Australian households.“The report finds households have been hit with bill shock in the first half of 2017 and are anticipating more to come. This is unsurprising given the much publicised energy price hikes from July 1,” ME Consulting economist and report co-author Jeff Oughton said in a statement.However, facing pressure on a number of fronts and with wholesale energy prices falling, major energy companies began lowering prices in 2018 and the impact of this is still filtering through.From January 1, 2019, a combined total of about one million customers of the big three retailers – based in NSW, Victoria, South East Queensland and South Australia – were granted further discounts of up to 15 per cent on their bills.By the time the 15th Household Financial Comfort Report was published in February 2019, households indicated the cost of necessities such as fuel, utilities and groceries continued to be the biggest negative influence on their financial comfort “although the proportion nominating this as their biggest worry has fallen seven points to 46% during the six months to December 2018” (page 21).AAP FactCheck concludes big power companies are not continuing to take record profits, but a cross-section of sources concur high electricity prices have led to stress and/or hardship for consumers, despite recent price cuts.","https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/aussies-should-be-outraged-agl-not-passing-savings-on-to-struggling-families-energy-minister/news-story/e15f33882cf66b1001b42f239b74ebb2,https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/investors/results-centre#past,https://www.agl.com.au/-/media/agl/about-agl/documents/media-center/asx-and-media-releases/2009/20090924_annualreport.pdf?la=en&hash=307983FC5B6F5D3FAA2BEDFA132D7C5A,http://archive.today/LAz3r,https://www.originenergy.com.au/content/dam/origin/about/investors-media/documents/annual-report-2013.pdf,https://www.clpgroup.com/en/Investors-Information-site/Documents/Financial%20Report%20PDF/e_2017%20Annual%20Report.pdf,http://archive.today/QkULP,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/TLABEnergyMarketMiscon/Submissions,http://archive.today/GjJ3M,https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Retail%20Electricity%20Pricing%20Inquiry%E2%80%94Final%20Report%20June%202018_0.pdf,http://archive.today/QrC6m,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ACOSS_BSL_TCI_Empowering-households.pdf,https://www.acoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ACOSS_BSL_TCI_Empowering-households.pdf,https://www.abs.gov.au/household-expenditure,https://mebankstore01.blob.core.windows.net/kenticodevmedia/mebank/media/mebank/azure/documents/pr/household%20financial%20comfort%20report/household-financial-comfort-report-june-2017.pdf,http://archive.today/c5shg,http://archive.today/yZlvP,https://www.mebank.com.au/getmedia/899ccb18-7fe5-4868-b51b-b64ad2b467cf/216317_HFCR-Jan-2019_V11-WEB.pdf",Are big energy companies enjoying a run of record profits as customers struggle to pay power bills?,,,,,,

January 22, 2019 The AnalysisPrime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia has met, and will continue to meet, carbon emissions reduction targets identified within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).AAP FactCheck examined the veracity of Mr Morrison’s claim Australia hit its first Kyoto protocol target, is on track to meet its second Kyoto target, and will also achieve its Paris Agreement emissions reductions goals for 2030.The Kyoto Protocol gives effect to the UNFCCC objective of reducing human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an effort to address climate change.As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, Australia committed to limiting increases in net annual GHG emissions to 108 per cent of its 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. The National Inventory Report 2012 shows Australia surpassed its first Kyoto target, with emissions averaging 565 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (Mt CO2-e) , or 103 per cent of the 1990 base level.Australia also committed to reducing its net annual GHG emissions to 99.5 per cent of 1990 levels for the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period (2013–20). This is consistent with Australia’s stated 2020 target to reduce emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels.Australia’s Emissions Projections 2018 report, released by the Department of the Environment and Energy on December 21, 2018 [4], showed Australia is on track to “overachieve on its 2020 target” by 367 Mt CO2-e inclusive of carry-over, or 240 Mt CO2-e without carryover.Carryover refers (page six) to surplus emission units ‘carried over’ from a prior Kyoto Protocol commitment period and used in the next period.[5]Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target, set out in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement which takes effect in 2020, is to reduce net annual emissions to 26–28 per cent below 2005 levels.This represents a cumulative emissions reduction of between 695-762 Mt CO2-e between 2021 and 2030.“Total emissions in 2030 are projected to be 563 Mt CO2-e, which is seven per cent below 2005 levels (605 Mt CO2-e),” Australia’s Emissions Projections 2018 report stated (on page 10).“Emissions to 2030 are projected to grow four per cent above 2020 levels, driven by higher emissions from LNG production, increased transport activity, a declining forest sink … and growth in agricultural activity after a return to average seasonal conditions.”If the above projections are correct, Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction goal by at least 19 percentage points.Mr Morrison’s position that Australia will meet the 2030 Paris target relies on the application of carryover credits from the previous Kyoto targets. In this case, the Paris target would be offset by the credits accrued from 367 Mt CO2-e, bringing the total reduction in emissions required by 2030 down to between 328 – 395 Mt. This is a lower target than the 563 Mt CO2-e reduction Australia is projected to achieve by 2030.“The emissions gap has fallen from 3.3 billion tonnes (in 2008) to just 328 million tonnes, including ‘carryover’ from the extra emissions Australia has cut during the first and second Kyoto Protocol commitments,” Mr Morrison told media in December 2018. [6]“That significant progress highlights Australia is going to meet our 2030 target in a canter with the suite of policies our government has put in place that suppor­t the environment, while also delivering on our plan for a stronger economy.”The Greens, Labor, and some climate lobby groups assert that using carryover credits is not in the spirit of the Paris agreement [7],[8], while other nations – such as New Zealand and Britain – have voluntarily ruled out applying carry-over credits to their 2030 targets.The official rule book for the Paris Agreement was not finalised when Mr Morrison’s statement was made in January 2019, meaning the use of carryover credits has not been formally addressed by the UNFCCC.However, it is disingenuous for Mr Morrison to claim his government will meet the 2030 target “in a canter” thanks to its policies, when the government’s own projections show emissions in 2030 will grow 4 per cent over 2020 levels.Australia’s ability to meet the Paris target hinges completely on the application of carryover credits.It is AAP FactCheck’s determination that Mr Morrison was correct to say Australia has met Kyoto 1, and was also correct to say Australia is on track to meet Kyoto 2. While ever the UNFCCC has no specific objection to carryover credits being applied to the 2030 goals, then Australia should meet its reduced Paris target too.","http://archive.today/FSSJE,http://archive.today/EFYse,http://archive.today/SP1JX,http://archive.today/EFYse,http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/128ae060-ac07-4874-857e-dced2ca22347/files/australias-emissions-projections-2018.pdf,https://unfccc.int/files/national_reports/national_communications_and_biennial_reports/application/pdf/024851_australia-nc7-br3-1-aus_natcom_7_br_3_final.pdf,http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/128ae060-ac07-4874-857e-dced2ca22347/files/australias-emissions-projections-2018.pdf,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/morrison-takes-credits-to-meet-2030-paris-emissions-target/news-story/92d5d853ec420714387b0c1ccf5bccb4,https://www.adambandt.com/12_21_government_confirms_climate_accounting_trick_as_pollution_continues_to_rise_greens,http://archive.is/kmFqS",Is Australia really meeting its Kyoto and Paris targets for carbon emission reductions?,,,,,,

January 15, 2019 The AnalysisAn increase in the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs to control nursing home residents – revealed in a submission to the upcoming Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality – is systemic and masking true health issues, Council on the Ageing CEO Ian Yates says.AAP FactCheck examined Mr Yates’ claim, reported in The Australian (paywall), there had been a significant shift toward the use of chemical restraints in nursing homes over the past decade, and that this meant the full extent of restraint usage was hidden.A 2009 study into psychotropic medication use in 44 Sydney aged-care homes, published in the Medical Journal of Australia, found more than 28 per cent of residents were taking antipsychotic medications. The researchers noted that six years earlier in 2003, drug use in the same group was 24 per cent.A 2014 report commissioned by Alzheimer’s Australia found overuse and inappropriate use of chemical restraints with “about half the number of people in residential aged care facilities and up to 80 per cent of those with dementia receiving psychotropic medications”. The evidence further suggested some medications were prescribed inappropriately.Research conducted over the two years to 2016 by The Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre’s Dr Juanita Westbury examined the overuse of medication in 150 Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF) around Australia. It found about two thirds of RACF residents were prescribed psychotropic medications.Also in 2014, an Australian Senate Committee Report into dementia care found “a troubling trend” in the increased use of chemical restraints as a management tool for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. The report included anecdotal evidence of “increasing reports of the use of restraints, particularly chemical restraints in aged-care settings”.Evidence from the Department of Health and Ageing then confirmed to the committee “the use of PBS-listed antipsychotics is growing at a higher than expected rate. It is growing at a higher rate in the elderly … In February 2013 it (the drug utilisation subcommittee) found that there is a high and inappropriate utilisation of antipsychotics in the elderly.”Mr Yates’ assertion that the increased use of chemical restraints was “hidden” was supported by Elder Rights Advocacy’s evidence to the same Senate committee. The ERA said: “General Practitioners (GPs) were prescribing drugs at the behest of facilities who are insufficiently staffed to deal with people with dementia: As staffing pressures appear to mount – that is the message from the industry – they are using it as a soft restraint. It is not that soft but you do not see it and that is the only difference in it.”These studies and reports listed above and dating back to 2003 support the claim that there has been an increase in the use of chemical restraints to control elderly residents in aged-care facilities over the past decade or longer. There is also evidence pointing to chemical restraints being overused, prescribed inappropriately and hidden. There was no evidence to establish a decrease in the use of physical restraints in elder care, nor to demonstrate a correlation between a decline in physical restraints and an increase in the use of chemical restraints.","https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/health/nursing-home-residents-doped-for-years-at-a-time/news-story/1fb477661e70d5285ab3978e6525a5a9,https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2011/194/5/2009-survey-psychotropic-medication-use-sydney-nursing-homes?0=ip_login_no_cache%3Dbea2e3fb8938bda268c1c8d946d26ab1,https://www.dementia.org.au/files/NATIONAL/documents/Alzheimers-Australia-Numbered-Publication-38.pdf,https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2018/208/9/reduse-reducing-antipsychotic-and-benzodiazepine-prescribing-residential-aged,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Dementia/Report/c06,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Dementia/Report/c06,https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Dementia/Report/c06",Are psychotropic drugs becoming the preferred method of restraining nursing home residents?,,,,,,

January 16, 2019The AnalysisThe price of West Australian rock lobster is set to fall (at 13min 30sec) according to WA Premier Mark McGowan thanks to his government’s plan to increase the commercial catch and quarantine a percentage for the domestic market.AAP FactCheck examined the veracity of Mr McGowan’s statement that virtually all WA rock lobster is exported to China, which has led to local lobster prices of around $100/kg. His assertion that prices would fall once a percentage of an increased commercial rock lobster catch was quarantined for the WA market has also been tested. Government and industry data support Mr McGowan’s statement that nearly all commercially-caught WA rock lobster is exported to China.A WA Government fisheries fact sheet dated December 2018 states “currently more than 95 per cent of commercially caught WA rock lobster is exported to China”.In 2017, a Western Rock Lobster Council report found “strong demand for live exported western rock lobster to China has seen the price rise steadily, taking market share away from traditional markets of Japan, Taiwan and the USA. Today it is estimated that China is the destination for more than 90 per cent of the live export market”.Meanwhile, seafood retailers in WA were advertising online sales of rock lobster for more than the $100/kg highlighted by Mr McGowan.A live WA rock lobster weighing between 971g-1221g can be purchased from WA’s Geraldton Fishermen’s Co-operative Ltd for $113. Manetta Seafood Market sells WA rock lobster online with “pricing calculated on a minimum weight of 500g at $120.00/kg”.The claim that quarantining a percentage of an increased commercial catch for the domestic market would make more WA rock lobster available to local consumers is also backed up by industry and government figures.The WA Government’s fisheries fact sheet outlined plans to increase the lobster catch to the sustainable maximum of 8,000 tonne per annum within 5 years, representing an overall increase of 1,700 tonnes. “Of the 1,700 tonne increase, 315 tonnes will be issued to current licence holders in 2019 with the remaining 1,385 tonnes made available to the Western Australian Government,” it said.Fishing Families WA, a coalition of fishers, processors and unit holders, concurred, saying under the McGowan government plan, 27 per cent more lobsters (1,700 tonne) would be fished with the state government taking 17.3 per cent (1,385 tonne).Mr McGowan’s prediction that the above measures would make WA rock lobster more affordable for consumers cannot be verified. Mr McGowan told Radio 6PR (at 17min 00sec) “If you increase supply it puts downward pressure on prices. Market economics means that if you increase supply, competition and availability will mean prices will go down.” What remains unknown is what demand there will be from WA consumers for the increased supply of lobster and what impact that will have on current price.","http://archive.today/J5ifw,https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/MediaDocuments/Lobster%20fact%20sheet.pdf,https://www.westernrocklobster.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Economic-Contribution-of-the-Western-Rock-Lobster-Industry-Final-Repo....pdf,https://www.wacrays.com.au/shop.html,https://www.manettas.com.au/product/western-australian-lobster-sydney/,https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/MediaDocuments/Lobster%20fact%20sheet.pdf,https://fishingfamilieswa.org.au/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI09i8g8Dz3wIVwTUrCh3imQLGEAAYASAAEgLW0PD_BwE,http://archive.ph/J5ifw",Will WA rock lobster be cheaper if the state government increases domestic supply?,,,,,,

January 9, 2019.The AnalysisA publicly-accessible national register of child sex offenders would act as a deterrent to pedophiles, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has said while urging all states and territories to get behind the scheme.AAP FactCheck has examined the veracity of Mr Dutton’s assertion, reported in The Australian (paywall), that such a register would act as a deterrent to offenders.The federal government dismissed the idea of a national child sex offender register in 2014 shortly after the Northern Territory began considering a bill proposing a state-based public register. The NT bill, nicknamed Daniel’s Law in reference to Queensland 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe who was kidnapped and murdered by a serial child sex offender in 2003, stalled amid strong opposition and was withdrawn from the NT Parliament in December 2015. It was modelled on Megan’s Law, a US federal law with many state equivalents. Two reviews of Megan’s Law were summarised in 2007 by the Australian Institute of Criminology, which concluded: “There was little evidence of impact on sex offending, in particular, of offender recidivism rates being affected by community notification, or of reduced assaults by strangers on children”.Further to this, the foreword of the 2006 research paper: Megan’s Law: Does It Protect Children?, commissioned by the UK’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, states: “Although the law is popular with parents, there is no evidence that open access to sex offender registers actually enhances child safety. There is no evidence that Megan’s Law reduces reoffending. However, there is some evidence that it may have unintended negative consequences for children.” In 2008, the US Department of Justice published its own study on the impact of Megan’s Law. It concluded: “Megan’s Law showed no demonstrable effect in reducing sexual re-offenses. Megan’s Law has no effect on the type of sexual re-offense or first time sexual offense (still largely child molestation/incest). Megan’s Law has no effect on reducing the number of victims involved in sexual offenses.”Support groups in Australia that have spoken against Mr Dutton’s current plan have rejected the premise of his statement. The Blue Knot Foundation, that supports people who have experienced complex trauma, said while a public child-sex offender register may “appear to reduce the likelihood of first time offenders they do not reduce recidivism for convicted sex offenders. In fact some studies have shown that they might increase the likelihood of re-offending, whilst non-public sex offenders registries do reduce offenders as they assist law enforcement.”In its response, Child advocacy group Bravehearts pointed to its November 2017 position paper: Community Notification of Sex Offenders. It said: “There is no current evidence that community notification reduces sex offence recidivism or increases community safety (Agan, 2011; Kruse, 2007; Maguire & Singer, 2011).In an early study of offenders who were subject to notification, Schram and Milloy (1995) found that 42% of adult offenders reoffended (offences included sexual and non-sexual crimes) and 79% of juvenile offenders subject to notification were arrested for new offences. This study also found no statistically significant differences in recidivism rates for sex offences between offenders who were subjected to notification (19% recidivism) and those who were not (22%).”Taking into account the above information, the assertion that a national public register of child sex offenders would have a deterrent effect on offenders cannot be supported.","https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/dutton-spruiks-public-register-to-track-childsex-offenders/news-story/2335983e9467b0f0ca169c60f518bd70,https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/3451262/upload_binary/3451262.pdf%3BfileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22Sex%20offenders%20public%20media%20pressrel%202010s%20abbott,%20tony,%20mp%22,https://web.archive.org/web/20141222145358/https://www.danielmorcombe.com.au/blog/daniel-s-law,https://aic.gov.au/publications/crm/crm058,https://sosen.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/megans_law_review.pdf,https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225370.pdf,http://archive.is/8phq9,https://bravehearts.org.au/paedophile-register-a-political-ploy-that-fails-the-child-protection-test/,https://bravehearts.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Postion-Paper_Notification-of-Sex-Offenders_updatedNov2017.pdf,https://bravehearts.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Postion-Paper_Notification-of-Sex-Offenders_updatedNov2017.pdf",Will a national public register of child sex offenders have a strong deterrent effect on pedophiles?,,,,,,
426,,,,Ambiguous,,2018-12-20,,factcheck_aap,,https://www.aap.com.au/do-a-quarter-of-all-australian-children-live-with-violence/,,,factcheck_aap,,"The Statement“There are one in four Australian children who live with violence, and in continuing dysfunctional relationships.”Domestic violence campaigner Libby Lloyd, advocating for ongoing funding of programs proven to reduce violence against women and children. December 14, 2018.The AnalysisIn lobbying the federal government to cement ongoing funding for programs reducing domestic violence, White Ribbon Foundation in Australia co-founder Libby Lloyd said one in four Australian children are enduring violence.AAP FactCheck examined the statistic used by Ms Lloyd during her address to a recent Council of Australian Governments meeting.The term “living with violence” has emerged in recent years to more fully describe the range of physical and emotional experiences of children from violent homes. It can include being a direct victim of violence, witnessing violence, being forced to participate in violence or support a parent suffering violence, among other things.The White Ribbon Australia website attributes the “one in four” statistic to the 2011 literature review titled The Impact of Domestic Violence on Children, conducted by Megan Sety.That review included a report titled Young Australians and Domestic Violence, authored by David Indermaur. Indermaur’s report is based on original research conducted in 1989 and 1990. At the time, it was the biggest survey of its kind, capturing the direct experiences of 5000 young people aged between 12 and 20 years old from across Australia.The survey, conducted by the Crime Research Centre and Donovan Research, found “about one-quarter (23%) of the 5,000 young people reported at least one act that could be described as physical domestic violence against their mothers or stepmothers”. This marries with Ms Lloyd’s use of the “one in four” statistic. However it is worth noting here that the term ‘children’ – used by Ms Lloyd – commonly does not include people over the age of 18.Further, Sety’s literature review says: “More than one million Australian children are affected by domestic violence, according to the Personal Safety Survey (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006)”. Separately, the ABS put Australia’s population of children (in this case, young people aged 14 and below) in 2006 at 4.1 million. On face value, this again equates to roughly one quarter of Australian children, aligning with Ms Lloyd’s comment. However the 2016 Personal Safety Survey notes it was the first to collect data related to witnessing domestic violence as a child, so the 2006 data does not perfectly fit with the Ms Lloyd’s use of the term “living with violence”.The combined effect of the 2006 ABS population data and Personal Safety Survey roughly aligns with the results of the 1989/90 survey of young people conducted by the Crime Research Centre and Donovan Research. While the age ranges differ across the data sets, overall it appears to confirm Ms Lloyd’s assertion that one in four Australian children have experienced, or continue to live with violence.However, it is AAP FactCheck’s position that the data relied upon by White Ribbon Australia is between 12 and 28 years old, and it has not been possible to find relevant, comparable data for the current day. Also, the data does not neatly fit with the phrasing used by Ms Lloyd, specifically the term children, and the phrase “living with violence”.","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/not-nearly-enough-plea-for-politicians-to-do-more-amid-latest-domestic-violence-tragedy-20181214-p50m8b.html,https://www.academia.edu/1985872/Domestic_Violence_Australian_Public_Policy_with_Suellen_Murray,https://www.whiteribbon.org.au/understand-domestic-violence/what-is-domestic-violence/,http://earlytraumagrief.anu.edu.au/files/ImpactofDVonChildren.pdf,https://www.digital.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/118532/Australian_Institue_of_Criminology-Trends_and_Issues_No195-Yound_Australians_And_Domestic_Violence.pdf,https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/66c7c364-592a-458c-9ab0-f90022e25368/aihw-cws-63.pdf.aspx?inline=true,http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/3235.0~2006~Main+Features~Main+Features?OpenDocument",Do a quarter of all Australian children live with violence?,,,,,,

December 9, 2018.The AnalysisWhen the federal government significantly expanded the medicare-funded treatments available to people suffering eating disorders, support group The Butterfly Foundation welcomed the move, pointing out that eating disorders claimed more lives than any other psychiatric illness. AAP FactCheck has examined the contention that eating disorders are the most deadly psychiatric disorder.Firstly, the term psychiatric disorder is interchangeable with mental disorder. The two key diagnostic reference manuals used by medical professionals in Australia – the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems – both classify eating disorders as mental disorders, and both specifically name anorexia nervosa in this category, among other eating disorders. It’s relevant to note that harmful use of, and dependence upon, psychoactive substances are also classified as mental disorders.In 2014, the results of a meta‐review (or review of systematic reviews) exploring the risks of mortality from major mental disorders were published. The Risks of All‐Cause and Suicide Mortality in Mental Disorders meta-review covered 407 relevant reviews, with data on more than 1.7 million patients and in excess of 250,000 deaths. It concluded: “Those with the highest all‐cause mortality ratios were substance use disorders and anorexia nervosa.”.This followed the results of a 1998 study, Excess Mortality of Mental Disorder, which also found the “highest risks of premature death, from both natural and unnatural causes, are for substance abuse and eating disorders.”In summary, it is AAP FactCheck’s position that while Butterfly Foundation chief executive Christine Morgan’s statement was not misrepresentative, it would have been more accurate to say eating disorders have the “joint highest” mortality rate of any mental disorder.","https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/medicare-move-to-add-psychological-services-funding-for-treatment-of-eating-disorders-welcomed-by-butterfly-foundation/news-story/261283416f1f41d7bc846338a8892a61,https://icd.who.int/browse10/2010/en#/F50-F59,https://icd.who.int/browse10/2010/en#/F10-F19,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20128,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/excess-mortality-of-mental-disorder/45A4F4869523062F276342D48914BB53",Do eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness?,,,,,,

November 29, 2018.The AnalysisIn lobbying for a new $200 on-the-spot fine for pedestrians who are distracted while crossing roads, the Pedestrian Council of Australia (PCA) told news.com.au the road toll costs Australians $30 billion each year.AAP FactCheck examined the figure council president Harold Scruby relied upon as justification for seeking this additional revenue from pedestrians.The road toll is an official tally of road-related fatalities. The Centre for Road Safety – the NSW government agency with responsibility for keeping state road toll statistics – only includes fatal traffic incidents in its road toll, while statistics on non-fatal road trauma are collected separately. A similar methodology is applied in Queensland and other jurisdictions.The most recent, holistic economic analysis of road trauma is not limited to the cost of road fatalities alone. The Cost of Road Trauma in Australia report published in September 2017 was commissioned by the industry group, Australian Automobile Association (AAA), and conducted by Economic Connections (ECON). The analysis was based on 2015 data, and included the cost of road fatalities and all injuries. In the summary of findings, the report says: “ECON finds that for the 2015 calendar year the total cost of road trauma was $29.7 billion”.In its campaign for new pedestrian fines, the PCA has rounded this figure up to the nearest billion.However, a problem arises because Mr Scruby presented this figure as the annual cost of the “road toll” –  implying it related to road fatalities only. It is AAP FactCheck’s position that the $30 billion quoted by Mr Scruby in the news.com.au article is not misleading in itself, but it’s not accurate to frame it as the cost of the “road toll”. Had the figure been attributed to annual road trauma, it would have been correct.The PCA’s further contention that “everyone has to pay for” the cost of the road toll would be understood by readers to be a reference to taxpayers.","https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/on-the-road/calls-for-new-fine-that-would-see-pedestrians-penalised-200/news-story/84058822a7ae95cddf82585c7e26033e,https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/downloads/dynamic/nsw-road-toll-daily.pdf,https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/statistics/serious-injuries.html,https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/road-safety/statistics,https://www.aaa.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AAA-ECON_Cost-of-road-trauma-summary-report_Sep-2017.pdf",Does the road toll cost Australians $30 billion per year?,,,,,,
