""Insulin: Month's supply under DJT, $60. Under Biden, $328,"" said another.The posts, and others like them, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The posts echoed a similar statement from a Senate candidate who claimed Biden had raised the cost of insulin for some of the most vulnerable Americans. PolitiFact rated that Mostly False.That claim hinged on the Biden administration’s decision to freeze the implementation of several federal agency rules that had not gone into effect as of Jan. 20. Among those pending rules was an insulin-related executive order issued by former President Donald Trump in July 2020.But the White House’s decision to temporarily freeze the rule could not have raised the current price of insulin products because the rule had not gone into effect yet. It was set to kick in on Jan. 22, two days after the White House announced its regulatory freeze. The freeze on the insulin-related rule is effective until March 22.Moreover, the Trump rule is narrowly targeted and would not apply to most Americans.The rule would apply to federally qualified health centers, which are government-supported clinics that help people facing financial obstacles to care and prescription drugs. Specifically, it would require those centers to pass along to patients any discounts they get on purchases of insulin and epinephrine through a federal drug pricing program called 340B, rather than pocketing the difference.Supporters of the rule say it would help people who struggle to pay for pricey medications, but the Health and Human Services Department wrote in the Federal Register that it believed the rule would have ""minimal economic impact"" because of its limited scope.""Many FQHCs reported already passing their discount savings onto patients and that the rule would create an administrative burden,"" the American Diabetes Association said in a statement.The National Association of Community Health Centers said in its own statement that ""overall prices of insulin and Epipens across the country are not affected by the Trump Administration regulation or the recent action by the Biden Administration.""Why insulin prices fluctuateRising insulin prices are a problem for the millions of Americans who rely on the medication to manage their diabetes. The high costs have been driven largely by the business practices of manufacturers, health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, PolitiFact reported.PolitiFact messaged the two Facebook posters who said their insulin costs had jumped from $60 to $500 and $328. We did not hear back from either.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021A November report from GoodRx, a company that reports on drug prices, shows wide variation in the retail prices for 27 insulin products across all manufacturers and insulin types.But over time, ""insulin prices are stable,"" said Tori Marsh, director of GoodRx research, who re-crunched the numbers in a chart for PolitiFact. A patient holds a vial of insulin during a news conference outside the Olde Walkersville Pharmacy on July 28, 2019, in Windsor, Ontario, where the medication is far less expensive than across the border in Detroit. (AP)What patients pay for insulin depends on several factors, including the type of insulin product they use and the type of insurance coverage they have, if any. Both insurance plans and drug prices can change year to year.""One possibility for those with insurance coverage is that their plan may have made changes to the insulin products they cover, or changed the preferred status of certain insulins, actions which would increase out-of-pocket costs between one year and another,"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Insulin costs could have also gone up for some patients because their insurance includes a deductible at the start of each new year, Cubanski said. These patients would have to pay full price for their medications until their out-of-pocket costs surpass the deductible.""The January price increases that consumers may have seen were likely because of their deductible resetting,"" Marsh said.These explanations for high prices are ""just the basic facts of how insurance works, not the result of any Biden administration action,"" Cubanski said, adding that Biden has not changed any Trump administration policies affecting insulin beyond the regulatory freeze.For example, a Trump administration policy created a new option under Medicare Part D where drug plans can provide enrollees insulin at a flat monthly copay. It took effect in January, and it hasn’t changed.Our rulingA Facebook post claimed insulin prices rose ""with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.""Individuals who take insulin could have seen prices fluctuate for several reasons related to their insurance coverage and the specific medication they use.

Andrew Cuomo continues to defend his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes following a high-profile independent investigation. Compared to the rest of the country, nursing home deaths linked to the virus are below average, Cuomo said.State Attorney General Letitia James revealed in a report on Jan. 28 that the death toll from the virus among residents of nursing homes had been undercounted in data released by the state Health Department. The report found that the Health Department had reported the overall number of COVID-19 deaths among all state residents accurately.  The administration had said it did not want to double count nursing home residents who died in hospitals. So their deaths in hospitals were not counted as part of the nursing home death toll. The administration has since said the numbers of people transferred from nursing homes to hospitals ""is an important data point."" ""If you look at New York state, we have a lower percentage of deaths in nursing homes than other states,"" Cuomo said during a press briefing on Jan. 29. ""A third of all deaths in this nation are from nursing homes. New York state, we are only at about 28 percent - only. But we’re below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes.""We approached the Cuomo administration for the source of its data. The governor’s staff directed us to a statement from Dr. Howard Zucker, the state’s health commissioner, from Jan. 28. In response to the attorney general’s report, Zucker cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan source of health information.  According to the Health Department, from March 1, 2020, to Jan. 19, 2021, there were 9,786 confirmed deaths of skilled nursing facility residents, including 5,957 in nursing facilities and 3,829 in hospitals. Zucker cautioned that the department’s audit is ongoing, but these figures represent audited data so far. The nursing home residents who died from COVID-19 account for 28 percent of New York’s 34,742 confirmed fatalities, which is below the national average, Zucker said.   Zucker compared KFF data to CDC data to calculate that nationally 35 percent of total deaths affect nursing home residents. Across the country, KFF’s tally is 146,888 long-term care fatalities, as of Jan. 22. This figure includes some nursing home staff members, as well as residents, in the areas of the country where this data is reported. The CDC reported 423,519 total deaths as of Jan. 26, 2021. Adding the number of deaths of nursing home residents who had presumed cases of COVID-19 -- 2,957 -- brings the New York percentage of nursing home deaths to 29.8 percent, still below the national average, Zucker said. We asked a senior policy analyst with KFF about Cuomo’s claim. Priya Chidambaram, who studies COVID-19 in nursing homes, told PolitiFact on Feb. 5 that Cuomo’s claim is consistent with the available data. ""No matter which way you cut it, the New York share does appear to be lower than the national average,"" Chidambaram said.  Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021In October, we fact-checked Cuomo’s claim that New York was ""No. 46 out of 50 states... we're 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes,"" and found it to be Mostly False. That’s because Cuomo was comparing New York to other states while not releasing data about deaths of nursing home residents in hospitals, which would have changed New York’s ranking. KFF also warns that because states report data differently, ""data cannot be compared between states.""  Comparing New York to a national average ""is a more fair reading of where New York ranks,"" Chidambaram said. We also spoke with Robert Applebaum, a gerontology professor who tracks COVID-19 nursing home data at Miami University, which has a partnership with AARP.  ""I would say that our data continued to show that New York state deaths are on average, per hundred, below the national average by a fair amount,"" Applebaum said. People who study the virus in nursing homes warn that data can be incomplete. States have different procedures for collecting and reporting data, such as collecting information about residents and staff, as well as the types of care facilities that are included. The Covid Tracking Project, an independent research initiative, found that as of Jan. 28, the last data release before Cuomo’s statement, 157,069 long-term care residents, including assisted living facilities, and 423,645 people had died of the virus nationwide, presumed and confirmed cases. Long-term care residents represent 37 percent of total deaths in this case. In New York, 25.2 percent of total deaths involved long-term care residents, according to the Covid Tracking Project, though researchers caution that the data could represent an undercount.  A week after Cuomo made his statement, the New York numbers changed significantly. The Cuomo administration released more data, through Feb. 4, about COVID-19-related deaths of people who lived in nursing homes. Presumed and confirmed virus-related deaths total 13,163, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank that sued the administration for nursing home data. On Feb. 5, Cuomo announced overall deaths totaled 35,920, meaning the 36.6 percent of virus deaths were related to nursing homes. The Covid Tracking Project’s national average of deaths of long-term care facility residents, as of Feb. 7, was 36 percent. KFF calculated the national average of long-term care deaths as a percentage of total deaths at 37 percent, as of Feb. 8.    At PolitiFact, we base our rulings on information available at the time the person we are fact-checking made the statement. Our rulingCuomo said that New York’s coronavirus-related death toll of nursing home residents was below the national average. Nationally, long-term care residents account for about 37 percent of COVID-19 deaths, according to KFF. Data from KFF, the federal government and New York state show that New York’s nursing home-related deaths, as a percentage of overall COVID-19 deaths, were below the national average at the time of Cuomo’s claim. Since then, new data about the deaths of all nursing home residents, regardless of where they died, raised the percentage of nursing home residents among the state's COVID-19 fatalities. It is still slightly below the national average calculated by KFF.While his statement is accurate, there are still inconsistencies among the states in how they calculate their nursing home data, and that needs to be taken into account.So we rate Cuomo’s claim Mostly True.","https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-nursinghomesreport.pdf,https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-nursinghomesreport.pdf,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/new-yorks-true-nursing-home-death-toll-cloaked-in-secrecy/2561257/,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-new-york-state-health-commissioner-dr-howard-zucker-1,https://youtu.be/33krNCkmOmk?t=2845,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-new-york-state-health-commissioner-dr-howard-zucker-1,https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions/#longtermcare,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#trends_totalandratedeaths,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/16/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-nursing-home-deaths-not-whole-story/,https://www.aarp.org/ppi/issues/caregiving/info-2020/nursing-home-covid-dashboard.html,https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes-long-term-care-facilities/history,https://covidtracking.com/data/#state-ny,https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-york/long-term-care,http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/covid-19/fatalities_nursing_home_acf.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1OOmTi01TqC7cUwl45V7EvqJ2DI3qTS_6T_ugFfLzwgndjXllP_fwlldY,https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/the-cuomo-administration-releases-more-data/,https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes-long-term-care-facilities,https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions/#longtermcare",,"New York,Coronavirus,Andrew Cuomo",,,,,

Tony Evers “has the authority and revenue necessary” to upgrade the Wisconsin unemployment system without the Legislature.,,politifact,,"Wisconsin’s beleaguered unemployment system is the latest battleground in the ongoing showdown between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-run Legislature.The system continues to stagger beneath the weight of pandemic-driven job losses, with thousands of Wisconsinites forced to wait months for benefits to be processed. Evers and his administration have drawn widespread criticism for the system, which also spurred the governor to effectively fire the head of the state’s workforce development agency.Evers has also leveled blame at Republicans, noting no substantive action was taken to upgrade a system long known to be insufficient during the eight-year stretch where the GOP controlled both the Legislature and governor’s mansion.The governor tried to push the issue forward with a special session on unemployment Jan. 19, but the Legislature convened and adjourned the session within seconds — as they have many other sessions Evers has called in an attempt to initiate action in one of the least active Legislatures in the country.Republicans have said such a step isn’t needed.""It took us all of five minutes to understand that (Evers) has the authority and the revenue necessary to complete this task now,"" Assembly Majority Leaders Jim Steineke said in a Jan. 17, 2021, appearance on WKOW TV’s Capitol City Sunday program. ""He doesn’t need legislative approval. So if he’s just looking for us to put a stamp of approval on, hey governor, you got it, go ahead. The Legislature agrees with you, move forward. You don’t have to wait for us to pass it.""Steineke later said Evers ""has all the flexibility to find the money necessary to complete what he wants to complete on this.""Are Steineke and Republicans right that Evers has both the authority and revenue to address the unemployment system on his own?Let’s take a closer look.The backgroundThe task being debated here isn’t a small one.Evers’ office has estimated an overhaul of the state’s unemployment system would take 10 years to complete and cost $90 million. A Jan. 13, 2021, memo from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the cost at between $48 million and $70 million.This comes as the unemployment system continues to see claims far above historical norms, fueling continued delays in processing payments.This will be the second attempt at such an upgrade, after an effort under Gov. Jim Doyle failed at great taxpayer expense. That unemployment system update was abandoned in 2007 after racking up a tab of $24 million.The Doyle project was funded by technology fees and one-time federal funds, but neither of those is available now. So Evers has said he plans to fund this upgrade through the state’s master lease program.The program, which dates back to 1991, is a way for agencies to finance the cost of IT projects over a number of years when projects are too large to allow lump-sum payment. From 2014 to 2020, $142 million was approved through this program for 28 different IT projects across state government, according to a September 2020 report on the master lease program from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau.State agencies can apply for this funding through the state Department of Administration, which decides whether to approve the applications and then obtains the necessary loans. The Legislature is not involved in the approval process, but it is involved in setting aside money that is used to make those lease payments.More on that in a bit.On Evers’ authority and revenue accessSteineke spokeswoman Alesha Emmert said Evers has the authority to begin the upgrade process by issuing a request for proposal, as his administration has done with many other upgrades without legislative approval.Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, acknowledged the governor has the authority to start the process, but she argued it’s irrelevant without ongoing funding.""Funding a (request for proposal) … is meaningless if there’s no commitment from the Legislature to fund the rest of the project,"" Cudaback said in an email. ""Given the substantial cost for the overall project of $90 million, (Evers’) goal is to ensure funds will be there for the master lease payments in future biennia.""Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on February 16, 2021 in remarks at a CNN town hall""If we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now.”By Louis Jacobson • February 18, 2021Addressing the revenue question, the only specific funding source Emmert identified is a procurement appropriations fund overseen by the Department of Administration that had a $4 million balance at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. But that is far from sufficient in the context of a project that could cost $90 million. And even that fund isn’t accessible, as Emmert asserts.The funds are allocated to the Department of Administration to fund its role procuring items for agencies, not for transferring to other agencies to directly fund purchases, Cudaback said. In addition, the balance is projected to be only $2 million by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.Most notably, that fund was not listed among the potential funding sources in a list compiled by the fiscal bureau. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, asked the agency to identify potential ways to pay for the unemployment upgrades.The resulting memo identified nine funding sources that could be allowable under statute. Seven of those had a balance of $25,000 or less, one had a liability of $85 million and one had a balance around $15 million. That fund, per statute, is to be used for the ""payment of costs associated with program integrity activities,"" and is currently used for fraud investigation, worker classification enforcement, identify verification and criminal prosecutions, among other things.Even if the entirety of that investigation fund were co-opted from its current use, it would fund just a fraction of expected cost.The Legislature’s roleWhatever the mechanism, it’s clear funds will need to be set aside across multiple years. And the way to approve such ongoing funding is through the budget — which must pass the Legislature.The fiscal bureau memo pointed out the need for legislative involvement in the project. In response to a question about whether the Joint Finance Committee could move appropriations from another agency to fund the first payments toward the upgrade (it can), the memo noted this:""If the Committee (did the transfer), it would be incumbent on the Legislature during the budget process to approve monies in subsequent biennia sufficient to fulfill the annual master lease costs over its term.""That Legislative role was echoed in the 2020 audit. It suggested the Legislature consider getting involved in the master lease approval process since it is responsible for appropriating the needed money.""Master lease payments must be made from funds that have been appropriated to state agencies,"" the audit said. ""Therefore, the Legislature could consider modifying statutes to require (the Department of Administration) to obtain its approval before approving applications for master lease funding above a specified amount or for specified projects, such as large, high-risk IT projects.""Steineke’s claim about Evers’ power is particularly unusual since it contradicts his party’s usual view on financial oversight. Republicans argued explicitly against the idea of Evers allocating funding unilaterally in recent days. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos addressed the matter while defending a COVID-19 bill that would give the Republican-controlled finance committee oversight of how federal aid is spent in Wisconsin.""It’s not something that’s all that abnormal,"" Vos, R-Rochester, said on PBS Wisconsin’s Here & Now program Jan. 29, 2021. ""It should mean the Legislature, the ones that are supposed to appropriate money, have the ability to oversee it just like we do with every other dollar that comes into the state treasury.""Our rulingSteineke said Evers ""has the authority and revenue necessary"" to upgrade the state unemployment system without the Legislature.Evers has the authority and funding to begin the process by seeking out proposals, yes. But it’s an empty authority when  no sources under Evers’ control that come close to funding the full project were known at the time of this claim.Steineke’s claim related to revenue simply isn’t true. Both sides acknowledge a master lease would be a logical way forward, and that requires ongoing funding over the course of multiple state budgets — which has to be approved by the Legislature.We define Mostly False as a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.That fits here.  Editor’s note:After Steineke made his statement, a new potential funding option emerged based on a long-unused section of state statute. A state law dating back to at least the 1940s — and unused anytime in recent history — would allow the state to impose a tax of up to 0.2% on all employer payrolls to collect funds needed to administer the state unemployment insurance program. This could be done without any legislative action and theoretically generate more than $60 million per year at its maximum level.However, the existence of this option was not publicly known when Steineke made his claim, and therefore was not part of his claim or the supporting evidence provided by his staff. The state Department of Workforce Development raised this as an option at a Jan. 21 meeting, four days after the statement being rated here. We rate claims based on what is known at the time (that’s one of the Principles of PolitiFact). As such, that does not affect the rating for this item.The story was also updated to clarify that the Wisconsin unemployment system did undergo some upgrades over the last decades, just nothing of substance to address the issues that came to a head amid the pandemic.","https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2021/01/15/unemployment-claims-rise-wisconsinites-wait-answers/6593946002/,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/18/wisconsin-gov-evers-asks-dwd-head-resign-over-unemployment-backlog/5828264002/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/07/facebook-posts/yes-wisconsin-legislators-havent-passed-bill-6-mon/?fbclid=IwAR1w1UvhBWUJrMaeUMgGSQW0VqJyfj_tvXw_TMTyLvhbwOIm2cSlgBgJ4ZQ,https://wkow.com/2021/01/17/capital-city-sunday-securing-the-capitol-corporate-donations-cut-off-ongoing-covid-bill-stalemate/,https://legis.wisconsin.gov/eupdates/asm63/LFB.Memo.Born.pdf,https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/media/3084/20-12full.pdf,/personalities/joe-biden/,/factchecks/2021/feb/18/joe-biden/joe-bidens-town-hall-mistake-about-inflation-index/,https://legis.wisconsin.gov/eupdates/asm63/LFB.Memo.Born.pdf,https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/media/3084/20-12full.pdf,https://pbswisconsin.org/watch/here-and-now/,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/108/19/1,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/1941/statutes/statutes/108.pdf,https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uibola/uiac/materials/2021/20210121modernization.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/",,"Economy,Jobs,Wisconsin,Coronavirus,Jim Steineke",,,,,
5,,,,barely-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/28/scott-walker/walker-overreaches-claiming-senate-cant-convict-tr/,“The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President.”,,politifact,,"Former President Donald Trump is staring down his second impeachment trial in as many years, but uncertainty looms over the unprecedented proceedings.That’s because despite 245 years of history and 21 past impeachments by the U.S. House, the country has no direct precedent for an impeachment trial of a president who has left office.The House impeached Trump Jan. 13, 2021, for his role inciting the Capitol mob on Jan. 6. A trial is set to begin Feb. 8 in the U.S. Senate, but, of course, Trump has since departed the White House, having lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.The resulting procedural question has given rise to an array of claims about what exactly the U.S. Constitution says on the matter, including one from former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.""The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President,"" the longtime Republican politician said in a Facebook post Jan. 26. He then repeated the sentence nine more times for emphasis. Walker also repeated the claim on Twitter, truncated to four repetitions due to the 280-character limit.But if 2020 taught us anything, it’s that saying something over and over on the internet doesn’t make it true.So let’s take a closer look.Arguments on both sidesDespite the confident assertion from Walker — now president of Young America’s Foundation, which seeks to introduce young people to conservative values — this is far from a settled topic.The core Constitutional section here is Article II, Section 4, which says, ""The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" Article I specifies the two potential penalties in play are removal from office and disqualification from holding federal office in the future.Removal is obviously off the table at this point, but disqualification is a highly relevant consequence given Trump is said to be considering a 2024 run for president.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service dove deep into the precedent and constitutional interpretation in a Jan. 15 publication. They summarized their findings this way:""The Constitution does not directly address whether Congress may impeach and try a former President for actions taken while in office,"" the six-page brief said. ""Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.""Some key points the publication lists in support of a trial for a former president:In 1876, the Senate ruled a former secretary of war could face an impeachment trial for actions taken in office even though he had since resigned (more on this in a bit).The U.S. impeachment process was set up with the British system in mind, where former officials could be impeached. The framers made many ""highly specific decisions about the impeachment process that departed from the British practice"" but ""chose not to explicitly rule out impeachment after an official leaves office.""Many scholars have argued simple logic dictates impeachment remain an option. If impeachment didn’t extend to someone no longer in office, any official could elude punishment by simply committing offenses late enough in the term, or by resigning once the impeachment process began. And Congress could never bar an official from holding future office as long as that person resigns first.In the only discussion of the timing of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, most members took it for granted that the President would be impeachable after he left office.Former President John Quincy Adams clearly interpreted this as a non-expiring penalty. While serving as a Congressman after leaving the White House in 1846, he told Congress, ""I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my body, amenable to impeachment by this House for everything I did during the time I held any public office."" Key points against a trial for a former presidentThe plain text of the Constitution, that ""[t]he President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment ... and Conviction,"" could be read literally as only applying to officials who are holding office during impeachment proceedings.U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833) that impeachment doesn’t apply to officials who have left their position because removal is no longer necessary.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Supporting his claim, Walker leaned on the literal interpretation argument.""The (constitutional) language does not refer to a former President,"" Walker said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Furthermore … the language clearly defines the judgement as ‘removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office’ and it does not separate the two issues. The judgement is both, not either or.""We’ll note this and/or argument falls flat, however, as it flies in the face of history. The Senate has convicted and removed eight officials, but it chose to ban only three of them from holding future office. If the two were inextricably tied as Walker suggests, all eight would have been banned.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those who have leaned on the logic argument.""It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or an official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress’ impeachment powers … by simply resigning,"" Schumer, D-New  York, said on the Senate floor on Jan. 26.Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment, told CNN Jan. 24, ""I think it's pretty clear that the effort is constitutional"" based on legal opinions he has reviewed. That viewpoint conflicts with most other Republican senators.John Fortier, a specialist on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact National the problem is that ""the constitutional language is not specific either way."" He noted Schumer and Republican Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, both cited constitutional passages in arguing the two sides.1876 impeachment may provide key precedentHistorical precedent is of particular importance when the Constitution doesn’t specify a course of action, and there is some in this case.The highest-profile suspension of an impeachment process involved President Richard Nixon. No Senate vote was taken because Nixon resigned after an impeachment vote from the House.The remaining possible penalty — a ban from holding federal office — didn’t apply since Nixon had already served two terms, making any Senate action moot. That also makes the situation a poor analogue for the pending Trump impeachment.An 1876 case provides clearer parallels, however.William Belknap, secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, was brought up for impeachment by the House, but he hastily resigned hours before the House voted to impeach him.When the matter moved to the Senate, Belknap argued the Senate had no jurisdiction since by the time the impeachment vote came up he ""was, (and) ever since hath been, and now is, a private citizen.""The Senate disagreed. By a roll-call vote of 37-29, the Senate ruled Belknap was ""amenable to trial by impeachment for acts done as Secretary of War, notwithstanding his resignation of said office before he was impeached.""In the end Belknap was acquitted, with 22 of the senators who supported acquittal saying they did so on the grounds that his resignation barred impeachment. So the Senate conclusion was not unanimous or unambiguous, but it was passed and supported by the majority of the body.Wrapping it upApplying Belknap to the present situation, there’s a case that the argument for trying Trump is even stronger than for Belknap, since Trump was impeached by the House while he was still in office, noted Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University, who wrote a 2001 paper on the subject.But there’s an even simpler argument for this being constitutional: The current Senate said so.In a similar vote to that on Belknap’s objection, the Senate on Jan. 26 voted 55-45 to table an objection from Paul that a trial of a private citizen violates the Constitution. Constitutional matters in this vein are traditionally left to the branches of government to interpret on their own, rather than relying on the courts, the Congressional Research Service says. It described the tradition this way:""The Supreme Court has noted not only that ‘each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution’ when performing their ‘assigned constitutional duties,’ but also that once one branch develops a construction of its own powers, that interpretation ‘is due great respect from the others.’ This principle of developing constitutional meaning outside of the courts is especially applicable in the context of impeachment, where the manner by which the House and Senate exercise their powers has been largely immune from judicial review.""Our rulingWalker said on social media that ""The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President.""There is constitutional ambiguity on this point. That’s something the Democrat-led Senate itself will decide as it steps into new historical territory considering the impeachment of a president after leaving office.But we know at this point in history it’s an overreach to claim this is a settled matter, as Walker does here. If anything, the needle is pointing in the other direction based on the preponderance of legal opinion, Senate precedent and the Jan. 26 vote.We rate this claim Mostly False.","https://history.house.gov/Institution/Impeachment/Impeachment-List/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-impeached.html,https://www.facebook.com/scottkwalker/posts/10165056490070405,https://twitter.com/scottwalker/status/1353843103157936128?s=21,https://www.yaf.org/speakers/scott-walker/,https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii,https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/10/trump-2024-campaign-456692,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10565,https://books.google.com/books?id=fCM8AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA648&lpg=PA648&dq=%E2%80%9CI+hold+myself,+so+long+as+I+have+the+breath+of+life+in+my+body,+amenable+to+impeachment+by+this+House+for+everything+I+did+during+the+time+I+held+any+public+office.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=Cbfj0YHxXy&sig=ACfU3U1iJ3e_LMWBRi9ysK0jsfK1WMfsNQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS0KCOhb3uAhXKPM0KHay-DsoQ6AEwA3oECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CI%20hold%20myself%2C%20so%20long%20as%20I%20have%20the%20breath%20of%20life%20in%20my%20body%2C%20amenable%20to%20impeachment%20by%20this%20House%20for%20everything%20I%20did%20during%20the%20time%20I%20held%20any%20public%20office.%E2%80%9D&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=fCM8AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA648&lpg=PA648&dq=%E2%80%9CI+hold+myself,+so+long+as+I+have+the+breath+of+life+in+my+body,+amenable+to+impeachment+by+this+House+for+everything+I+did+during+the+time+I+held+any+public+office.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=Cbfj0YHxXy&sig=ACfU3U1iJ3e_LMWBRi9ysK0jsfK1WMfsNQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS0KCOhb3uAhXKPM0KHay-DsoQ6AEwA3oECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CI%20hold%20myself%2C%20so%20long%20as%20I%20have%20the%20breath%20of%20life%20in%20my%20body%2C%20amenable%20to%20impeachment%20by%20this%20House%20for%20everything%20I%20did%20during%20the%20time%20I%20held%20any%20public%20office.%E2%80%9D&f=false,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://history.house.gov/Institution/Impeachment/Impeachment-List/,https://www.democrats.senate.gov/news/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-floor-remarks-on-the-need-for-the-impeachment-trial-of-former-president-donald-trump-and-standing-against-sen-pauls-point-of-order,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/24/politics/mitt-romney-trump-impeachment-cnntv/index.html,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jan/26/can-congress-impeach-president-whos-left-office-lo/,https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2032&context=wlr,https://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/facpubs/21/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-challenge-trump-impeachment-trial-11611683182",,"Congress,Wisconsin,Scott Walker",,,,,

Plaintiffs in some lawsuits lacked standing to sue, and some were also riddled with errors. In one case, an affidavit that attempted to cite results from precincts in Michigan cited Minnesota data instead.At least 86 judges — from state courts to the U.S. Supreme Court — have rejected at least one post-election lawsuit filed by Trump or his supporters, according to a review of court filings by the Washington Post, published Dec. 12. Around that time, more than 50 cases had failed or been tossed out of court, the Post found.The Post analysis found that 38 judges appointed by Republicans were among the 86 judges who had rejected lawsuits.

The weekly provisional deaths table doesn’t begin until the week ending Feb. 1, 2020. What’s more, these numbers are continuously updated due to reporting lags, which the CDC says can range from one week to eight weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death. Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram postMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.By Jon Greenberg • January 29, 2021The provisional tally for the year, as of Dec. 11, has already gone up to 2,728,104. Meanwhile, in another report, the CDC estimated that COVID-19 has caused almost 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. from late January through early October. Excess deaths are defined in the report as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. ""Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19,"" the agency reported.Lauren Rossen, a data scientist with CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that the numbers of deaths in 2020 are ""without a question NOT on par with previous years"" and that claims that the numbers are equivalent are based on misinterpretations and misuse of the available data.Since we don’t have all the data for 2020, Rossen said a more accurate analysis would need to involve comparing the number of deaths that occurred in the first 44 weeks, or so, of the year with the number of deaths that occurred over those same weeks in previous years. ""Looking at the number of deaths each year through week 44 (the most recent weeks are incomplete in 2020 due to the length of time it takes to receive and tabulate death certificates), we can see the totals over the same time periods each year.

The person is expected to continue symptom-monitoring and wearing a mask for the full two-week stretch. It sounds like good news, but state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Cedarburg, didn’t seem to take it that way. ""CDC admits old ‘science’ was wrong, says new ‘science’ is only a 7-day quarantine after close contact followed by no symptoms and negative test, 10-day quarantine w/o testing and no symptoms,"" Stroebel tweeted Dec. 3, along with a link to the new information. But it’s actually the senator who is wrong. Here’s why.What spurred the change in guidance?The move came as the CDC acknowledged that a 14-day quarantine is tough on some Americans, particularly those who need to get back to work in-person. Experts say a shorter quarantine may make people more likely to comply with staying home and more willing to work with public health employees to identify their close contacts so transmission can be cut off. It also hones in on the period in which a person would be most capable of passing the virus on if they’d become infected. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s coronavirus response, said people who quit quarantine after seven days carry just about a 5% risk of still passing the virus on, and those who stop after 10 days bear just 1% risk.   So the agency isn’t saying their previous guidance was wrong. In fact, their recommendation to quarantine for 14 days if it’s possible is still in effect. The new guidance simply provides two alternatives for people who are unable to wait. ""Any option to shorten quarantine risks being less effective than the currently recommended 14-day quarantine,"" the guidance states. Why is guidance changing?Like others who have sought to downplay the seriousness of the virus, Stroebel is undermining scientific evidence by criticizing a change in what experts are saying. While it certainly would have saved lives if we knew everything about COVID-19 as soon as it emerged, that’s just not how science works. Featured Fact-checkGordon Hintzstated on February 5, 2021 in TV interview“We know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t.""By Haley BeMiller • February 12, 2021The world had never seen SARS-CoV-2 before early last year, so there’s a lot to learn about it. That means guidelines will change to keep us safest in accordance with what we’re learning. Some examples: Scientists determined early-on that masks help keep you from giving the virus to others. In November, the CDC released a bulletin saying for the first time that they may protect the wearer, too. This change is expected — it signals research progress being made. In July, the World Health Organization announced that the virus may linger in the air in indoor spaces, a form of transmission it had previously called doubtful. Again, new scientific evidence helped bring this revelation to light.Inside hospitals, health care workers discovered that proning, a technique where patients lay on their stomachs to promote better lung expansion, can sometimes alleviate the need to put a patient on a ventilator, which was initially thought to be one of the most critical tools for a seriously ill coronavirus patient. Once again, this was a product of learning more about the virus. This is how scientific research works all over the world. The Ebola virus, for example, was discovered in 1976, and scientists and public health officials were still studying and making changes to their approach when an outbreak arose in West Africa nearly 40 years later. It is extremely likely, if not inevitable, that we’ll still be learning about the novel coronavirus four decades from now, too.In response to an email asking for backup to the senator’s claim, policy director Brian Sikma said Stroebel believes public health recommendations should continue to be revised as more research and data add to our understanding of the virus. ""Because science never stops questioning itself, public health officials and policymakers should be transparent in their recommendations and avoid broad, absolute statements when actual knowledge is still evolving,"" Sikma wrote.That reflects an acknowledgement of the scientific process that Stroebel’s claim did not. But it also provides no evidence of his claim.Our ratingStroebel claimed the CDC admitted it was wrong about its previous recommendation that people who were exposed to the virus should quarantine for 14 days. But they adjusted the guidance because scientists learned more about its contagious period, and because they wanted to make it easier for people to stay home. A 14-day quarantine is still their recommended route, if people can make it work.The CDC guidance remains in place, so it wasn’t ""wrong,"" and there was no admission.We rate Stroebel’s claim False.","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html,https://twitter.com/SenStroebel/status/1334625146808590336,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-quarantine-time-covid/2020/12/02/18159172-349e-11eb-b59c-adb7153d10c2_story.html,/personalities/gordon-hintz/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/gordon-hintz/wisconsin-assembly-minority-leader-right-relations/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/30/michael-schraa/wisconsin-gop-lawmaker-misleads-claim-masks-are-in/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/27/ventilator-alternatives-show-promise-ease-shortage-fears-coronavirus-covid-19-wisconsin-milwaukee/3005262001/,https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/summaries.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvhf%2Febola%2Foutbreaks%2Fhistory%2Fsummaries.html",,"Public Health,Science,Wisconsin,Coronavirus,Duey Stroebel",,,,,

This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!"" Trump tweeted, referring to a federal judge’s determination that Democrats had orchestrated a ""massive scheme"" involving absentee ballots to win a pivotal 1993 race. The judge later removed the Democratic candidate from office and installed his Republican challenger. But nothing like what happened nearly three decades ago occurred during the 2020 election in Philadelphia or anywhere else. In fact, none of the lawsuits the Trump campaign filed in Pennsylvania after the Nov. 3 election contains even one allegation — let alone evidence — of a single vote being cast illegally because of absentee-ballot fraud. So what happened in 1993? Pennsylvania held a special election to replace a Democratic state senator from North Philadelphia who died in office. Most of the voters in the area he represented were registered Democrats, but turnout in previous elections had been low, and the balance of power in the state Senate was on the line. Whichever party won the special election was poised to capture a majority in the upper house. To ensure that Democrat William Stinson would win, three Philadelphia election officials illegally delivered hundreds of absentee ballot packets to Stinson’s campaign. Staffers then distributed the packets to voters who didn’t qualify at the time to vote absentee, instructed them in some cases to vote for Stinson, and delivered the ballots to the Board of Elections.The case wound up in federal court after state election officials and state courts rejected Republicans’ claims about impropriety.  ""Stinson knew of and ratified the procedures, and the board participated in and later tried to conceal its involvement in the scheme,"" U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer said at the time. In February 1994, Newcomer took the unprecedented step of invalidating all 1,757 absentee ballots cast in the election. Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021Back then, voters were allowed to request absentee ballots only if they were too sick to vote in person or planned to be out of the city on election day. Newcomer heard testimony from dozens of voters who said the Stinson campaign led them to believe the law had changed and they were now allowed to vote from home just for convenience. In dozens of other cases, the campaign simply forged the signature of voters. In the end, Newcomer ordered that Stinson, a then 49-year-old former assistant deputy mayor of Philadelphia, be removed from office and that Republican Bruce Marks, a then 36-year-old lawyer and former aide to U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, replace him. ""This is extraordinary relief,"" Newcomer wrote in February 1994. ""However, it is appropriate because extraordinary conduct by the Stinson campaign and the board tainted the entirety of the absentee ballots.""The following month, The Philadelphia Inquirer published an exhaustive examination of the absentee ballots cast in the Stinson-Marks contest and revealed that 540 absentee ballots, nearly a third of the total, were tainted by some form of improper conduct, including voters’ signatures being forged, ballots cast in the names of dead or out-of-district voters, and campaign workers marking ballots themselves. The race was close enough to turn the loss into a win for the Democrats.The 2020 presidential election and this 1993 state Senate special election differ in several key ways. Campaigns are still barred from distributing absentee ballots to voters, but Pennsylvania now allows residents to vote by mail without giving a reason — the very conduct that was barred during the 1993 special election. And critically, unlike the Marks campaign, which sought relief for specific allegations of voter fraud, the Trump campaign has not alleged in court that any mail ballots were intentionally cast illegally. Rather, the campaign has been seeking to disqualify ballots submitted by lawful voters based on claims about counting procedures and other rules. Our ruling Trump tweeted that a 1993 example of voter fraud in Philadelphia is ""exactly what happened to us"" in the 2020 election. It is not, and there is no evidence the Trump campaign is making that argument in court. The 1993 case at the heart of Trump’s tweet involved a rare, verified case of voter fraud. The Trump campaign has not alleged a specific case of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and there is no evidence of any. Trump’s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.","https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327438487537246210?s=20,https://www.inquirer.com/news/trump-lawsuits-pennsylvania-election-results-supreme-court-federal-judge-20201116.html,/personalities/tom-wolf/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/",,"National,Elections,Pennsylvania,Donald Trump",,,,,

Let’s take a look.The claimWhen asked to back up the claim, Courtney Beyer, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Democratic Party of Wisconsin, cited a Oct. 28, 2020, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that reported 23,196 absentee ballots were rejected in the April 2020 election, about 1.8% of total ballots. Democrats believe there are signs it would be much lower for the November election.""At least 23,000 ballots were rejected in April,"" Beyer said in an email.  ""We don’t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won’t for a while), but preliminary counts had it around 1,000. Significantly less.""Beyer also cited a Nov. 3  tweet from WisPolitics.com journalist Pat Poblete, who said ""Administrator Meagan Wolfe says as of this afternoon, 970 absentee ballots have been returned with a deficiency that would lead to them being rejected.""But Wikler’s claim was made while discussing the Nov. 3 election. Viewers would have had no reason to believe he was referencing data from the April primary.

In other words, it doesn’t give any general insight on how often ballots were rejected overall.However, there is an indication that the number of rejected absentee ballots could drop. The Oct. 28 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article points out that in April 2016, 5,860 absentee ballots were rejected — 2.5% of the total absentee ballots.And in April 2020, 23,196  absentee ballots were rejected.

By looking at the 2016 rejected ballot rate compared with the improved April 2020 rate, there is a possibility the rejection will also be down for November 2020, but there is no data yet to confirm that.Even Democrats subsequently acknowledged, ""We don’t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won’t for a while).""For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.","https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-dems-boosted-turnout/34608005,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/28/most-rejected-wisconsin-april-absentee-ballots-missing-witness-info/3749887001/,https://twitter.com/bypatpoblete/status/1323767087702167554?s=21,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/28/most-rejected-wisconsin-april-absentee-ballots-missing-witness-info/3749887001/",,"National,Elections,States,Wisconsin,Ben Wikler",,,,,

Other municipalities in the state count absentee ballots at the precinct level, so they are tallied along with in-person votes. The late boost for Biden from Milwaukee was expected, especially because mail-in ballots tend to skew toward Democrats and Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold. After Milwaukee reported those returns, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by about 8,000 votes. His lead widened to around 20,000 after Green Bay reported in-person and absentee results and Kenosha finished its tally.So, two things: Biden was never up by 100,000 votes, and he will certainly not win Wisconsin by that much. It’s also ridiculous to suggest Wisconsin election officials ""took a break"" when they spent all night processing ballots. A delay in results does not mean the counting process stopped. What’s more, people were permitted to observe the counting of absentee ballots in Wisconsin;  and Green Bay and Milwaukee even live-streamed the process online. ""I think that it’s insulting for local election officials to say yesterday’s election was anything but an incredible success that was the result of years of preparation and meticulously, carefully following the law,"" Meagan Wolfe, the commission’s director, said in a news conference the morning after the election.The Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment. Our rulingA viral Facebook post cites a tweet that claimed, ""Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k.""The Democratic nominee never held that great of a lead in Wisconsin, even when the Associated Press called the race.

Trump ended that theft.”",,politifact,,"A viral Facebook post claims that former President Barack Obama’s health insurance law penalized a family a large amount of money for not buying health insurance and that President Donald Trump was responsible for stopping the practice.The post features writing on the back of a car windshield that says, ""Because our family couldn’t afford health insurance, Obama/Biden penalized us about $10,000, then took that $10,000 and used it to pay for others’ free Obamacare. Trump ended that theft.""The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with Facebook.) We found a similar post on Instagram.The post appears to refer to the individual mandate penalty, a tax under the Affordable Care Act placed on those who chose not to get health insurance. At the end of 2017, Republican-backed tax legislation, also supported by Trump, zeroed out the fine. Beginning in 2019, people could no longer be penalized for not having health insurance. Thus, the mandate hasn’t been in effect for about two years.But $10,000 — the hefty amount this family was supposedly penalized for not having health insurance — raised questions for us. And was that money really used to pay for other people’s health insurance? We decided to look into it.The history of the individual mandateThe ACA was implemented in 2010 during the Obama administration. The aim of the health care law — often referred to as Obamacare — was to ensure everyone had health insurance.To that end, the law used what health policy experts call a ""carrot-and-stick"" approach. For low-income and middle-income individuals who had difficulty affording health insurance, the government would provide tax subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance — that was the carrot. And to make sure everyone enrolled in a health insurance plan, those who didn’t sign up were fined, under what was known as the individual mandate provision. That was the stick.The individual mandate, which didn’t kick in until 2014, was unpopular with the American public, according to polling at the time. A 2017 KFF poll showed that 55% of Americans supported the idea of eliminating the requirement that everyone must have health insurance or pay a fine. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)Although one of Trump’s key campaign promises was to repeal and replace the ACA, efforts to do so failed in 2017 when the Republican-held Senate failed to get the votes it needed.Instead, in their 2017 tax bill, Republicans set the penalty for the individual mandate to $0. Starting in 2019, Americans no longer had to pay a fine for not having health insurance. Trump signed the 2017 tax bill into law. So, it is true that Trump and congressional Republicans were responsible for neutralizing the penalty.However, experts pointed out that the individual mandate is still in place, it’s just that the penalty is set to $0. In fact, the end of the penalty is behind the justification for a court case attempting to overturn the ACA, brought by Republican attorneys general and supported by the Trump administration. The plaintiffs argue that the health care law is no longer constitutional because the penalty no longer ""produces at least some revenue"" for the federal government. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the case Nov. 10.The mathThe viral social media posts claim that the family ""couldn’t afford health insurance"" and was penalized $10,000.Health policy experts told us that while the social media post doesn’t give all the specifics needed to know if this was absolutely true, it seems unlikely a penalty would be this high.One issue is the post doesn’t specify whether the $10,000 penalty was incurred in one year or over multiple years. It also doesn’t say how many individuals were part of the family.Assuming the $10,000 penalty was incurred in one year, multiple experts told us that the family would have had an annual income above $400,000 and at least one person would have had to be uninsured for the entire year. That math is based on the penalty structure in place in 2018, the last year the mandate was enforced.In 2018, the penalty was calculated one of two ways. The fine was the greater of the two results:Featured Fact-checkBuck Sextonstated on February 8, 2021 in a blog item posted on FacebookThe science says “open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives.""By Victoria Knight • February 19, 2021$695 for an adult and $347.50 for a child, up to a max of $2,085 per family annually, or2.5% of family income above a certain tax filing threshold (KFF estimated the tax filing threshold was $10,650 for a single individual or $21,300 for joint filers in 2018).The first way to calculate the penalty obviously doesn’t apply since the max was $2,085 per year. So, the second would be the only way to get a $10,000-a-year penalty. To arrive at such a number, you would have to take 2.5% of the family’s income. In this case, 2.5% of a $400,000 income gets you close to $10,000.And experts said it is highly unlikely that a family with a $400,000 income would have had difficulty affording health insurance.""So I would highly doubt the veracity of what is written on that car windshield,"" Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow in health reform and private insurance at KFF wrote in an email. ""People with that much income almost always have job-based health benefits and, if not, generally are inclined to insure themselves very well in order to protect assets — otherwise, if hospitalized and uninsured, they could owe many multiples of the penalty amount in medical bills.""Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also pointed out that a $10,000 penalty would have been rare.""Very few American families would have paid anything close to that amount in penalty for not having insurance — the average penalty per person in 2017 was around $700,"" Oberlander wrote in an email. ""Moreover, only a small percentage of Americans ever paid the penalty for not having health insurance — in 2017, 4.6 million persons,"" or about 1% of the population. (In 2017, 325 million people lived in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.)It’s also unclear whether it would have just been cheaper for the family to pay for health insurance rather than incur a $10,000 penalty, said Matthew Fiedler, a health policy scholar at the Brookings Institution.""It depends on the ages of the members of the family, where they live, what year (or years) we are talking about, and the family’s income,"" Fiedler wrote in an email. ""There are conceivable scenarios where the family could have found a bronze plan for $10k or less. But there are also plenty of plausible scenarios where they could not have. Without knowing more about the family’s circumstances, it’s just hard to say with any confidence.""Where did the penalty money go?Experts also told us that the post’s assertion that the penalties paid for not having health insurance were directly applied to fund other people’s health insurance was off the mark.The individual mandate penalties were assessed during each annual tax filing, and then payments were made the year after there was a lapse in insurance coverage.Those penalties were collected just like any other tax payment.""As a strict accounting, keep in mind, everything gets dumped into the Treasury regardless of the source, and then it is appropriated out of the Treasury by Congress,"" said Edmund Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health care policy at the Heritage Foundation. ""It’s not like money goes into one account and then another.""So, while it’s certainly possible that the penalty money could have been used to help pay for some of the ACA subsidies for other people, the money also could have gone to any other number of things the government pays for, like the military, disaster relief or education.""You don’t know exactly where your taxes or penalties go,"" said Evan Saltzman, an assistant professor in economics at Emory University. ""Maybe a small share went to Obamacare, but that’s a stretch. You can’t track where every dollar you spent on your taxes is going.""It’s also misleading to say that other individuals received ""free Obamacare"" from the penalty payment. The experts said that while Medicaid expansion, which was a part of the ACA, does provide health care coverage for low-income people who are eligible, those who bought insurance on the marketplace would still likely have paid for some part of their coverage after subsidies were applied.Our rulingA viral social media post claims that a family was penalized $10,000 for not being able to afford health insurance. It also claimed the penalty money was taken to pay for others’ ""free ObamaCare"" and Trump stopped that practice.It is true that Trump and Congress did zero out the individual mandate requirement, so people could no longer be penalized for not having health insurance. But after that, skepticism abounds.For instance, it’s very unlikely that a family would face a $10,000 penalty in one year. Moreover, if such a family did face this penalty for not having health insurance, they would likely be in a high-income bracket for which health insurance tends to come from an employer or be affordable. And the charge that the penalty was used to provide ""free coverage"" for others doesn’t fit with federal accounting processes.Experts said, though, that the lack of specifics about this family’s situation makes it difficult to be completely definitive.We rate this claim Mostly False.","https://www.facebook.com/Capitalists/photos/a.226491315514/10164464788875515,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2018/jul/eliminating-individual-mandate-penalty-behavioral-factors,https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2018/jul/eliminating-individual-mandate-penalty-behavioral-factors,https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-november-2017-the-role-of-health-care-in-the-republican-tax-plan/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1388/repeal-obamacare/,https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text,https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-california-v-texas-a-guide-to-the-case-challenging-the-aca/,https://affordablecareactlitigation.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fifth-circuit-opinion-technical-revisions-12-20.pdf,https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/aca-individual-shared-responsibility-provision-calculating-the-payment,/personalities/buck-sexton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/buck-sexton/conservative-talk-show-host-falsely-claims-science/,https://www.kff.org/interactive/penalty-calculator/,https://www.kff.org/person/karen-pollitz/,https://www.med.unc.edu/socialmed/directory/jonathan-oberlander/,https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219,https://www.brookings.edu/experts/matthew-fiedler/,https://www.heritage.org/staff/edmund-haislmaier,http://economics.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/biography/saltzman-evan.html",,"Health Check,Facebook posts",,,,,

Some Border Patrol stations were so overcrowded that agents used other areas, including warehouses, to hold migrants. Border Patrol used chain-link fencing to separate different groups, as documented in photos from that time period.""We needed to have places like the one we set up temporarily in Arizona to house the kids until they could be placed with (Health and Human Services),"" said Jeh Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary during the Obama administration, in a July 2019 interview.

""That's what Joe Biden's tax increase means for you.""The ad ran on TV as recently as Oct. 21. It resembles a similar spot released Sept. 16, which also cut Biden’s South Carolina remarks out of context and made claims about his tax plan. But Biden and his campaign have been clear throughout the campaign that he intends to focus any direct tax increases on the wealthiest people and corporations.Biden has repeatedly pledged to avoid raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 per year. Independent tax analysts who assessed Biden’s plan in the spring and summer of 2020 agreed that it does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold.Some lower earners could see small hits to their after-tax incomes due to the indirect effects of Biden’s proposed increase to the corporate tax rate, the early tax analyses said. But the highest earners and corporations would be hit hardest under Biden’s proposals, which include:Increasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.Raising the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%.Placing a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000.Taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.Several of the same tax groups have since updated their analyses to incorporate a number of tax credits Biden has proposed that would target middle-class and lower earners. The updated reports from the Tax Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Tax Policy Center and Penn Wharton Budget Model show Biden’s plan bringing in smaller overall tax revenues, because of the tax credits, than original estimates assumed. The updated analyses also show the tax credits offsetting the indirect effects facing lower earners as a result of the increased corporate tax rate in the first year under Biden’s plan. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.The Trump ad distorts what Biden was sayingHere’s a look at how the ad presents Biden’s words out of context:Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021How the ad quotes Biden: ""If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.""The missing context: This quote is from a Feb. 27 campaign event in Conway, South Carolina. The Trump campaign ad gives the misleading impression that Biden told the crowd he plans on raising taxes on all Americans if elected president. But that’s not what he said.The full context shows Biden was addressing one person who indicated moments earlier that he or she had benefited from the tax bill that became law under Trump. The ad cuts out the part of the clip where Biden specified that taxes would be raised ""if you benefited from that.""""Well, you did. Well that’s good. I’m glad to see you’re doing well already,"" Biden said, directly addressing that person in the audience. ""But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.""How the ad quotes Biden: ""And here’s how it works. I’m going to raise taxes.""The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 10 campaign event in Erie, Pa. The Trump campaign ad cuts Biden’s remarks short, leaving out the ensuing lines in which Biden specified that his tax plan would only raise taxes for corporations and the highest earners.The full context shows Biden was talking about his plan to spur job growth and an economic recovery from the recession brought on by the pandemic.""And here’s how it works. I’m going to raise taxes,"" Biden said. ""I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand. But you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay their fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay.""How the ad quotes Biden: ""You’re going to get a tax raise.""The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 12 campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. The Trump campaign ad again omits key portions of Biden’s remarks. The full context shows he was talking about raising taxes on people with taxable incomes over $400,000 per year.""I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year,"" Biden said. ""If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you’re going to get a tax raise. Well, I’m going to raise your tax slightly, if you’re making over 400. But look, you’re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle-class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most. Raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I’m going to raise back the tax cut he gave for corporate America.""Our rulingA Trump campaign ad claims Biden repeatedly told Americans he's going to raise their taxes. That’s not what Biden actually said in the three clips highlighted in the ad, which were edited to pluck specific comments out of context.

Caleb Rowden is trying his best to keep Missouri’s 19th District red with campaign ads stretched across social media touting his efforts in office. Rowden and his opponent, Democrat Judy Baker, have stressed public education, which has been historically underfunded by the state.A recent Facebook ad by Rowden’s campaign asks users to ""like"" his page ""to help re-elect State Senator Caleb Rowden who fully funded Missouri K-12 education for the first time in state history."" What does it mean to ""fully fund"" public education? And does Rowden deserve credit?A foundation to build uponMissouri’s K-12 education is funded by a mix of local, state, and federal sources, with state sources accounting for about 40% of the total funds each year, according to the Missouri Budget Project. For decades, Missouri has been using what is called the foundation formula to determine the level of state funding for each of the more than 500 school districts in the state. This in turn provides a state funding target each fiscal year. According to the State & Regional Fiscal Studies Unit at the University of Missouri, the foundation formula has gone through many revisions due to changing economic circumstances, court rulings, and modifications in how real and personal property is taxed in the state. When the 1993 formula was deemed obsolete, a new foundation formula was adopted on July 1, 2006. It determines each district’s state aid by multiplying the weighted average daily attendance, which accounts for low-income, special education, and limited English proficiency students, by that of the minimum amount that will be spent on students in all districts to ensure all students receive an adequate education. That number is then adjusted based on local funding and local cost of living.Kim Rueben, director of the State and Local Finance Initiative at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us that the legislature has to meet the total dollar amount determined by the formula for K-12 education to be considered fully funded.""It isn't necessarily uncommon for formulas or guarantees not to be fully funded,"" Rueben said. The current formula wasn’t fully funded until 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year.

But the senator, who was sworn into office three months earlier, was among the 19 ""yeas"" to add $45 million and bring public education funding to a total of $3.4 billion, matching the formula’s yearly funding target. We wondered whether previous formulas had been fully funded. So we asked someone who helped draft the prior formula in 1993, Otto Fajen, the legislative director at the Missouri National Education Association. ""There has been multiple, sustained years of a fully funded K-12 education formula, as it stood under law at that time, throughout the ‘90s,"" Fajen said. The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education provided us with a table that proves K-12 education was fully funded for the fiscal years 1994 through 2001.Our rulingRowden said he ""fully funded Missouri K-12 education for the first time in state history."" He voted to approve a 2017 budget amendment to fully fund K-12.

And for only the second time in history, forecasters in 2020 used up all 21 of the year’s Atlantic storm names and had to resort to Greek letters. On the numerical comparison, Pence has a point. Hurricanes that reach U.S. land are happening about as often as they did 100 years ago.But that isn’t all the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other scientists have to say about hurricanes and climate change.Focusing only on the number of storms obscures warnings from NOAA and other scientists about the effect of climate change on future storms. ""If we are thinking about what to expect in the coming century, it’s not just a matter of extrapolating what we saw in the past century,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a former NOAA scientist who is now a Princeton University professor.Scientists are more concerned about the intensity of future storms.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Phil Klotzbach, a scientist at Colorado State University, said scientists are continuing to disentangle questions about climate change and hurricanes. But it’s clear that skyrocketing population growth along the coast means storms today are more costly and destructive than 100 years ago, and sea level rise means more dangerous flooding from storm surge. What to know about hurricane numbersPence didn’t specify whether he was referring to hurricanes that made landfall around the world, or just in the U.S. (The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification.) The most reliable data is for U.S. landfalling hurricanes, so we’ll start there. Jeff Masters, meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said it is true that the number of U.S. mainland landfalling Atlantic hurricanes has not changed appreciably in the past 100 years. There was one year about a century ago, in 1916, when nine tropical storms or hurricanes hit the mainland U.S. With Hurricane Delta, 10 have hit the U.S. this year.""We are cruising through names at a record pace, but largely thanks to a lot of weak and/or short-lived ones,"" said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami hurricane researcher. ""This is in stark contrast to the 2005 season, which also went into the Greek alphabet for the first time but produced many long-lived and very intense hurricanes.""This year’s busy season doesn’t necessarily mean we should expect more storms.""Computer modeling results of Atlantic hurricanes are inconclusive on whether or not climate change will cause an increase or decrease in the number of Atlantic hurricanes in a future warmer climate, with some models showing a decrease, and some showing an increase,"" Masters said. ""But what theory and modeling do agree upon is that we will see the strongest hurricanes get stronger. Observations suggest that we are already seeing that occur.""Masters pointed to a June 2020 research article by scientists at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that looked at global storms from 1979 to 2017. The number of major hurricanes — Category 3 or stronger — increased globally by 15% in the later half of that period.Major hurricanes are significantly more damaging than a Category 1 or 2 storm. A September NOAA research analysis concluded that future hurricanes will be more intense with higher rainfall rates as a result of global warming. NOAA has said that rising sea levels, another effect of climate change, will increase the threat of storm-surge flooding during hurricanes.RELATED: Can a nuclear bomb stop a hurricane?

The Biden campaign didn’t reply to our questions seeking clarification.Obama’s clemency actions were a fraction of what Biden saidArticle II, Section 2, of the Constitution says the president ""shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."" The general term for these presidential actions is clemency, but there are two types. A pardon, described as an ""expression of the President’s forgiveness,"" is issued after a person’s conviction or after a person’s sentence has been completed. It restores rights, such as the right to vote or run for office. A commutation reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, but it does not remove the conviction.Over his two terms, Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, for a total of 1,927 acts of clemency, according to federal Department of Justice data. The Biden campaign said he misspoke and meant to say about 1,800, but instead said 18,000. Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Trump has taken 38 clemency actions during his nearly four years in office, according to data through Sept. 8.Experts previously told us that Obama followed a policy of clemency actions aimed at low-level criminals who were given long sentences many years ago, and he followed recommendations made by the Justice Department. Trump has largely acted on his own based on recommendations from friends, celebrities, media personalities and business colleagues.In July, the White House announced that Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone on charges stemming from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. Trump’s announcement occurred days before Stone was set to begin a 40-month prison sentence.In announcing Trump’s clemency actions in February, the White House cited the election of Edward DeBartolo Jr. to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as an NFL team owner and his charitable contributions; called Michael Milken one of America’s greatest financiers and noted his philanthropic work; and praised former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for tutoring and mentoring fellow prisoners. (You can read more about their crimes here.)Trump has taken some steps toward criminal justice reform.

That’s basically saying, do you know what that is? There’ll be no more oil, there’ll be no more gas, there’ll be no more nothing, there’ll be no more industry, there’ll be no more country. That’s what it’s saying really. And that would instantly shut down fracking and mining immediately in Pennsylvania, sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you."" We wondered whether the president accurately characterized Biden’s net-zero emissions plan. Trump is right that Biden wants to shift toward clean energy, but he’s got the timeline wrong. Biden wants the country to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels over the next 15 years, not right away like Trump said. Net-zero emissions is what scientists and many world leaders agree is needed to stop climate change from spiraling out of control. The term describes the process of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and then offsetting what can’t be eliminated through activities like forest restoration. In July, Biden released a sweeping $2 trillion plan to tackle climate change that he said would set the United States on ""an irreversible path"" to net-zero emissions by 2050. Twenty countries and regions around the world have adopted similar targets. To achieve that goal, Biden wants to create a pollution-free power sector by 2035; increase energy efficiency by upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes; and shift major cities toward public transportation. The first plank in that plan, creating a pollution-free power sector by 2035, would require phasing out coal in western Pennsylvania over the next 15 years. The plan does not, however, call for ending hydraulic fracturing — the controversial drilling technique known as fracking — instantly, or at all. Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021We’ve examined Biden’s position on fracking several times now, so we know he hasn’t called for banning the practice. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land, but would allow existing fracking operations to continue. The Biden campaign has also noted previously that 90% of fracking today takes place on private land. Biden’s position on fracking became muddled earlier this year when he misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, who was then his last opponent standing in the Democratic primary.Here’s an excerpt of their exchange:""I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,"" Sanders said. ""I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts, and maybes about it.""""So am I,"" Biden replied.""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said.""No more — no new fracking,"" Biden said.Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking — a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president’s opponents pounced.Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden’s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, the Washington Post reported. The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets or the Trump campaign from inaccurately claiming that Biden supports a total ban on fracking.Our ruling Trump said Biden’s net-zero emissions plan would shut down the fracking and coal mining industries ""instantly"" and ""immediately.""

""We had asked for donations from 200 corporations, and none of them came through.""Before the event, the New York Times reported that Trump was given the honor of serving as grand marshal for the event in exchange for his contributions, and put the total cost of the parade at about $2.4 million.

32,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/14/joe-biden/joe-bidens-offshoring-attack-donald-trump-needs-co/,Says Donald Trump “let federal contractors double offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office.”,,politifact,,"In a Labor Day event, Joe Biden told workers that President Donald Trump’s claims about supporting the average person aren’t supported by the facts.""He gave big tax cuts to corporations without making them bring jobs home,"" the Democratic nominee said Sept. 7. ""He let federal contractors double offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office.""That last part about offshoring — when companies move jobs overseas to save money — caught our ear. As we drilled down, we found that the numbers behind Biden’s statement are reasonably correct, but the underlying government data aren’t robust enough for firm conclusions.The report behind Biden’s wordsThe Biden campaign relied on a report from the labor-backed project Good Jobs Nation, which is part of a group called Change to Win. The report looked at companies that won government contracts between the time Trump won the election and the first week of June 2018. The first thing to note is the period included about three months before Trump took office, which isn’t what Biden said.The report then looked at companies with workers who were at risk of losing their jobs because the company planned to move work overseas.That second list comes from the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program, an effort that’s been around for about six decades to help workers displaced by foreign trade. When someone loses their job, they can apply for retraining and financial assistance to move into a new job.The Good Jobs Nation report took the top 100 government contractors — which included companies such as Boeing, General Motors, Siemens and United Technologies — and counted up the number of jobs that appeared under their names in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The study included jobs at risk due to production shifting overseas.The report found that collectively, these firms accounted for 8,363 lost jobs per year. In contrast, the average rate was 3,100 during the Obama administration. The Trump rate is about two and a half times higher, so that’s the basis for Biden’s statement.To be clear, the report had a narrow focus. The report’s author, George Faraday, a lawyer and policy analyst with Change to Win, said it was written in response to Trump’s signature effort in 2016, before he took office, to stop the air conditioning company Carrier Corp. from sending jobs to Mexico. (We rated that a Promise Kept.) ""Our point was that Carrier was a one-off and there was no serious follow up,"" said Faraday. ""The administration was willing to award these companies contracts worth billions of dollars from taxpayers, with no expectation that they would invest in the country.""Faraday said he never updated the study beyond the June 2018 cutoff point.Checking the underlying numbersIt’s important to understand what the trade adjustment job numbers mean, and where the report’s numbers aren’t as precise as they appear. For example, it says Boeing Co. was awarded over $29 billion in contracts, and had 2,681 jobs show up in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. In fact, the government ultimately found that over 5,275 jobs were threatened. We found a few instances where the Good Jobs Nation report overshot the government figures by a few hundred jobs. On balance, the numbers we found indicated that the thrust of the report’s findings holds up, even if the numbers are off at certain points.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021It’s worth noting that the government numbers don’t necessarily count people who lost their jobs. The estimates include actual separations, people whom the company thinks it might need to lay off and workers who might see their hours and wages cut back. And it also counts contract workers, which in Boeing’s case involves a large number of firms that provide Boeing with workers who have special skills.A question of timingEven if the numbers in the report check out, it’s reasonable to scrutinize the findings a little more.We looked at whether total U.S. employment at some of the largest firms rose or fell during the period the report covers. We were able to get hard numbers only from Boeing. Between 2016 and 2017, the company shed about 9,000 jobs.The comparison isn’t perfect. The figure doesn’t include contract workers, and the time period doesn’t align perfectly with the 18 months in the Good Jobs Nation study. But the decline suggests the report spotted a real trend.On the other hand, what happened at Boeing in 2018 and 2019 points to the biggest limitation in Biden’s claim — it considers a narrow time frame.The Boeing press office told us that the number of workers rose over the next two years, and by 2019, the total was 5,000 higher than in 2016. It’s also worth noting that Biden spoke only about federal contractors and jobs sent out of the country. Looking at all companies and jobs affected by trade — which includes jobs lost when production shifts to outside U.S. borders, but also when imports displace domestic production — the average number of displaced workers is lower during the Trump years than during Obama’s second term. The difference is about 4,000 jobs, or a decline of about 5%.Reshoring jobs: Beware of simple talking pointsThe flip side of offshoring is reshoring, or bringing overseas jobs back to the U.S. The data on that is limited.The Reshoring Initiative, a project of a private business consultant Harry Moser, tracks press releases and news reports to count jobs brought back to the U.S. That’s a bit informal, but in any case, Moser said Trump’s record is mixed, largely due to his policy of imposing tariffs.""Reshoring grew solidly thru 2015, soared in 2016 when Trump was elected, accelerated higher in 2017 with lower taxes and regulations, then declined in 2018 and 2019, primarily due to business uncertainty from the trade war,"" Moser said.But the bottom line is that claims about both sending jobs overseas and bringing them home should not be taken at face value.Our rulingBiden said that in his first 18 months in office, Trump allowed government contractors to offshore jobs at twice the rate as before.Biden accurately quoted a report, and its findings are reasonably accurate. But the report’s job count actually began before Trump took office, and the government’s tallies include jobs that are at risk, not necessarily ones that are lost. That way of counting jobs, however, would apply equally to the Trump and Obama years.There’s a measure of accuracy in Biden’s statement, but it requires more context.We rate this claim Half True.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-afl-cio-virtual-event-transcript-september-7,http://goodjobsnation.org/content/uploads/2018/08/Broken-Promises2.pdf,https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/tradeact/data,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1415/save-carrier-plant-indiana/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.doleta.gov/tradeact/petitioners/taadecision.cfm?taw=92903,https://reshorenow.org/",,"National,Jobs,Joe Biden",,,,,

(Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)We focused on a Facebook post that was viewed 1.2 million times in less than 24 hours after it was published Tuesday afternoon. Similar posts were viewed and shared thousands of times.""PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA. Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender. This is unbelievable California!""Prominent public figures from state Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove to former San Francisco Giants baseball player Aubrey Huff to some Democratic state lawmakers have spoken out against the bill, though their statements do not go so far as to describe the bill as legalizing sex with minors.With so many claims swirling, we decided to check the facts. The Facts About SB 145Current state allows a judge to decide whether to place a young man convicted of statutory rape, in which vaginal intercourse takes place with a minor, on the sex offender registry based on the facts of the case. There is no such discretion when the offense includes anal or oral sex. SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex-offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision, as with cases involving vaginal intercourse. The law would not apply in cases where a one party does not believe the sexual contact was voluntary.LGBTQ advocates, including the bill’s author state Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco), say it would do away with a discriminatory law, one that’s a relic of a penal code that criminalized those acts until 1975, even between consenting adults. ""This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth,"" Wiener said in a fact sheet on the law produced by his office, Equality California and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, all of which support the bill. ""SB 145 ends this irrational distinction by treating all sex the same way that the law currently treats penile-vaginal intercourse.""Decades ago, police used the fact that certain sex acts were illegal to raid gay clubs and charge people with crimes, said Asm. Sydney Kamlager, D-Los Angeles, a supporter of the bill, during a press conference last month.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Kamlager said the disparity in the law was ""put in place during a more conservative time in California and historically these [police raids] were done systematically to target folks to remove people who identified as being LGBT from our society.""Sex With A Minor Remains Illegal, In All Cases, Under SB 145Some of the claims on social media say the bill protects rapists or lessens penalties for statutory rape. That’s not the case. Nothing in the legislation would change penalties for statutory rape, which prosecutors in California can charge as either a misdemeanor or felony. It is illegal under current law for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor and that remains illegal under SB 145. Also, the bill does not apply to any sex offenders convicted of forcible rape. The legislation is supported by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault and by law enforcement groups such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the California District Attorney’s Association.Claim About A 21-Year-Old Having Sex With An 11-Year-OldThe second part of the Facebook post that we fact-checked claims, ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That’s also wrong. SB 145 only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range. ""The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close,"" the bill’s fact sheet estimates. ""At the end of the day, a judge will have full discretion to place someone on the registry, and a prosecutor can seek it.""Our RatingA widely-shared Facebook post claimed California had legalized ""pedophilia,"" and that ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That post and many like it are simply wrong. They grossly distort the proposals in state SB 145, which aims to eliminate a disparity in how LGBTQ young people are treated on California’s sex offender registry. The legislation would eliminate automatic sex offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry.The bill would not, in any fashion, make it legal for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor. The only change involves giving a judge discretion over whether to list an offender on the sex registry for certain sex acts. We rate the claims in the Facebook post Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.","https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB145,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.facebook.com/duron.barkley/posts/3509705189047797,https://twitter.com/ShannonGroveCA/status/1300897141678772225,https://twitter.com/aubrey_huff/status/1300477600691757056,https://www.facebook.com/133650406967/videos/329773798389436/?__so__=channel_tab&__rv__=all_videos_card,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.wksexcrimes.com/minors-cannot-legally-consent-to-sex-ca-pc-261-5/",,"Criminal Justice,Crime,LGBTQ,Sexuality,California,Facebook posts",,,,,

The third was snapped later, while Biden and Harris were outside for the fireworks display. Cardillo wrongly claimed that Biden was wearing a pin in the first two photos but not in the third photo, and a wristwatch in the third but not in the first two. He cited that as evidence that Biden’s speech must have been pre-recorded in multiple segments that were later stitched together. But the photos Cardillo plucked out were cherry-picked and misleading. The same argument — and photos — formed the basis of similarly inaccurate claims on Facebook.Video footage of Biden outside with Harris for the fireworks shows him wearing the very same pin that Cardillo claimed had disappeared from his suit. And the watch, which was clearly visible when Biden and Harris joined arms outside and raised them, was likely hidden beneath Biden’s sleeve for most of the speech, when his arms weren’t outstretched in the same way.At one point during the speech, the watch on Biden’s wrist could briefly be seen glimmering under his sleeve. It was also visible for a moment after the speech as Biden, Harris and their spouses waved to supporters shown on a video wall behind the podium. Between the speech, the interaction with supporters on screen, and the walk outside for the display of fireworks, Biden’s outfit never changed.

39,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/10/facebook-posts/claim-about-killing-payroll-tax-and-social-securit/,“Killing the payroll tax means killing Social Security.”,,politifact,,"​President Donald Trump’s weekend order to give millions of workers a break on payroll taxes caught many people by surprise, and created a range of reactions, criticism and questions.One post on Facebook said bluntly, ""Killing the payroll tax means killing Social Security.""This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This post is misleading. While it’s true that the payroll tax provides nearly 90% of the revenues for Social Security, Congress could decide to use another way to pay for the program. The program’s promise to people exists outside of the funding mechanism. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the money would be made up for with dollars from the general fund. The administration can’t promise that on its own. Congress, which controls federal spending, would need to pass a bill to make it happen.Social Security funding will not collapse due to this act alone, said William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank.And economist Eugene Steuerle at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told us that in the past, Congress has come through and reimbursed the trust funds. ""The only effect is to delay the day of reckoning when there is insufficient money left in the trust funds to pay out benefits,"" he said.Funding is critically needed. Featured Fact-checkYouTube videosstated on February 2, 2021 in a YouTube post“US Capitol raided 2/2/21.”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 3, 2021As we wrote last year, Social Security is like a forest pond with a stream flowing in at one end and water flowing out the other. If the pond is shrinking, there are only three ways to save it: increase the amount coming in (higher taxes), reduce the amount going out (cut some benefits), or count on rain from above to fill the pond (get a higher return on money in the trust funds today).The Social Security Administration compiled a list of legislative ideas that would extend the life of the trust funds.By and large, the bills in Congress now rely on option No.1 –– raising taxes to pay for future benefits. The number crunchers at Social Security estimated how much longer the trust funds would last under the different proposals.The government’s maximum time frame is 75 years, or 2093, and one bill achieved that. The package from Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., would gradually raise the current combined employer-employee payroll tax of 12.4% to 14.8% by 2043. The rate would go up one-tenth of a percent each year.Their package also changes the rule for high earners. They would apply the payroll tax to earnings over $400,000. Today, the maximum taxable amount is just shy of $138,000.The specifics vary, but other bills extend the solvency of the trust funds by making similar changes — raising the payroll tax for everyone and applying the tax for the first time to earnings above a certain level.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., co-sponsored a plan with Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., that would stretch the life of the trust funds to 2071. It would apply payroll taxes to income over $250,000 and levy a new 6.2% tax on investment income for couples making over $250,000 a year.Our rulingIn response to Trump’s executive action, a post on Facebook claimed, ""Killing the payroll tax means killing Social Security.""Trump’s proposal defers some payments of the payroll taxes, which experts say won’t kill Social Security. But the federal government does need to find ways to fund the program in the long term.

Tony Evers’ July 30, 2020, statewide mask order was predictable.Republican lawmakers launched a flurry of news releases condemning the Democratic governor’s decision, although more than 30 states now require masks in some public spaces. Republicans successfully sued Evers in March over his stay-at-home order.In a July 30, 2020 news release titled ""Statement on statewide mask mandate,"" state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, said mask decisions should be made by businesses and individuals, not governments.""I can understand why some businesses are requiring masks. That is their choice, just as it is my choice to do business elsewhere. That’s what America is about,"" he wrote. ""But no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog. That is also what America is about – free choice.""Given the context, Wanggaard is suggesting the governor’s mandate requires masks while walking a dog or in one’s house.Just one problem.Evers’ order does neither of those.What the order saysThe July 30, 2020, mask order generally requires all Wisconsin residents to wear face coverings in public spaces indoors starting Aug. 1, through the end of September.The order lays out numerous exceptions, including children under age 5, people who are eating or sleeping, individual speakers making a presentation for an audience and people who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition. Violating the order could result in fines of up to $200.RELATED: Wisconsin GOP lawmaker misleads with claim that masks are ineffective against COVID-19Featured Fact-checkGordon Hintz stated on February 5, 2021 in TV interview“We know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t.""By Haley BeMiller • February 12, 2021The core of the mandate is worded like this:Every individual, age five and older, in Wisconsin shall wear a face covering if both of the following apply:a. The individual is indoors or in an enclosed space, other than at a private residence; and;b. Another person or persons who are not members of individual's household or living unit are present in the same room or enclosed space.Face coverings are strongly recommended in all other settings, including outdoors when it is not possible to maintain physical distancing.The order earlier defines an ""enclosed space"" as a place open to the public, including outdoor bars, restaurants and park structures.Nothing there lines up with Wanggaard’s declaration about masks at home or walking his dog. The order explicitly refers only to indoor or enclosed spaces and notes private homes as an exception.Asked for evidence of Wanggaard’s claim, staffer Scott Kelly noted the City of Racine’s order would apply while walking a dog. It requires coverings within six feet of a non-family member in any outdoor space.But the news release was focused on the statewide order, not local ones.Our rulingWanggaard said he opposes statewide mask order because it would require him to ""wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog.""But an open outdoor area where a person would walk a dog isn’t within the requirements of the mandate, and the order has a specific exemption for private homes.We rate this claim False.","https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/30/tony-evers-issues-order-requiring-face-masks-indoors-starting-saturday/5531264002/,https://www.wispolitics.com/2020/sen-van-wanggaard-statement-on-statewide-mask-mandate/,https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/07/30/file_attachments/1507337/EMO01-FaceCoverings.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/30/michael-schraa/wisconsin-gop-lawmaker-misleads-claim-masks-are-in/,/personalities/gordon-hintz/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/gordon-hintz/wisconsin-assembly-minority-leader-right-relations/,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/journaltimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/40/140d765f-2282-5829-9c5c-5bf21c4bfc60/5f161a3600914.pdf.pdf",,"Public Health,Wisconsin,Coronavirus,Van Wanggaard",,,,,

""There are still things that we really need.""Hogan cited ""testing shortages"" as one area of concern. ""Not having supplies and running out of capacity across the country, it’s looking like it was back in March and April,"" he said, echoing the criticisms he made about the federal response in an op-ed headlined, ""Fighting alone.""We’re not privy to private communications between governors and the White House.

But amid soaring U.S. cases, news reports say some places are again experiencing long lines for tests, slow turnarounds for test results and shortages of personal protective gear.

(AP)""There has been some progress on PPE and other equipment, as well as testing, but not all states have everything they need,"" said James Nash, press secretary for the National Governors Association.The governors spelled out priorities for the federal government in an April letter to Congress, calling for increased access to test kits and equipment and funding for contact tracing, social services, and small business loans, among other things.Some requests have been completely or partially fulfilled, Nash said. Others, including a request for congressional funding to stabilize state budgets and a request for the administration to delay changes to hospital reporting requirements, remain outstanding. The Trump administration maintains that it is getting supplies where they’re needed. Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, the point person for coronavirus-related supplies, told the Washington Post in early July that he didn’t ""have the sense of there being severe shortages.""""I’m not going to tell you we’re able to meet all demand, but there’s significantly less unfulfilled orders today than in April,"" Polowczyk said.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Several states have outstanding requestsAbout a dozen state officials responded to our queries about the federal government’s handling of requests. Taken together, their responses painted the picture of an administration that hasn’t been as attentive to some states as Hannity described. Three states led by Democratic governors — Oregon, North Carolina and Washington — were particularly critical of the administration’s response, especially on testing. ""Woefully insufficient support from the federal government in terms of testing supplies has hampered our ability to expand Oregon’s testing capacity,"" said Charles Boyle, a spokesperson for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown.When Oregon asked for more testing supplies, the federal government sent a list of vendors and ""suggested we call them on our own,"" said Robb Cowie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is also waiting on 500,000 masks, 330,000 gowns and 300,000 gloves, Cowie said.North Carolina has similarly sought to increase testing. State officials asked in mid July for more federal testing sites to be set up in addition to the 13 in operation, said Kelly Haight Connor, a spokesperson for the state department of health and human services.The state provided a list of nearly 60 zip codes where more testing is needed, but only one new site was added by July 22, Connor said. North Carolina had also received 57% of the swabs and 50% of the preservation substance for transporting specimens that it requested for July.""There are currently nationwide barriers to further scaling widespread testing,"" Connor said.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee requested in a June letter that the administration use the Defense Production Act to produce more personal protective equipment. Inslee spokesperson Mike Faulk called claims that governors have all they need ""misleading"" and cited data showing the federal government has provided just a fraction of the masks, respirators, gowns, gloves and ventilators that Washington has requested since late April.""We are hearing from businesses and workers across Washington that they’re struggling to access PPE on the private market, are subject to price gouging, and being forced to use extreme conservation measures to stretch limited supplies over longer periods of time,"" Faulk said.A handful of states are awaiting shipments or have orders under review. Maryland is waiting on a shipment date for a May order of 500,000 N-95 masks and 100 oxygen assemblies, said Charles Gischlar, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health.A spokesperson for the North Dakota Department of Health listed requests for masks, gloves, gowns, boot covers and other equipment that haven’t been completely filled. Idaho also has requests that are under review, but a spokesperson for the state’s emergency management agency praised FEMA for fulfilling all other requests for personal protective gear.Some state representatives cited early problems but said the government has been responsive of late. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, said the state didn’t receive as many rapid response tests early in the crisis as it had requested, but he added: ""I wouldn't say that Wyoming had specific requests that were not met.""The Pennsylvania Department of Health said the state has received most of what it has needed, but not everything it has requested. Spokesperson Nate Wardle said the state asked for about 1,000 ventilators early on, for example, but that it did not receive any. ""We were told that we would receive them if there ended up being a need, which there has not been,"" Wardle said. In April, Wardle and representatives from more than 30 other states told us they were not aware of any COVID-19 patients needing a ventilator and not getting one.Representatives from other states — including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, and Ohio — said they have no outstanding requests. ""This administration has made things happen when we've asked,"" said Patrick Ptak, a spokesperson for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican.ABC News and CNN also queried all 50 states for their own fact-checks of Trump’s claims about the governors’ coronavirus needs. Both outlets heard from different states but found Trump’s claims to be inaccurate.Our rulingHannity said, ""This administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor.""That’s an exaggeration of the administration’s efforts to help states navigate the pandemic. While some states said they have no requests outstanding, representatives from several others told us that they have requests they are waiting on or requests that were never filled. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and chair of the National Governors Association, said ""it’s obviously not the case"" that governors have everything they need.We rate this statement False.","https://youtu.be/K341J5kCrKQ?t=252,https://youtu.be/K341J5kCrKQ?t=155,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072120/,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2007/26/sotu.01.html,https://youtu.be/9fcb47FJn-s?t=2670,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fcb47FJn-s&feature=youtu.be&t=2670,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/16/larry-hogan-trump-coronavirus/?arc404=true,https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/01/are-states-bidding-war-over-medical-gear-feds/,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-governors-coronavirus-medical-supplies-137658,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/08/ppe-shortage-masks-gloves-gowns/,https://apnews.com/481d933b0caa6f5fc61f466c86d4777b,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/federal-stockpile-thin-amid-coronavirus-surge-documents-show-n1233791,https://www.nga.org/policy-communications/letters-nga/governors-letter-regarding-covid-19-aid-request/,https://www.nga.org/news/press-releases/national-governors-association-leadership-urges-senate-to-approve-state-stabilization-funding/,https://www.nga.org/news/press-releases/governors-call-on-the-administration-to-delay-changes-to-hospital-reporting-requirements/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/08/ppe-shortage-masks-gloves-gowns/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/Gov%20Inslee%20ltr%20to%20VP%20Pence%20on%20PPE%20Defense%20Production%20Act%20%28003%29.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/23/has-president-donald-trump-invoked-defense-product/,https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/24/can-anyone-who-needs-ventilator-get-one-so-far-it-/,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/trump-claim-12-states-orders-coronavirus-supplies-unfilled/story?id=71946598,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/18/politics/fact-check-trump-june-july-2020/index.html,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-realistic-tone-coronavirus-briefing-repeats-false-claims/story?id=71923191,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/21/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-july-21/index.html",,"Health Care,Public Health,Pundits,States,PunditFact,Coronavirus,Sean Hannity",,,,,

On a Trump campaign call last week, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly took aim at Joe Biden’s vision for the sector.""If Joe Biden really cared about Pennsylvania, why would he propose killing over 600,000 jobs supported by fracking?"" said Kelly, a Republican congressman from Butler County, in northwest Pennsylvania.We wondered whether Kelly accurately described Biden’s position on fracking, which has lifted the economy in southwest Pennsylvania but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the earth’s surface.Biden wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land, but he has not called for banning fracking outright. He also would allow existing fracking operations to continue.His official position hasn’t changed, but it became muddled when Biden, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, his last opponent standing in the race for the nomination.Here’s an excerpt of their exchange:""I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,"" Sanders said. ""I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts and maybes about it.""""So am I,"" Biden replied.""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said.""No more — no new fracking,"" Biden said.Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking entirely – a sharp departure from his official position.And the former vice president’s critics pounced.Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden’s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, The Washington Post reported. And Sanders supporters accused Biden of misleading voters about his policy, which wouldn’t ban fracking outright, like Sanders wanted to.The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets from inaccurately reporting that Biden supports a total ban on fracking. The misstep is now being used against Biden in battleground states like Pennsylvania.Meanwhile, the statistic Kelly mentioned on the campaign call – the 600,000 Pennsylvania jobs supported by fracking that he says Biden wants to eliminate – comes from a 2019 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute. It estimates that 609,000 jobs connected to fracking would be eliminated across the state by 2025 if fracking were banned.The figure has popped up in several recent emails from Trump Victory, a political group led jointly by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, and it flashes across the screen at the end of a television ad released last month by America First Action, a Republican super PAC that supports President Donald Trump’s reelection. The 30-second spot has appeared in several Pennsylvania media markets, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.However, only 21,000 of the jobs the report says are set to disappear over the next five years are positions directly within the fracking industry. The others comprise companies that do business with the industry or benefit from it indirectly, and the report doesn’t specify which jobs would be at risk. It also hypothesizes that a ban on fracking would mean higher energy costs for American families and that with less disposable income to spend in their communities, local businesses would struggle and ultimately shed jobs. The report says the 609,000 jobs figure is calculated using economic modeling software that ""tracks monetary transactions within the economy between different industries, the government, and households,"" but it offers no other explanation of the math. A recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report shows that 20,146 people are currently employed in Pennsylvania’s oil and natural gas industry.Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Our rulingKelly said Biden proposed ""killing over 600,000 jobs supported by fracking."" Biden does not support an outright fracking ban, even though he spoke inaccurately about his stance on the debate stage in March. In addition, the 600,000-job figure comes from a report published by an organization that opposes limits on fracking and failed to fully explain how it calculated its projections on job lossesWe rate Kelly’s statement False.","https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/us-steel-edgar-thomson-works-braddock-fracking-20200317.html,https://www.inquirer.com/science/pennsylvania-fracking-hydraulic-fracturing-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-20200625.html,https://joebiden.com/climate/,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/biden-fracking-bernie-pledge-ban-debate-15133916.php,/personalities/tom-wolf/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/19/fact-checking-biden-fracking-fracas/,https://www.axios.com/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-fracking-democratic-debate-99040579-caff-45d5-b169-402a411a57d5.html,https://freebeacon.com/2020-election/biden-promises-no-more-drilling-under-his-presidency/,https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/hf_ban_report_final.pdf,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/478463-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-lead-joint-trump-rnc-fundraising-committee,https://www.politicspa.com/pro-trump-pac-hits-biden-on-fracking-and-coal/94748/,https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2018/article/shale-gas-production-and-labor-market-trends-in-the-us-marcellus-utica-region-over-the-last-decade.htm#_edn15",,"National,Elections,Pennsylvania,Mike Kelly",,,,,

The team relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1937 and received the first of its trademarks for the name in 1967. In 1972, Native American leaders representing multiple organizations requested that the team change its name, calling it a derogatory racial epithet. Wetzel, who had served as the Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians, asked team executives that same year to drop the ""R"" logo that was used at the time in favor of a profile of an Indian warrior. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021Wetzel spoke with the Washington Post in 2002, shortly before he died, and said he had told the team he’d like to see an Indian on their helmets instead of the big R. Within weeks, the team had a new logo based on a composite of Native American photographs, including one of early 20th-century Blackfeet chief, Two Guns White Calf. ""It made us all so proud to have an Indian on a big-time team,"" Wetzel told the paper, ""It's only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians.""Almost five decades later, Wetzel’s family expressed mixed reactions to the team’s announcement. His grandson, Bill Wetzel, told the Great Falls, Mont., Tribune (which is based about two hours from the Blackfeet Indian Reservation) that his grandfather was a good, honest man, and it bothered him that his grandfather’s name had been associated with a racial slur, but that times had changed.Jacob Wetzel, his great-grandson, told the paper that while the name change is ""long overdue,"" he was still sad to see the family legacy go.The NCAI, which describes itself as the country’s oldest, largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native advocacy organization, has pushed for the team to drop the name and imagery for years.  The organization commended the team for its decision.""We thank the generations of tribal nations, leaders, and activists who worked for decades to make this day possible.

Partially.Let’s take a look.What we knowThe call in question came one day after the state Supreme Court threw out Evers’ safer-at-home order, forcing officials to regroup and discuss a new response to the coronavirus pandemic. Evers, Vos and Fitzgerald talked respectfully to one another, but disagreed on next steps and what was happening in the state, based on a tape of the call released to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel under an open records request.When asked for evidence to back up Quinn’s claim, an aide pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a June, 11 2020 Department of Health Services briefing, at which Evers was asked about the recording incident, and a Wisconsin Radio Network-WSAU article about the briefing headlined, ""Evers won't fire staffer who secretly recorded phone call.""During the briefing, on the state’s response to COVID-19, Evers fielded multiple questions about the controversy and claimed he didn’t know the meeting was being recorded. Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021The governor’s chief legal counsel, Ryan Nilsestuen, said staff consented to the recording in compliance with the state’s one-party consent rule, but wouldn’t identify who OK’d it.""A staffer wanted help taking notes, and that’s why that staffer did that,"" Evers said. ""I will not discuss personnel issues in public, but needless to say, the practice has ended with this one time.""So Quinn is right that Evers won’t identify the staff member. But what about the discipline?Wisconsin Radio Network reported in its article that Evers said the staffer ""will not be fired."" One problem: Evers never said that in the call, according to a review of the call by PolitiFact Wisconsin.He has only continued to reiterate that he won’t talk about disciplinary matters, so it’s unclear how -- or whether -- the staffer has been disciplined. But in a June 23, 2020 DHS briefing, Evers hinted action had been taken, saying: ""This is obviously a personnel issue, and discipline measures are being handled internally,"" he said.Evers’ office did not respond to questions from PolitiFact Wisconsin.Our rulingIn the weekly GOP radio address, Quinn said Evers ""has refused to identify or discipline the staff member who secretly taped the conversation.""The governor has so far been very clear that he won’t identify the person. But he repeatedly refused to discuss any discipline in public. So, on that point, Quinn mischaracterized what Evers said and what is known about the situation.That leaves us with a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.That’s our definition for Half True.See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com","https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/10/republicans-lash-out-evers-over-secretly-recording-conversation/5337623002/,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/11/lawmakers-want-wisconsin-governor-fire-staffer-secret-recording/5341366002/,https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.17.20-GOP-Weekly-Radio-Address-Rep.-Quinn.pdf,https://www.facebook.com/WisconsinEye/videos/310634626766382/,https://wsau.com/news/articles/2020/jun/12/evers-wont-fire-staffer-who-secretly-recorded-phone-call/1028692/,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/,https://www.facebook.com/WisconsinEye/videos/197273124906882/?__xts__[0]=68.ARAs6TFvcJApJdGRanlCUq2pgPZIYaK471YEmw3VJTJyTyCuFWJ4IQZxdFUUVUudcS4qnWJfMOLcqUAnEkRmln2YTY5JgE9ek6ch-TkT42-XIYi1C4EHtQNUbWLVDvPjt6tp6OwhXgjipbr_t1eWwfYTyNuNtP5hmqt4naebA_mmkdPdL5movXyDQEQhCBaZcCHyY0LK7mz0VIot-08nS7pn89UqUOPM_euyjdX0JzjdL6ZEVtgsThSD8XJ64L0SRcSiKLW9R0r8VBjSopFYWVgGGStLiKP0U9P8ALp9oRqbLs1uMMIGZ937F6JOnm9kT-mP5kjrjjgN9VtSw0sEVxvSGWDk2nN_EnznkjKOlZFb&__tn__=HH-R",,"Legal Issues,States,Wisconsin,Romaine Quinn",,,,,

""If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.""It’s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It’s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day.With that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president’s remarks are not only misleading — they’re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what’s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.The big pictureEssentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more – and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do.""We will show more — more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don’t talk about it,"" he added.But that isn’t true.The numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump’s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak — per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run.But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others.A way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it’s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19.For instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.’s.""We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,"" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Put another way, a larger health crisis means — even after controlling for population size — the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)Featured Fact-checkBuck Sextonstated on February 8, 2021 in a blog item posted on FacebookThe science says “open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives.""By Victoria Knight • February 19, 2021And while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don’t have sufficient systems in place — from facilities to staff to medical supplies — for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us.If we stopped testing?And what about the president’s assertion that ""if we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases"" or none at all?On its literal phrasing, it’s absurd, experts said.""The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That’s because testing doesn’t create instances of the virus — it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.)But even if you take it figuratively – the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic – it’s still misleading.""We’re seeing a lot of cases because we’re testing? It just doesn’t ring true,"" Kates said. ""The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished.""The president’s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated – and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. ""If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,"" Blendon said. ""If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he’s gone.""But the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus.That gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn’t the only data source to reveal the pandemic’s existence. Let’s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence. Our rulingTrump argued that the nation’s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect.The most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn’t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we’re probably still undercounting compared to other countries.Testing doesn’t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it.And in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public’s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn’t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn’t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus.The claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis.

There still isn’t. Historians who have studied Nixon also told us that while Nixon tried to cover up the Watergate break-in, there isn’t conclusive evidence that he personally ordered the break-in.Revisiting the Obama wiretap conspiracyTrump first accused Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, a skyscraper serving as the Trump Organization’s headquarters in New York City, in a pair of March 4, 2017, tweets. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Trump and the White House wrongly claimed the allegation was backed by news reports, including from the New York Times.Lawmakers from both parties said they had seen nothing to substantiate the allegations, and an Obama spokesperson said in a statement that ""neither Barack Obama nor any White House official under Obama ever ordered surveillance of any U.S. citizen.""Trump didn’t drop the issue, however. Similar claims soon popped up online. We debunked doctored photos of Obama in handcuffs and made-up articles claiming he had been indicted, arrested or caught fleeing the country.All were fabricated.The Republican chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a joint 2017 statement that they saw ""no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance.""Days later, former FBI Director James Comey and former National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers both testified that there was no information to support Trump’s original tweets.Then, the Justice Department said in a court filing retrieved through a Freedom of Information Request that they ""have no records related to wiretaps as described"" by Trump.Finally, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, testifying about his 2019 report on the origins of the Russia investigation later led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, said his review found no proof that Trump Tower or Trump’s phone had been wiretapped.Did the FBI try & overthrow the presidency?—No Tap phones at Trump Tower?—NoPlant informants/spies?—NoThe IG report makes clear the Mueller investigation was NOT a “scam” conducted by “scum,” but an essential response to a serious attack on our democracy. pic.twitter.com/X6EMJ39whlFeatured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) December 12, 2019 Even Trump, speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity in 2019, said he made the allegation ""on a little bit of a hunch.""The FBI did conduct legal, court-ordered surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page as part of the broader Russia investigation that Horowitz determined was justified. Horowitz found some errors in the FBI’s application for a FISA warrant to surveil Page. But that’s different from the secret, warrantless wiretapping that was found at Watergate.What happened with Nixon?The Facebook post also botched the history surrounding Nixon’s resignation, experts said.Nixon resigned in the face of a likely impeachment after he was caught working to cover up a 1972 break-in and wiretapping at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters. The arrest of five burglars at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., where the headquarters was located, kicked off a series of events that led to Nixon’s resignation. But it’s not clear that Nixon directed the break-in himself, experts said.""There is no good evidence that Nixon knew about the Watergate break-in before the burglars got caught, nor is there any good evidence that he knew that anyone from his reelection campaign was planning to bug Democratic headquarters,"" said Ken Hughes, a historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and an expert on Nixon’s recordings.There’s no tape or memo tying Nixon to the break-in, said David Greenberg, professor of history and journalism at Rutgers University and author of a book on Nixon.There's some evidence to suggest Nixon knew, but it’s inconclusive.For starters, Nixon acknowledged in a memoir that he was generally comfortable with burglary and wiretapping, Greenberg told us. And in a recording days after the break-in, Nixon said, ""My God, the committee isn’t worth bugging, in my opinion. That’s my public line.""Finally, Watergate-conspirator Jeb Magruder also said Nixon was aware of the plot, Greenberg said. Those comments came in an interview in 2003, decades after Magruder wrote in a memoir that he didn’t know if Nixon had advance knowledge.""Whether he authorized the break-in and illegal wiretap is unknown,"" Greenberg said, adding that ""regardless of whether Nixon knew, no one disputes that it was an illegal wiretap.""So why did Nixon orchestrate a cover-up? Hughes said it was because the masterminds of the Watergate break-in — former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt and FBI agent G. Gordon Liddy — had been involved in ""other nefarious schemes that Nixon did order.""""Nixon ordered the cover-up because an unobstructed investigation of Hunt and Liddy’s crimes would lead back to his own,"" Hughes said. Among other things, those crimes would have included a never-implemented order to break into the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, Hughes said. The ""plumbers,"" as Nixon’s team of former CIA and FBI agents were called, also broke into the office of the psychiatrist working for Daniel Ellsberg, the analyst who leaked the government’s secret history of the Vietnam War.President Gerald Ford eventually pardoned Nixon, so he was ""never formally charged with any crimes or brought to trial,"" Greenberg said.But he probably could have been prosecuted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy, Hughes said, noting that members of his inner circle were indicted on those charges.Our rulingA Facebook post said: ""Why was it a crime for Nixon to wiretap the Democrats at Watergate but OK for Obama to wiretap Republicans at Trump Tower?""There’s no evidence to support the allegation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.

""13x less deadly than what was previously thought! Their analysis has since been banned from YouTube! Wow!""The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)But the doctors, owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, Calif., did not prove the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients is 0.03%. They pitched a theory that experts said was based on faulty calculations and leading medical associations ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" as ""reckless and untested musings.""Precise fatality rates for any new disease are tough to pin down, especially early in a pandemic. Many mild COVID-19 cases go unreported, making it hard to estimate how many infected individuals have died. Plus, the death toll due to COVID-19 could be higher than we know.Nevertheless, the way the doctors made their calculations was problematic, experts said.What the Bakersfield doctors saidThe Bakersfield doctors used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinics and in California to extrapolate to the entire state and put the fatality rate for infected individuals at 0.03%. They made the claims in an April 22 press conference broadcast by local news.They said 340 of the 5,213 patients they had tested at their clinics had returned positive results, meaning roughly 6.5% had COVID-19. On the state level, testing data from April 21 showed roughly 12% of tests coming back positive, they said.Scaling out to the entire state’s population, they estimated that 4.7 million Californians had been infected — 12% of the state’s total population of roughly 39.5 million people. They used that and the known number of California deaths at the time to get a fatality rate of 0.03%. Dr. Dan Erickson, one of the physicians, said the data showed ""millions of cases, small amount of death,"" adding that the fatality rate was close to that for the flu, which hovers under 0.1%.The doctors found a receptive audience in Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. Ingraham interviewed them on her show, and Carlson hyped their findings before claiming, in a statement experts said was misguided, that the coronavirus ""just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk also shared the briefing on Twitter.The doctors did not respond to requests for comment sent through their website.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on February 1, 2021 in a blog post""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law""By Madison Czopek • February 5, 2021Shaky mathThe doctors’ press conference made waves on social media. But soon after it aired, the calculations supporting their push to end shutdowns were roundly disputed.YouTube removed the video from its platform, citing a community guidelines violation. The American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" the doctors’ opinions in a statement.""The data cited by Drs. Erickson and Massihi is extrapolated from a small population to the state of California, resulting in misleading conclusions regarding the mortality of COVID-19. Their data is flawed and represents selection bias,"" the statement said.The University of Washington’s Carl T. Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that the doctors’ calculations amounted to ""sampling bias"" because patients seeking tests likely think they’re sick. The doctors’ calculations are like ""estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,"" he said.""Those are most likely people who had been symptomatic or had a reason to be tested,"" said Thomas Novotny, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at San Diego State University’s School of Public Health. ""That’s not representative of the state of California.""Testing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have encouraged health care providers to prioritize patients with symptoms, Novotny noted.The doctors’ comparison of the 0.03% rate they calculated with the flu’s mortality rate was also misleading, Novotny said. The first is ""a temporal estimate for what’s going on with COVID,"" he said, while the second is ""reported every year retrospectively."" ""That’s something that’s not comparable,"" he said.Some of the first widely reported figures have been case fatality rates, which are calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. But case fatality rates don’t reflect the true count of infections, experts say.Tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus have offered early glimpses at the fatality rates for all infected individuals in certain geographic areas, although concerns about false positive results have led some experts to question the findings.One thing we can say for sure? The Bakersfield doctors didn’t ""discover that coronavirus mortality rate is 0.03%,"" as the Facebook post claimed. They made an estimate, and experts said that estimate was flawed.Our rulingA Facebook post said: ""So 2 doctors from Bakersfield discover that coronavirus mortality rate is 0.03%. 13x less deadly than what was previously thought!

In California alone, where this post originated, estimates show there are nearly 130,000 homeless people. Featured Fact-checkGordon Hintzstated on February 5, 2021 in TV interview“We know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t.""By Haley BeMiller • February 12, 2021And, contrary to the Facebook claim, homeless shelters in cities across the country are dealing with outbreaks of the virus. In a study done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in four cities -- Seattle, Boston, San Francisco and Atlanta -- out of 1,192 residents tested at shelters, 25% were positive. As for employees of the shelters, out of 313 people tested, 11% tested positive. People experiencing homelessness are also more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, which also makes them higher risk, according to the CDC.For instance, physical health problems, mental health problems and substance abuse issues -- or a combination of some or all of those -- can make it harder for the body to defend itself against the virus. In addition, because of the conditions those experiencing homelessness face -- from living in close quarters to being unable to readily wash hands -- they are at a higher risk, according to a fact sheet from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. A COVID-19 factsheet from the group notes those over the age of 65 are more likely to become ill from the virus. Those who experience long-term homelessness tend to track the same health conditions as senior citizens, but at a younger age.It can also be difficult for the homeless to maintain social distancing due to crowded shelters, according to an April 2, 2020 report from Wired.com. And when shelters reach their capacity, many are forced to sleep outside. In Milwaukee, those experiencing homelessness are able to take refuge at the Saint Francis de Sales Seminary, where 110 rooms were set up to isolate those with coronavirus symptoms from those who are at high risk of contracting the virus, according to a March 29, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Plans called for those staying at the seminary to receive three meals a day and be checked on by members of the National Guard and the Milwaukee Health Department.  ""Most places do not have easily accessible health care (for the homeless), and then there are people who for many reasons are not going to rush to speak to any authorities -- police, medical, social service, etc. -- because of issues like mental health, addiction, criminal background or just plain suspicion,"" said David Wagner, an emeritus professor of social work and sociology at the University of Southern Maine, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.""I think that (COVID-19 infection) rates are generally going to be higher, if anything, among the homeless than the housed."" Our rulingA post making the rounds on Facebook claims homeless populations are immune to COVID-19.Not only is there no basis for this claim -- or claiming that any group has natural immunity to a virus that emerged just months ago -- the reality says otherwise.A CDC study of shelters in four major cities found that 25% of those tested were positive.

But the epidemiologist credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy said infection rate is not a reliable indicator of how a country is doing. Sweden goes voluntary, not mandatorySweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas; about 20% of residents were born abroad.In contrast to most of the United States, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although groups of larger than 50 people are banned. With elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged, what’s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it.The idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity — let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune or a vaccine becomes available.The infection ratesWe didn’t get replies when we asked for information from two North Carolina-based organizations led by Graham, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the international relief organization Samaritan's Purse.We found infection-rate figures from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford. Here are the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1 million people as of April 17, the day of Graham’s post:Spain: 3,910.1Italy: 2,794.18United States: 2,028.17United Kingdom: 1,518.62Sweden: 1,241.67So, Sweden’s known rate of infections is lower than the other countries Graham mentioned (and lower than the U.S. rate, as well). Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

""In other words, an unreliable measure.""Asked if Sweden’s strategy has been effective, Tegnell told us: ""Partly, to the extent that the health system managed the challenge and that there are always free beds. Not so well in protecting the elderly.""A surge in SwedenAs we were preparing this fact-check, there were reports that confirmed infections in Sweden were rising sharply. For example, according to The Guardian, Sweden reported 812 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 24, the highest number of new cases in the country yet reported.At the same time, if Swedish studies are accurate, infections and deaths in Stockholm, where more than half of the country’s COVID-19 deaths have occurred, should ""drop substantially in the coming weeks,"" Franks wrote on April 23. Our rulingUrging that the reopening of the United States not be delayed, Graham said the COVID-19 infection rate in Sweden, which has no forced lockdown, is lower than in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.Infection rates are lower, but that’s not necessarily a telling metric. Experts, including the epidemiologist credited with devising Sweden’s no-lockdown strategy, said there are other reasons, including a lack of testing, not to read too much into infection rates as a measure of how well a country is responding to the virus.

If you look at the bigger picture, no.Recent deathsIf you look for the answer to this question online, you’ll likely get mixed results.Several media outlets -- such as Live Science, Newsweek and others -- recently reported that coronavirus is the top cause of death in America. But those claims look at death rates in a very small window, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control tend to label diseases based on their toll in a given year. Live Science and Newsweek based their claims on a chart created by Dr. Maria Danilychev, who practices at Scripps Health in San Diego. Her chart takes the number of COVID-19 deaths in America as reported by Worldometer.com. Then it compares the deaths to the average daily deaths from other illnesses as reported by the CDC.For instance, if you look at the number of total deaths caused by heart disease reported in 2018 (647,457) and divide that by 365 (the number of days in a year) you get about 1,774 deaths per day. On April 20, Worldometer reported 1,939 coronavirus deaths across the U.S.Cohen’s office told PolitiFact that she also based her claim on how daily coronavirus deaths compare to past heart disease death averages. In an email to PolitiFact, DHHS spokeswoman Tracy Zimmerman cited the 30-day rolling average for COVID-19 deaths as documented on OurWorldInData.com.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Over the phone, Zimmerman added that Cohen didn’t mean for her comment to be taken as a broad statement about historical death trends.Deaths by yearAt the CDC, experts tend to look at a bigger picture when classifying something as a top cause of death.In fact, a spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics has pushed back at the idea that COVID-19 is the leading cause of death.""There are no data to support that theory,"" Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email to CNN on April 10.""We have limited data on 2020 deaths by cause, and no final official numbers yet for 2019, but we do know by looking at the final death totals in 2018 for the two leading causes of death in the U.S., Heart Disease and Cancer, there is no way that at this point COVID-19 comes anywhere close to those totals,"" Lancashire said.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. have used Lancashire’s comments to add context to claims about coronavirus.PolitiFact emailed the CDC on Tuesday to ask if its opinion had changed. ""Not really,"" CDC spokesman Brian Tsai said in an email.""One can argue that for some weeks, it is the leading cause for those particular weeks, but we typically talk about leading causes in terms of annual deaths,"" the spokesman said.  ""When looking at the data year-to-date (i.e., January-April), COVID-19 wouldn’t be the leading cause. In a typical year, there are more than 200,000 heart disease deaths from January-April.

And the number of new cases reported Monday – about 23,000 – was also well below last week’s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day.These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home.Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak’s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that ""we’re watching that data very closely.""Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania’s health care system is not at risk of being overrun.

All three originate in bats, and the recent COVID-19 outbreak suggests a ""likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.""Early in the outbreak, many patients in the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, had connections to a large seafood and live-animal market, which suggested animal-to-person spread. But later cases had no connection to the market, suggesting person-to-person spread. Scientists recently traced the first known case of COVID-19 to November 2019, in a patient with no connection to the market.RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemicThere’s plenty of scientific literature linking human coronaviruses to bats and other wild animals, particularly horseshoe bats in China. However, those studies stipulate that ""intermediate hosts"" are needed between bats and humans for the disease to spread — and meat isn’t necessarily part of the equation.For example, scientists first thought the Ebola outbreak started with the consumption of bat meat in Guinea. But Time reported that patient zero was likely infected by bat droppings that contaminated something she put in her mouth. MERS was also primarily spread through contact with live camels as opposed to camel meat.One of the first studies published about COVID-19 by Chinese researchers found that the virus could come from the same bats that were the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak. But the researchers cautioned that it’s ""likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans.""More recent studies of COVID-19 suggest that pangolins, scaly anteaters, could be that intermediate host. The animals are sought-after in China for their meat and scales, despite a worldwide ban.However, scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that pangolins are to blame for the coronavirus. And as of now, there is no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

NEVER."" One post we saw supposedly linked to the World Health Organization (WHO), but that lead to a 404 error page. Our research showed that most of these connections weren’t real. We decided to take a closer look and see if the diseases were significant enough to appear in party platforms or mentioned during candidate interviews. In most cases, they weren’t. Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today. SARSSARS is a coronavirus disease that spread from animals to humans and was diagnosed in China in 2003. SARS is a respiratory illness that affects breathing and is usually associated with coughing and a fever. It is spread through infected droplets that can survive on surfaces and could affect you if airborne. The SARS outbreak was stopped by July 2003, and in 2004 China took precautions by putting an embargo on animals that could have been the source of the disease. SARS affected eight people in the United States, and all these cases were contracted from travel abroad. SARS did not spread within the United States during the 2003 outbreak, and there have been no cases reported since then.SARS wasn’t a main campaign point in the 2004 presidential elections. It was referenced once in the Republican Party platform that was released in August 2004, under a section on international diplomacy that mentioned it as a joint concern of the United States and China. Avian fluAvian flu is usually found in aquatic birds and poultry, but in rare cases the influenza can cross over and infect humans. The symptoms of avian flu are like general influenza, including cough, fever, sore throat or headaches. The two most prevalent avian influenza viruses, H5N1 and H9N2, caused respiratory infections in humans in China as early as the 1990s. Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Egypt, Thailand, and many other countries struggled with the spread of H5N1 from 2004 to 2014.In 2014, there was only one case of H5N1 in North America, according to the CDC, and there were never any U.S. cases.As far as the 2008 presidential campaign is concerned, the Democratic Party platform mentioned avian flu briefly to justify strengthening international support systems. Nevertheless, the avian flu was a pandemic before the 2008 presidential election and has continued to be a problem even today, with new strains appearing as recently as 2017. The 2008 strain of the influenza had no significant influence on elections that we could determine. Swine fluThe swine flu, more specifically H1N1, started spreading in early 2009 and combined avian, swine, and human influenza in one new strain. The symptoms of the disease are like most flu symptoms, including a fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or a runny or stuffy nose. It also spreads like most influenza, with infected droplets that could be airborne or left on surfaces.The 2009 swine flu outbreak was the ""first global flu pandemic in 40 years,"" according to the CDC. The panic surrounding swine flu led to many extreme measures, including school shutdowns and people camping outside of free swine flu vaccine centers. But not everyone approved of the vaccine. PolitiFact checked a statement from October 2009 by Glenn Beck, a conservative talk show host who was against the swine flu vaccination. He believed the vaccine would lead to neurological problems like that of an influenza vaccine from the 1970s. We rated his statement Mostly False. Swine flu was a politically polarizing disease when it came to vaccinating and expanding the government’s health budget to prevent more outbreaks. It affected Americans directly and led to preventative legislation, but we found no examples of representatives using H1N1 in their campaigns during the 2010 midterm elections.MERSThe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a viral respiratory illness that was first found in dromedary (or one-humped) camels and then spread to humans. Most cases of the disease came from direct or in-direct contact with camels. Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Human-to-human transmission of MERS is more rare and mostly appears in unsanitary health care settings. Symptoms of the disease include fever, coughing, or trouble with breathing that can lead to pneumonia. MERS was first diagnosed in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC. All cases of MERS in 2012 were within the Arabian Peninsula, with two unlinked cases only reaching the U.S. in 2014. MERS was not brought up by any campaigns or included in any party platforms in the 2012 presidential election. It didn’t affect the U.S. until 2014, and even then the only comment was from press secretary Jay Carney, when he said at a press conference that President Barack Obama had ""been briefed"" on the MERS developments. Even though MERS did occur during the 2012 election, it didn’t seem to have any effect on U.S. politics.EbolaThe Ebola virus emerged periodically and caused outbreaks in many African countries as early as 1995. Ebola is introduced into the human population when there is close contact with the bodily fluids of infected fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines. Human-to-human transmission only occurs when touching infected human bodily fluids or objects that have touched infected human bodily fluids. The first signs of Ebola include fever, fatigue, or a sore throat. Later, the infected person will experience vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In the most deadly cases, there is internal and external bleeding.The first large outbreaks were in 1995 and 2000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, according to the CDC’s timeline. The CDC also documented only four diagnosed Ebola cases in the U.S. in 2014, and only two of the Ebola patients were infected in the U.S. In 2018, there were only outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.In 2014, an NPR report broke down how Ebola was used by both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats would use Ebola to ""argue that budget-cutting Republicans have deprived the government of the resources it needs to keep Americans safe."" Republicans used the government’s reaction to Ebola as an example of President Obama’s ""incompetence"" and linked Ebola to border security. In contrast, Ebola was not a topic in the 2018 election because Ebola was only concentrated in two African countries and had a very low chance of coming to the U.S. again, according to the Association of Health Care Journalists.Ebola was not a huge threat to Americans in the United States despite some cases in 2014, but it was used as a political tool in the 2014 midterm elections. Comparatively, there were no cases of Ebola in 2018 in the United States, and it was not used as rhetoric in the elections.ZikaZika is spread mostly through the bite of infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted through unprotected sex. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). While Zika has a low death rate, it became a larger issue when it was linked to fetal brain defects in infected pregnant women’s children. Outbreaks of the Zika virus have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands since 1952, according to the CDC. It began to appear more in the United States in 2015 and 2016 because of people travelling from tropical climates and from local mosquitos in Texas and Florida. In 2016, the Zika outbreak hit a peak, with 5,168 symptomatic Zika virus disease cases reported in the U.S., according to the CDC’s 2016 report.Zika sowed division in an already divided Senate but didn’t impact the presidential race. President Obama’s administration asked Congress ""for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to enhance… efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus"" in February 2016. It took almost seven months for Congress to approve a federal spending bill to prevent the Zika virus from spreading. The New York Times reported that they voted to advance the funding, despite disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on where the funding should come from. A month later, the bill had fallen apart, with the Democrats rejecting provisions added by the Republicans. Finally, the bill passed on Sept. 28, 2016, with concessions made by both sides.During this congressional tug of war, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both brought up the Zika virus only once during their campaigns. When Trump was asked about how he would deal with the Zika virus while he campaigned in Florida, he said that Rick Scott, the state’s Republican governor, was doing a great job and ""he's going to have it under control, he probably already does."" Clinton urged Congress to pass a spending bill and ""called for more public education about the virus’ dangers, the development of a rapid diagnostic test, investment in treatment and a vaccine, better mosquito control and abatement, and improved access to health and family planning services.""While the Zika virus had an impact on Americans in 2016 and showed how divided the Senate was, we found little impact on the 2016 presidential election.COVID-19The 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a respiratory disease that has symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is spread by airborne respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can also be spread by touching surfaces that droplets have landed on.Like it says in the name, COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has spread across the world as people traveled to and from China. There are now 647 cases in the U.S. as of March 10, 2020.As COVID-19 has spread in the United States, Congress and President Donald Trump have approved funding to create a vaccine and prevent a pandemic. On March 6, 2020, Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill. This time, the virus has been a major point of discussion for the president and other presidential candidates. Our rulingA post on social media says ""Every election year has a disease"" ... SARS in 2004; avian flu in 2008; swine flu in 2010; MERS in 2012; Ebola in 2014 and 2018; Zika in 2016 and the coronavirus in 2020. But most of these diseases were discovered and spread before the election years. Some of the diseases never impacted the United States, and never came up as a large point in a campaign. There is some evidence that Ebola in 2014 impacted the election, but otherwise there is no straightforward connection between national U.S. elections and pandemics.The post is not accurate.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)While unofficial tax calculators have cropped online purporting to show the tax implications of Sanders’ plans, experts told us there simply isn’t enough data yet on Sanders’ tax proposals to determine how much in additional taxes a particular taxpayer might have to pay.Debt would go awaySanders says that within six months, his proposal would cancel the $1.64 trillion in student debt owed by 45 million Americans, saving a typical borrower $3,000 per year. The $3,000 is based on 2018 government data that shows the typical monthly payment is between $200 and $299 per month. His legislation, rolled out in June 2019, applies to loans that were made, insured or guaranteed by the federal government. It’s the same proposal Sanders makes in his presidential campaign.Wall Street investors pay for itSanders would pay for the cancellation by imposing a new tax on securities transactions, or what Sanders calls ""Wall Street speculation,"" to generate what his campaign says would be more than $2.4 trillion over the next decade.Specifically, he would place a 0.5% tax on stock trades — 50 cents on every $100 of stock — a 0.1% fee on bond trades and a 0.005% fee on derivatives trades.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 8, 2021 in a Facebook postMichelle Obama earned a doctorate after leaving the White House.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 9, 2021Looking at the investment tax alone, a person would have to buy or sell $1.08 million worth of stock per year in order to incur $5,400 in new tax liabilities, said Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.""I suspect that there are not many holders of outstanding student loan debt that could afford financial transactions of this magnitude,"" he told us.Other tax increasesBut the investment tax is not the only new one Sanders has proposed. A calculator on a pro-Sanders website, bernietax.com, estimates that a single person making $250,000 per year and currently paying $3,000 in health costs would lose $5,500 per year in disposable income due to a 4% Sanders tax proposes as one way to pay for his Medicare for All proposal.

71,,,,barely-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/02/amy-klobuchar/Klobuchar-misfires-Wisconsin-voter-claim/,"“While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls.”",,politifact,,"In the most recent Democratic presidential debate, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she didn’t want to keep rehashing the past. Instead, she said, she’s focused on the way forward.Klobuchar then went on to outline a series of issues she believes demand attention. One of them was voting rights, and she used Wisconsin to underscore her point.""While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls,"" she said Feb. 25, 2020 in South Carolina.Wisconsin’s voter rolls have been front and center in recent months after the state Election Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved, asking them to update their registrations if relevant. The plan was to remove them from the rolls in 2021. That prompted a lawsuit from a conservative law group contending those voters should be taken off the rolls now. The matter ultimately may go to the state Supreme Court.Klobuchar’s campaign said she was referring to voter purges in 2017 and 2018 — not those at the center of the lawsuit. But that doesn’t explain why she implied it was happening right then.(Note: Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential campaign March 2, 2020, after a sixth-place finish in South Carolina, as we were working on this fact-check. We decided to complete it, since removal of voters from the state’s rolls is an ongoing issue.)Let’s see where Klobuchar’s claim lands.Changes to Wisconsin’s voter rollsWhen asked for evidence for Klobuchar’s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. This included 44,000 voters in Milwaukee alone.The decline stemmed from two separate actions in 2017 and 2018, according to Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission.To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn’t voted in four years and didn’t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Over half of those voters didn’t respond, and roughly 43% of the notices were returned as undeliverable. Some people had died or were deactivated for other reasons.Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency’s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration. Once officials realized there were problems with accuracy of that list, they implemented a supplemental poll book to ensure anyone incorrectly removed could vote without reregistering. The commission later said it found few examples of voters who were removed inappropriately.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021So, the commission did deactivate hundreds of thousands of voters in 2017 and 2018. But by saying they were ""kicked off,"" Klobuchar suggests the motive was voter suppression.Magney disputes that. In any case, Wisconsin has same-day registration, so removal from the rolls does not prevent people from voting, as it might in some states if done too close to election day.The latest election saga There is another problem with Klobuchar’s statement: She said Wisconsin has purged voters ""while we are all sitting here debating."" That suggests the issue is immediate — not one from several years ago.As we noted, Wisconsin is currently in the throes of a controversy over its voter rolls. The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, representing three suburban Milwaukee men, filed a lawsuit arguing that 234,000 voters who may have moved and received notices in the mail should be removed from the rolls within 30 days if they don’t respond. The commission had said it wouldn’t suspend registrations until after April 2021.Critics of the lawsuit believe any voter purge would be an affront to the democratic process and could inadvertently affect voters who didn’t even move. The case has drawn heightened attention because of Wisconsin’s pivotal role in this year’s presidential race.In December 2019, an Ozaukee County judge sided with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and ordered the election commission to remove those people from the voter rolls.

Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomey’s campaign. The Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race was the most expensive general-election Senate contest in the nation in 2016, reaching a total of $170 million with candidate and outside spending combined.Senate split if McGinty, a Democrat, had wonThe Facebook post misleads when it states, ""if McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won."" At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats.

However the majority leader was the Republican leader.If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations.""The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,"" he said. ""To the contrary, some power sharing arrangement would again be negotiated and the term ‘control,’ an informal term, really would not fit. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican.""Senate vote on KavanaughNow that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats ""could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.""This statement does have a qualifier of ""could,"" but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. That’s misleading.The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor.If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49.

The post (which wrongly says 70 hostages were held) features images of Sanders, Iran’s former leader Ayatollah Khomeini and President Jimmy Carter and says:""Socialist Workers Party leader Bernie Sanders supported Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, condemned president Carter for imperialism, and accused the hostages of being CIA spies.""Is this what Democrats stand for?

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)This claim exaggerates Sanders’ involvement in the Socialist Workers Party and wrongly says Sanders, like the party, labeled some of the hostages spies. Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, supported the Socialist Workers Party and spoke at some of the organization’s events in the 1980s, but he was neither the leader nor a member. The organization did criticize the Carter administration’s approach to the crisis and suggested some of the embassy hostages were spies. But Sanders did not.Socialist Workers Party position on Iran crisisThe post’s claims appear to come from a January 2020 Daily Beast opinion column by Ronald Radosh headlined, ""When Iran Took Americans Hostage, Bernie Backed Iran’s Defenders.""The Socialist Workers Party is a far-left revolutionary group that originally supported Leon Trotsky, a Soviet communist and Marxist theorist whose beliefs are commonly known as ""Trotskyism.""In the piece, Radosh wrote that in 1980, Sanders ""aligned himself with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the self-proclaimed Trotskyist revolutionary party. (The column goes too far in saying Sanders joined the party.)Featured Fact-checkYouTube videosstated on February 2, 2021 in a YouTube post“US Capitol raided 2/2/21.”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 3, 2021The social media post inaccurately jumbles this information. Here’s the historical context.In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 — the day Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency from Carter, who had faced wide public disapproval over the protracted crisis.The Socialist Workers Party criticized the U.S. government’s approach during the crisis, writing in its newsletter The Militant that Carter’s administration was ""defying the wishes of the vast majority of the American people"" and called on the government to meet Khomeini’s demands, as well as suggesting that some of the hostages were spies.At the time of the hostage crisis, Sanders was in Vermont, running for mayor of Burlington as an independent, though he identified himself at the time as a socialist. Still, we could find no record of any public statements by Sanders on the crisis.Sanders’ Socialist Workers Party tiesSanders, who was mayor from 1981 to 1989, was not a member of the Socialist Workers Party during or after the Iran hostage crisis, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports. But Sanders was affiliated with the party, even though Vermont in 1980 did not have a branch, according to The Militant. Sanders served as one of the Vermont Electoral College electors for SWP leader and presidential candidate Andrew Pulley. But Pulley’s candidacy was futile, because he was only 29 years old at the time, too young to be president under the U.S. Constitution (the minimum age is 35).Sanders also spoke at some of the party’s campaign events in 1982 and 1984.In 1980, Sanders said he didn’t support all of the party’s positions, telling the Rutland Daily Herald newspaper (hat-tip Snopes): ""Although I am not in agreement with the SWP on all issues, I strongly support that party’s attempt to become a nucleus for a national labor party, which will fight for the interests of low-income and working people.""Sanders' relationship with the party seems to have largely diminished since then, and he hasn’t publicly addressed his affiliation with the organization during his current campaign for president. A Sanders campaign spokesperson referred us to their comment for the Snopes story: ""Sen. Sanders did not think the hostages were spies nor did he support their captivity. Any suggestion otherwise is nonsense.""We rate this False.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159264721936124&set=a.10150145686456124&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-iran-took-americans-hostage-bernie-backed-irans-defenders,/personalities/youtube-videos/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/youtube-videos/no-capitol-wasnt-raided-feb-2/,https://www.themilitant.com/1979/4346/MIL4346.pdf,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/bernie-sanders-mayor/407413/,https://themilitant.com/1980/4439/MIL4439.pdf,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1990/11/12/636190.html?pageNumber=28,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/bernie-sanders-campaigned-for-marxist-party-in-reagan-era,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bernie-sanders-iran-hostage-crisis/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cocaine-mitch/",,"Iran,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts",,,,,

They illuminate a key ideological divide between Republicans seeking more time behind bars for certain offenders and a Democratic governor who has called for cutting the state's prison population in half in the coming years.In the GOP Weekly Radio Address on Feb. 13, 2020, state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, used a series of numbers to support bills he said would ""help keep Wisconsin communities safe.""""FBI data shows violent crime rates increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017,"" said Sanfelippo. ""In fact, when combining Wisconsin’s 10 largest cities, the violent crime rate increased by 24% during that time, while decreasing by 14% on a national average.""It’s certainly an eye-catching claim. Is violent crime up in all but two of the hundreds of cities across Wisconsin?We checked it out — and found a case study in how not to use data. Sanfelippo misquoted the stat he was trying to use while constructing an argument riddled with other data-related problems.Let’s see what the data actually tells us.Newer data availableAsked for evidence supporting his discussion of violent crime, Sanfelippo’s office pointed us to a policy brief the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum published in December 2019.Amid a discussion of police spending and staffing, the paper used FBI data to say violent crime had risen in Wisconsin from 2008 to 2017. The FBI gathers crime stats from departments around the country, and reports a ""violent crime"" tally based on the number of homicides, sexual assaults, robberies and aggravated assaults.(We should point out the Wisconsin Department of Justice also gathers crime data that in some cases varies slightly from the FBI, but we’ll limit our analysis here to the FBI data since that is what is cited by both Sanfelippo and the report he relied on.)Sanfelippo and the paper point to 2017 data. But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,  shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases.The number of violent crimes Wisconsin law enforcement reported to the FBI fell from 15,931 in 2017 to 15,263 in 2018.But that’s not necessarily a reliable number. Here’s why.Not all data comparableThe FBI crime data is difficult to compare year-to-year because it’s not comprehensive.Not every police department reports their data every year. And state and local officials regularly change their reporting practices, changing definitions or other factors in generating counts.To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now ""not comparable to previous years’ data.""This was not taken into account in Sanfelippo’s claim or the memo his office cited as backup.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities — which you’ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime.We’ll also note that while Sanfelippo referred to cities, the FBI data includes cities, towns and villages, so we’ll refer to the group as municipalities here.Key outlier ignoredSanfelippo — like many other Republicans — is using the FBI data to say violent crime is on the rise across Wisconsin. But that's not really what the data shows.More than two-thirds of the violent crimes in Wisconsin take place in Milwaukee, so in large part the statewide trend is just a reflection of what’s happening in the state’s largest city.Violent crime in Milwaukee has edged up and down in recent years, but 2018 was the city’s lowest mark since 2013.Addressing these three data issues (age, comparability and the Milwaukee outlier) lets us bring the state’s actual violent crime trend into clearer focus. And we find there essentially is no trend.Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities — still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018.But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change.Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 — virtually unchanged.Claim drastically overstatedBut all of these data mistakes pale in comparison to Sanfelippo’s dramatic misuse of the memo’s description.The memo said — again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing — that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state’s 10 largest cities.Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in ""all but two Wisconsin cities.""That’s not even close to true.Using the 206 municipalities referenced above — those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven’t changed reporting practices — we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20.Sanfelippo acknowledged using the stat incorrectly when questioned by PolitiFact Wisconsin. The reference, which was wrong in both the recorded and written versions of the radio address, came from a script that Sanfelippo said wasn’t written by him or his office.""It wasn’t intentionally done, it was just a mistake,"" he said. ""I should have picked up on that for as much as I have been talking about crime these last few months.""Our rulingArguing for a series of tough-on-crime bills, Sanfelippo said in a statewide radio address that violent crime ""increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017.""Almost every word of that is wrong.Any comparison should have factored in the 2018 data, which was available at the time. The comparisons shouldn’t include the many places where reporting practices changed. And even the use of the word cities is wrong since the dataset includes towns and villages.Most importantly, Sanfelippo misstated the claim he was trying to repeat. In actuality, there are more than 100 Wisconsin municipalities where the crime rate did not rise — more than half the communities included in the best available FBI data.That makes Sanfelippo’s claim not only false, but ridiculous.

""It’s about building for the future of this city. We’ve done so by creating homes, 7,000 homes.""The issue of housing in Milwaukee has also entered the mayoral race. Primary opponents, including state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, have criticized Barrett’s record on housing. Is Barrett, first elected in April 2004, correct that 7,000 homes have been created since he took office? Let’s take a look.The evidenceWhen asked for the evidence to back up the claim, Barrett’s staff directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Department of City Development (DCD) report. The report shows that as of October 2019, a total of 7,261 affordable housing units had been developed since Barrett took office in 2004. Of those, 690 were downtown and 6,571 were outside downtown. All are rental units.""The majority are apartments located in both newly-constructed buildings and existing buildings, including offices, manufacturing space, warehouses and vacant schools that have been redeveloped into apartments,"" said Martha Brown, deputy DCD commissioner, in an email. ""The total also includes several hundred new single-family homes, and both one- and two-family vacant houses that have been completely rehabilitated and made available as affordable rental housing.""Milwaukee housing changesMap shows the change in the number of residential properties in each aldermanic district from 2004 to 2019.Design: Eric Litke, Milwaukee Journal SentinelSource: Wisconsin Elections Commission According to Brown, the developments were financed with federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits allocated by the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. Under the program units are deemed affordable based on a variety of factors, but can’t go to anyone making more than 60% of the median income for the area. For a family of four, the cut-off would be $49,380. In many cases, the apartments are earmarked for those making an even smaller percentage of the median income.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Brown also noted that Habitat for Humanity develops affordable housing for homeownership and those units were not included in DCD’s count.Brian Sonderman, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Milwaukee, said since 1984 the group has built or rehabbed 620 single-family homes and has assisted more than 700 additional families through affordable home repair and loan assistance.""We believe affordable homeownership is key to helping local families build strength, stability and independence,"" Sonderman said in an email.Sonderman said the city has helped the process with acquisition as well as funding. For instance, the city may sell vacant lots to the group for $1 each. Habitat also receives federal grant money allocated through the city.So, by the numbers, Barrett is on target.Is there anything else to consider?Residential vs. apartmentsAccording to the city Assessor’s Office, the count of residential properties as reported on the city’s 2004 Statement of Assessment (the year Barrett was elected) was 135,352.

Slightly different versions of the legislation have since passed the Senate and the House, largely on party-line votes with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, backs the measure.Jenkins spoke against the bill and made an interesting statistical claim.""Simply put, there are more guns in this country than there are citizens,"" he said. ""All you’re going to do is continue to drive up the cost for the criminal to purchase the illegal guns. Evil will still be committed.""Are there more guns than people in the United States?The estimatesHard figures on the number of guns in the U.S. are elusive.In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the country. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed, ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down.""At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation.Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end - 310 million guns - that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The study said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the ""total number of firearms available to civilians"" as of 2009.That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 307 million and the citizenship estimate of 285 million, estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau.But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed.Featured Fact-checkRon Johnsonstated on February 15, 2021 in a radio interviewSays Jan. 6 Capitol riot “didn’t seem like an armed insurrection.”By Eric Litke • February 15, 2021Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- have told PolitiFact the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online.The lead author of the study, Deborah Azrael, says respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and told not to count BB guns, replicas or other firearms that were not functioning. The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015.The number of U.S. citizens at that time, according to the Census Bureau, was about 299 million.Other highlights of the Harvard study:Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns.The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns.39% of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8% of the gun owners -- that 8% of all owners owned 10 or more guns.Prior fact checksPolitiFact has previously rated two claims that there are more guns than people in the U.S. That’s similar - but not identical - to Jenkins’ claim that there are more guns than citizens. One of the claims was made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia; the other in 2018 by Kevin Nicholson, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in Wisconsin. PolitiFact National, noting the lack of firm gun numbers, rated each statement Half True.Our rulingJenkins says, ""There are more guns in this country than there are citizens.""There is no actual count of the number of firearms in the United States.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Here’s what we know.There is an outbreak of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus. There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. One of them, categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become known as the Wuhan coronavirus because of the city of about 11 million people in central China where it was discovered. Another is known as SARS-CoV and is the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.Two weeks before this Facebook claim was posted, the New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had blamed a new coronavirus for sickening 59 people in Wuhan. The cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. By the day the Facebook post was published, the outbreak had killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 400 — including a Washington State man who had recently been to the Wuhan region — and had spread to several other countries, according to the Times.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on February 1, 2021 in a blog post""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law""By Madison Czopek • February 5, 2021Despite what the Facebook post suggests regarding a recently expired patent and a new vaccine, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus available. The partial image of a patents page that is included with the post refers to a patent associated with the coronavirus that causes SARS, a different illness.It makes no sense that there could have been a patent for a vaccine for a coronavirus that was only just discovered.In fact, the CNN story cited in the post quotes a top U.S. federal health official as saying the National Institutes of Health is merely ""in the process of taking the first steps"" towards developing a vaccine, and that it would be more than a year until a vaccine might be available.""There are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, in a PolitiFact interview.As for the post’s reference to a quarantine, the Washington Post reported that Chinese health ­authorities were seeking to impose a ""­quasi-quarantine"" in the area of the outbreak, advising people in Wuhan not to leave. But the authorities could also forcibly quarantine people known to have or suspected to have the coronavirus, according to the report.Hours after the Facebook post, the Chinese government announced plans to quarantine Wuhan, indicating the city will cancel planes and trains leaving the city and suspend buses, subways and ferries.Before we close, two points for putting this outbreak in perspective:1. This coronavirus has been compared to the SARS outbreak of 2003, which caused 774 deaths in more than two dozen countries (none in the United States). But the rate of fatalities currently appears to be much lower; and it is still unclear the degree to which human-to-human transmission is possible with this virus, according to an article by Adalja.2. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the Wuhan coronavirus is ""a serious public health concern,"" but the immediate health risk to the general American public ""is considered low at this time.""Our rulingA Facebook post states: ""So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine.""There was an outbreak in recent weeks of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus. News media reported that Chinese authorities have taken steps to quarantine Wuhan, the city in China where the outbreak was discovered.More importantly, there was no expired patent related to the Wuhan coronavirus, and there is currently no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, either.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.","https://www.facebook.com/isaiah.rastetter/posts/3336961516376285,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html,https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/china-chine/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/96289.aspx?lang=eng,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/what-is-coronavirus.html,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/blog-posting/no-cdc-isnt-inflating-coronavirus-statistics/,http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/cbn/2020/cbnreport-01222020.html,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7220852B1/en?oq=coronavirus+US+10%2f822%2c904,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/health/coronavirus-nih-vaccine-development/index.html,http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/adalja/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-officials-urge-people-not-to-travel-in-and-out-of-city-at-center-of-virus-outbreak/2020/01/21/60680d3e-3c2d-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/479418-chinese-government-quarantines-the-city-of-wuhan,https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/19/tavis-smiley/tavis-smiley-says-ebola-outbreak-not-bad-sars-outb/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html,http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/cbn/2020/cbnreport-01222020.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html",,"China,Public Health,Facebook Fact-checks,Coronavirus,Facebook posts",,,,,

The United States and other countries lifted the sanctions and freeze on funds after international inspectors verified in 2016 that Iran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program.So the money was Iran’s. It wasn’t handed to Iran by the United States or Obama, nor was it funded by U.S. taxpayers.It’s not clear what ultimately happened to the funds. In January 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected that some of the money would end up with organizations involved in terrorism. But there’s no evidence that the money was behind the strike in Iraq.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post“Trump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 4, 2021On Jan. 5, after a U.S. airstrike killed top Iranian military leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would no longer comply with the limits the deal placed on its ability to enrich uranium.A separate cash paymentIn addition to the unfreezing of assets, the United States did provide Iran $1.7 billion as part of a settlement ending a legal dispute.That money was part of a cash transfer that the Congressional Research Service reviewed. It resolved an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, but it was never delivered.As we’ve noted before, there was $400 million in that account as of 1990, and negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount. The United States sent the money to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies.But this was a repayment, meaning the United States was giving Iran its money back with interest. And while the interest came from a government fund maintained by taxpayer dollars, the money being reimbursed originated with Iran, not the U.S. taxpayer.And again, there’s no evidence that this money ultimately went toward the recent missile strikes.Our rulingA Facebook post said, ""The missiles that were launched at American forces in Iraq from Iran, were funded by Barack Obama, with American tax dollars.""The 2015 Iran nuclear deal was signed by multiple nations, and it did not involve the United States or Obama cutting a check to Iran. The funds Iran received were its own frozen assets. American tax dollars were never part of the deal.A separate payment that went to Iran under Obama was to settle a decades-old dispute over U.S. military equipment that Iran paid for but never received.We rate this statement False.Clarification and update, Jan. 10, 2020: The Washington Free Beacon story cited by the author of the viral image never alleged that taxpayer dollars were used to fund the missiles launched at American forces in Iraq. An original version of this story may have been unclear on this point.","https://www.facebook.com/ConHQ222/photos/a.103957401042721/144312590340535/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-admin-paid-iran-1-7-billion-taxpayer-funds/?fbclid=IwAR089dL6lLM10kzs6IEMoofAqUUWKHmMJp6l-W-SJ9Xlxy-QbiPx9mBDnOY,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/17/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-we-are-not-giving-iran-150-billion/,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2020/jan/07/facebook-posts/facebook-claim-wrongly-states-obama-gave-iran-150-/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-miscasts-money-and-terms-iran-nuclear/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2020/jan/08/fact-checking-donald-trumps-speech-after-iran-miss/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/29/ron-johnson/obama-administration-admits-cash-iran-deal-will-go/?hootPostID=b8d0181ad093e898e4eae245c62e582e,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/08/politifact-sheet-6-things-know-about-iran-nuclear-/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/29/ron-johnson/obama-administration-admits-cash-iran-deal-will-go/?hootPostID=b8d0181ad093e898e4eae245c62e582e,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-kerry/,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/blog-posting/no-there-wasnt-attempted-assassination-against-tru/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-says-it-will-no-longer-comply-with-nuclear-enrichment-limits-under-2015-deal-11578249461,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-150-billion-and-18-billion-c/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-miscasts-money-and-terms-iran-nuclear/,https://apnews.com/a665a7e486d24bdb982b9c470bb85fdf/us-payment-17-billion-iran-made-entirely-cash",,"Corrections and Updates,Iran,Taxes,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts",,,,,

Qassem Soleimani.Doocy: ""As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you can stop an imminent attack on Americans but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terror leader, would you pull the trigger?""Biden: ""Well, we did. Guy’s name was Osama bin Laden.""Doocy: ""Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?""Biden: ""No, I didn’t. I didn’t.""It is a challenge to fact-check what Biden told Obama in advance of the May 2011 raid to kill bin Laden, because their conversations were largely private. However, Biden has made conflicting statements about what he told Obama.In 2012, Biden said he told Obama ""don’t go"" and called for him to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound. But in 2015, Biden said he told Obama ""go.""In 2012 Biden said he told Obama not to launch raid on compoundIn January 2012 at a Democratic congressional retreat, Biden recounted how Obama asked senior officials whether they should go ahead with the raid. Everyone in the room ""hedged their bet"" except CIA Director Leon Panetta, who said ""go."" ""Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go,"" Biden recounted. ""‘We have to do two more things to see if he's there."" (He did not explain what the two additional things were at the time.)(When a reporter asked White House spokesman Jay Carney in 2012 about Biden’s comments stating he was against the raid, Carney said: ""I know that he is speaking accurately."")In May 2012 on NBC’s Meet the Press, Biden said he told Obama ""follow your instincts.""""I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there,"" Biden said. Obama’s statement during a debate in 2012 supported the idea that Biden was critical about the raid proposal. Obama said that ""even some in my own party, including my current vice president,"" critiqued the proposed raid.Biden later said he told Obama to go ahead with the raidBy 2013, Biden started to recast his account of what he told Obama.In January 2013, the New York Times magazine wrote that Biden had advised against the 2011 raid on the house in Pakistan that was suspected to be bin Laden’s hideaway.But the quote by Biden was more vague: ""I remember walking up to his office and saying, ‘Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.’"" In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021On Oct. 20, 2015, at an event honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden said when Obama asked everyone in the room whether he should go forward, only two were definitive: Panetta said ""go"" and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said ""don’t go.""  Biden recounted that he suggested a third option, though he said it was one ""that I didn’t really think we should do."" Biden said he proposed to take one more pass with an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm that it was bin Laden at the compound. Then Biden said he told Obama in a private conversation, ""I thought he should go but to follow his own instincts.""That led to multiple news reports showing that Biden had revised his account from 2012 when he said he told Obama ""don’t go.""Days later, CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell asked Biden to clear up the confusion about whether he told Obama to conduct the raid.""Everything I said was completely accurate. I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story,"" he said, referring to the Mondale event.Biden said he first told Obama to do another check, and then he told Obama to follow his own instincts: ""I said, ‘You should do that, and there would be still time to have the raid, but that’s what I would do."" Biden continued: ""Immediately, we got up, as we always do, and I walked out with the president. We walked up to the Oval. I said, ‘Mr. President, follow your instincts. I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.’ "" Biden’s 2020 campaign pushed back against criticism that his statements have been inconsistent.The campaign said in a statement that at the outset, Biden advised that the United States should first obtain additional confirmation that bin Laden was at the compound. Biden, the campaign said, never proposed stopping the operation. Obama-era officials said Biden expressed skepticismBiden’s claim that he told Obama to ""go"" conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books. (A Trump campaign spokesman, Zach Parkinson, tweeted many of these passages.)Obama’s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in ""Hard Choices"" that Biden ""remained skeptical.""Panetta wrote in ""Worthy Fights"" that Biden ""argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.""Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War"" that he and Biden were the ""two primary skeptics.""""Biden’s primary concern was the political consequences of failure,"" Gates wrote.  Our rulingWhen Doocy asked Biden ""Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?"" Biden replied ""No, I didn’t. I didn’t.""Biden has created confusion with different accounts about what he told Obama. In 2012, Biden said he told Obama ""don’t go."" Biden said he wanted Obama to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound. Other Obama-era officials confirm that Biden was skeptical of the mission. In 2015, Biden said that he later told Obama privately, ""I thought he should go, but to follow his own instincts.""Biden’s answer to Doocy is hardly the full story and misses critical context.

They faced off in 2016. On Twitter this weekend, Goodwin cast himself as the more serious and experienced candidate, having held the office from 2009 to 2017. Causey was the first Republican to be elected to the office this century, when he won election in 2016.In a tweet, Goodwin referred to Causey as a ""30 (year) perennial candidate for (the) same office.""It takes a lot of money and energy to run one campaign, much less multiple campaigns over the course of three decades. That level of commitment is uncommon.So we wondered: how many times has Causey run for insurance commissioner over the last 30 years?There have been seven elections for Insurance Commissioner since 1990. Causey, who has a background in the insurance industry, ran in many of them -- but not all of them.Race historyHere’s a look back each race for Insurance Commissioner over the last 30 years, and whether Causey participated.Note: Goodwin should’ve known a little about the Republican in the 2008 election, since he won the seat by beating a different candidate -- John Odom.If Causey follows through with his plan to run for re-election in 2020 (he already filed to run), he’ll have run in six of the last eight elections, or 75 percent of them.Other campaignsGoodwin specifically noted Causey’s history of running for the ""same"" office. This could be interpreted to mean Causey has only ever run for one office. That’s not the case. Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021In 2014, Causey ran for Congress in the 6th Congressional District. But he didn’t make the November ballot, having placed seventh in the Republican primary that May.He also ran for state Senate in 2002, the race in District 28 to Democrat Katie Dorsett.Goodwin has some other races on his record, too. In 2004, he lost a bid to unseat Republican Cherie Berry as Labor Commissioner. Two years before that, he won an NC House race. And in 1996, Goodwin was elected to the NC House after running unopposed.Another meaningFinally, let’s look at the term ""perennial candidate."" The word can be a bit squishy, as an Ohio newspaper columnist once pointed out.Goodwin told us he used the term only to communicate that Causey has run frequently, and in that sense he’s right. He also pointed out that, if had intended to say Causey ran in every election since 1990, he would’ve used the word ""quadrennial"" -- meaning someone who runs every four years.However, used in the context of politics, the term ""perennial candidate"" often refers to candidates who don’t have much of a shot at winning. Major media outlets have used the term not only to describe someone who runs frequently -- but someone who almost always loses, and runs despite having questionable qualifications and/or low odds of winning. NPR in 2011 used the term to describe frequent presidential candidates U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, and Alan Keyes. The Associated Press has used the term to describe a Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi who once promised to establish a series of snow-cone stands to fund state services. The AP used the term again in 2019 to describe a ""cult-like figure"" and conspiracy theorist who ran one of his several presidential campaigns from prison.Causey’s different from most candidates because he’s won elected office, represented a major political party in the five elections he didn’t win, and has a background in the insurance industry.Our rulingGoodwin referred to Causey as a 30-year ""perennial candidate"" for the ""same office."" He’s got a point: Causey has run for insurance commissioner a lot since 1992. Those familiar with the term’s use in political circles may find the description off-base when applied to Causey. But Goodwin’s claim is mostly accurate. It just needs a little clarification and additional information.We rate it Mostly True.","https://twitter.com/WayneGoodwinNC/status/1205966475628023809?s=20,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article237070179.html,https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/04/2008&county_id=0&office=COS&contest=0,https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/Elections/2020/Candidate%20Filing/2020%20state%20candidate%20list_by%20contest.pdf,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/blog-posting/no-facebook-didnt-try-shut-down-gavin-newsom-recal/,https://www.wwaytv3.com/2014/01/01/mike-causey-running-for-cobles-nc-congress-seat/,https://www.toledoblade.com/JackLessenberry/2015/10/18/Perennial-candidate-description-needs-to-be-retired/stories/20151018164,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quadrennial,https://www.npr.org/2011/09/23/140701113/also-rans-what-drives-the-perennial-candidates,https://apnews.com/aa74ab04aab146478e9ba448efb13292,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/political-extremist-perennial-candidate-lyndon-larouche-dead-at-96/",,"Elections,North Carolina,Wayne Goodwin",,,,,

And it seems like everybody, both parties, have been threatening aid, if some kind of investigation either doesn't happen or is ended. And so I think, really, what's going to happen is people are going to say, ‘Oh, they're impeaching President Trump for exactly the same thing that Joe Biden did.’""Paul continued:""He threatened the aid, if they didn't fire someone.

""The motivations of then-Vice President Biden clearly could have included shielding his family and their oligarch patron from scrutiny, yet this is dismissed because of bias. ""What the evidence shows about Biden’s actionsPaul’s reference to Biden threatening aid stems from when Biden called for Ukraine to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015.Many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of the ruling class.  Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 13, 2021 in a text postDonald Trump's second impeachment ""cost $33 million.""By Daniel Funke • February 19, 2021A frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. At a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden recounted his threat to then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and from then-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.""I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,"" Biden recounted. ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""The big point: On top of the international support for what he did, Biden was representing the views of the U.S. government and its foreign policy analysts.What the evidence shows about Trump’s actionsPaul’s reference to Trump threatening aid if Ukraine didn’t investigate someone stems from a July 25 phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenksy.According to a readout of the call published by the White House on Sept. 25, Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden and his family’s dealings in Ukraine. Trump said: ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.""The withholding of the aid while asking a foreign leader to investigate a potential political rival is at the heart of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump told Zelensky that he would have his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr call him.Trump temporarily froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine before their July 25 phone call. The frozen aid was released Sept. 11, after Trump’s call became publicly known.During the phone call, Trump said ""a lot of people are talking about"" the removal of a ""very fair prosecutor"" in Ukraine. We rated that statement False.A complaint by the whistleblower lodged to the inspector general of the intelligence community stated that other White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the phone call. They discussed how to treat the phone call because they had believed Trump was using his position for personal gain.Our rulingPaul said Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president ""sounds exactly like what Joe Biden did.""Paul equated the actions of Trump and Biden, but they are not the same. Biden threatened to withhold aid unless Ukraine fired a prosecutor who was widely viewed as corrupt — in line with U.S. and international policy. Trump, by contrast, temporarily froze aid and then asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, his potential 2020 political rival. We rate this statement False.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCN0C9ciic,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/rand-paul/,https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-november-10-2019-n1079501,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/democratic-rep-himes-accuses-republicans-false-equivalency-between-trump-biden-n1079456,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/sep/27/politifacts-trump-ukraine-biden-coverage-one-place/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-ad-misleads-about-biden-ukraine-and-prosecut/,https://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/24/joe-biden-is-at-the-center-of-us-diplomacy-in-ukraine/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trumps-boasts-about-former-ukrainian-prosec/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/trumps-second-impeachment-did-not-cost-33-million/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/24/full-trump-ukraine-timeline-now/,https://www.cfr.org/event/foreign-affairs-issue-launch-former-vice-president-joe-biden,https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6429027/White-House-Transcript-2019.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/07/us-aid-ukraine-donald-trump-froze-one-chart/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/03/timeline-trump-impeachment-inquiry/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trumps-boasts-about-former-ukrainian-prosec/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/sep/26/read-declassified-whistleblower-complaint-ukraine-/",,"National,Impeachment,Rand Paul",,,,,

""They have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills.""Shields’ claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among conservative pundits and Republican lawmakers as the House continues its probe into Trump’s actions on Ukraine.The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times, which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws. But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed. In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump’s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he ""misspoke,"" and he later clarified his point on Twitter. ""I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,"" he told us. Mea Culpa - I misspoke on @TheLeadCNN yesterday when I said House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have passed bills. It's more subpoenas than they have had laws *passed/signed*. Still a valid point about their wasted majority but want to be accurate https://t.co/I1k5aMe3no— Mike Shields (@mshields007) November 1, 2019 Even this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it’s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation.Counting House-backed laws can be misleadingThe Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article’s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry.The report’s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued approximately 47 in total, adding that many were due to ""stonewalling of the current administration and Trump’s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas.""Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on February 9, 2021 in an article“Manipulated Video used in House Impeachment Looks to Have VIOLATED House Rules”By Noah Y. Kim • February 11, 2021Etienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton’s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas.The Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 46 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that’s accurate: There are 43 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump.But Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate.That’s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. ""But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,"" Tauberer said.Not only that, but the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning ""the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,"" he said.This year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 66 bills that earned Trump’s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi’s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new law and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws. The House can’t make laws by itselfExperts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate’s role in sending House-backed bills to the president’s desk.""The House can't pass ‘bills into law’ by itself,"" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.According to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn’t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats’ progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to ""think of me as the grim reaper.""The GOP doesn’t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however. ""We are talking about two completely different processes,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. ""A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount.""Of course, Shields’ botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn’t true.Our rulingShields said Democrats ""have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills.""That’s wrong, and Shields clarified his point on Twitter. But the claim that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes.We rate this statement False.","http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1910/31/cg.02.html,https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1187120236656578561?s=20,https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1187027780157853696?s=20,https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1189952133594046464?s=20,https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1189622762983301120?s=20,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/22/nancy-pelosi-democrats-produce-more-subpoenas-laws/,https://twitter.com/mshields007/status/1190295838070886401?s=20,https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/I1k5aMe3no,https://twitter.com/mshields007/status/1190295838070886401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/09/impeachment-trump-who-has-been-subpoenaed/3912226002/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/04/us/politics/president-trump-impeachment-inquiry.html,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/blog-posting/no-house-democrats-impeachment-video-did-not-viola/,https://wayback.archive-it.org/4949/20141031200116/http:/oversight-archive.waxman.house.gov/documents/20060117103516-91336.pdf,https://www.congress.gov/public-laws/116th-congress,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?status=28,29,32,33&sort=-current_status_date#current_status[]=28,https://www.congress.gov/public-laws/116th-congress,https://www.congress.gov/advanced-search/legislation?congresses[0]=116&legislationNumbers=&restrictionType=field&restrictionFields[0]=allBillTitles&restrictionFields[1]=summary&summaryField=billSummary&enterTerms=&wordVariants=true&legislationTypes[0]=hr&legislationTypes[1]=hres&legislationTypes[2]=hjres&legislationTypes[3]=hconres&legislationTypes[4]=hamdt&legislationTypes[5]=s&legislationTypes[6]=sres&legislationTypes[7]=sjres&legislationTypes[8]=sconres&legislationTypes[9]=samdt&legislationTypes[10]=suamdt&public=true&private=true&chamber=all&actionTerms=&legislativeActionWordVariants=true&dateOfActionOperator=equal&dateOfActionStartDate=&dateOfActionEndDate=&dateOfActionIsOptions=yesterday&dateOfActionToggle=multi&legislativeAction=149&sponsorState=One&member=&sponsorTypes[0]=sponsor&sponsorTypes[1]=sponsor&sponsorTypeBool=OR&committeeActivity[0]=0&committeeActivity[1]=3&committeeActivity[2]=11&committeeActivity[3]=12&committeeActivity[4]=4&committeeActivity[5]=2&committeeActivity[6]=5&committeeActivity[7]=9&satellite=[]&search=&submitted=Submitted&searchResultViewType=expanded&q=%7B%22congress%22:%22all%22%7D&pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Adesc,https://www.nbcnews.com/video/mcconnell-says-he-will-be-grim-reaper-to-democrats-legislation-63796293974",,"Congress,Impeachment,PunditFact,Mike Shields",,,,,

Darden owns multiple restaurant chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s and The Capital Grille.We went to OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database run by the Center for Responsive Politics research group, to examine the numbers.The database shows that Darden Restaurants itself has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign, nor has it made any contributions during the 2020 election cycle. (The same goes for the 2018 and 2016 election cycles.)That’s because corporations are prohibited from making contributions to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. Open Secrets includes a similar disclaimer that reads: ""Organizations themselves cannot contribute to candidates and party committees. Totals include subsidiaries and affiliates.""But donations can be made from PACs affiliated with the company, from the organization’s employees, owners or those individuals’ immediate family members. All the money associated with Darden that’s been donated so far in the 2020 cycle has come from individuals, the database shows. Those donations have totaled $17,332, with $11,899 of that going to candidates, all of them Democrats, and $5,000 going to a PAC that says it supports Democratic leadership. Trump is not among the recipients so far, according to the database.In recent election cycles, however, contributions associated with the organization went to both Republican and Democratic candidates and committees, and came from both individuals and PACs.

He recommended other treatments such as regular exercise, avoiding exacerbating drugs like antihistamines, antidepressants; increasing iron levels if they are low, and avoiding alcohol.Doctors Hope Ricciotti and Hye-Chun Hur also wrote for Harvard Medical School about the lack of science behind the tonic water method and list other ways people can alleviate RLS symptoms: ""Drinking a few ounces of tonic water shouldn't be harmful, but it isn't likely to prevent your leg cramps."" They instead recommend ""making sure to get enough fluids, avoiding caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, stretching during the day or before bed, and, when a cramp starts, standing on the affected leg, applying ice or heat and gently massaging the affected muscle.""Our rulingA Facebook post claims that drinking a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed can help alleviate symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome.It’s not considered harmful to consume a glass of tonic water, but the home remedy is not scientifically proven to help with RLS.

But he also touched on protecting gay rights, gun ownership and freedom of religion. Trump put forth the United States as a pillar of religious toleration, speaking of the ""ironclad American commitment"" to protecting religious freedom.""Hard to believe, but 80% of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed,"" Trump said Sept 24. ""We want and support religious liberty for all.""There’s some substance to Trump’s statistic, but it relies on the broadest definition of threats to religion.How broad?Well, in the underlying analysis, the United States itself was included as having having high rankings for one type of intolerance and ended in the same category as places such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.Let’s unpack the number.A business group crunches the numbersThe 80% figure shows up in a summary by the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation, an organization that promotes interfaith understanding and aims to show business leaders that ""religious freedom is good for business.""The group looked at countries with high levels of governmental restrictions or social hostility rooted in religion and added up their populations. The country list came from the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of data.""Pew Research Center data show that the number of people living in countries with high religious restrictions and hostilities has reached nearly six billion people, or 78.5% of the world's total population in 2017,"" the group’s president wrote in a presentation.The math is correct, and supports Trump’s claim. But a closer look at the Pew study shows why a dose of caution applies.The Pew studyThe Pew Research Center’s most recent survey of religious restrictions looked at two types of problems: government actions, and actions by individuals or groups, which it called social hostility.Jeremy Barker with the Religious Freedom Institute, a group that advocates for religious liberty, told us that when interpreting the findings, ""additional nuance is required.""""While the total population of these countries is 6.3 billion, the restrictions may not evenly affect these people,"" Barker said.Especially in the area of social hostility, all it takes is a handful of bad actors to put a country on a list of nations with relatively poor rankings.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021In the government category, the report found that out of 198 countries, 52 had high or very high levels of governmental restrictions on religion.In the very worst cases, government agents had arrested or detained people for reasons of their faith. The top offenders were China, Iran, Malaysia and Syria, and countries such as Russia and Indonesia ranked in the top 10. The Pew analysis had separate rankings for social hostility. Those included such acts as harassing women for the clothes they wear, religious violence by organized groups, and hate crimes by individuals. These can take place beyond the best efforts of governments to stop them.It ranked 56 countries as showing high or very high social hostilities. India was at the very top, followed by Syria, Iraq and Egypt. With rising tensions in Europe tied to refugees, Denmark, Germany and Italy also appeared there. But so did the United States. It received higher rankings due to incidents such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where marchers chanted ""Jews will not replace us,"" and a fatal stabbing in Portland, Ore., when a man shouted anti-Muslim remarks to two women, one of whom was wearing a hijab.While Trump exhorted other nations to match the commitment of the United States, his statistic included the United States and other nations with a tradition for protecting religious rights.Combining the lists of governmental restrictions and social hostility, the report found that 83 individual nations ranked high in at least one or the other. Their combined population is close to 6 billion, of which the U.S. population is a part. That is the source of the 80% figure Trump cited.Shaun Casey, director of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, said the 80% figure distorts the Pew report.""The president is looking for a riveting number that says religious intolerance is on fire,"" Casey said. ""And you look at the data and it’s not true.""Barker warned that a few countries have an outsized impact.""Because a few large countries are included in this — India, China, Indonesia, etc. — the population share is very high compared to the raw number of countries.""Anna Schiller, a Pew spokeswoman, said the center includes many variables but doesn’t rank them by severity or importance.""We leave it up to our readers to form their own opinion based on the analysis we provide,"" Schiller said.Our rulingTrump said that 80% of the world’s people live in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or completely outlawed.Ultimately, that is based on an independent group’s list of countries with what it deems high or very high levels of governmental or social intolerance of certain religions.

The United States shows up on one list, as do several other Western democracies.There is no simple way to capture the experience of religious minorities.

But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""",,politifact,,"In a recent New York Times opinion column, dietitian Christy Harrison, an ""intuitive eating coach"" and author, responded to a fellow clinician who had questioned some of her thoughts on the link between being overweight and developing other medical conditions.Harrison noted that although most health professionals have been taught that higher body mass index (BMI) causes poor health outcomes, she wrote, ""unfortunately, that just isn’t true.""She added: ""We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""We decided to investigate the point she was making, which is at the center of a larger, often-heated debate about whether it is possible to be overweight and healthy at the same time — a perspective advocated by the ""Health at Every Size"" movement, of which Harrison is a part. With nearly 72% of U.S. adults considered overweight or obese, this is a pressing issue.When we reached out to Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as her main sources.The first, a 2011 piece published in the Nutrition Journal, argues it might be better to shift away from weight-loss efforts to improving health in other ways that are weight-neutral.Its lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, wrote ""Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,"" a 2010 book embraced by ""fat acceptance"" advocates.It addresses Harrison’s first point with this: ""While it is well established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causation is less well-established.""The other paper, a 2014 piece in the Journal of Obesity, makes similar arguments.Causation, correlation, association: Let’s unpack thatThere is an old saw used by most statisticians: Correlation does not equal causation.But what does that mean? Let’s use a fake example: Some people have trouble seeing at night. Turns out all those people ate carrots. Ergo, there could be a correlation between people who ate carrots and those who experienced night vision problems.That doesn't prove anything else, though, such as causation. Correlation is necessary when trying to determine causation, but doesn’t prove it.  ""Epidemiological studies never show causation, only association,"" said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.To establish cause, epidemiologists need more evidence. The best way, considered the ""gold standard,"" is to randomly assign people to one group or another ― feeding one group carrots and withholding carrots from the other. Researchers would then monitor any difference in how many people develop night vision problems.That’s nifty, but not always possible or ethical. One could not, for example, randomly assign some people to a group and then cause them to become overweight.  Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those that compare groups of people who already have the characteristic — say, carrot eating or being overweight — with those who don’t to see if patterns emerge.They use methods to control for things that might affect the results, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes and other factors. Then they can estimate how strong of an association or correlation they see.With smoking and lung cancer, very strong associations were seen, leading to the conclusion that, yes, smoking causes lung cancer. But does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep apnea or joint problems?""With the case of weight, the associations are much weaker,"" said Kendrin Sonneville, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post“WHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 1, 2021So on this point, Henderson’s statement holds up. Current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes, but it does not definitively establish causation.But others, especially clinicians, say there is little doubt that being overweight strongly raises the risk of developing such health problems.""This isn’t up for debate,"" said Dr. Harold Bays, chief science officer for the Obesity Medicine Association, which represents practitioners who treat overweight patients.""The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of adverse metabolic and other health consequences,"" he said.A 2018 Endocrine Society scientific statement, for example, looked across many studies of overweight and obesity, concluding that the two contribute to ""type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others.""Then things get murky.Bays and the other experts agreed that some people who are overweight might not develop other conditions.""It is absolutely true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fatty liver are due to obesity,"" said Bays.They acknowledged that people who fall into the category of being obese or overweight may even appear healthy metabolically — at least for a while.But there’s also a caution.""If you say, ‘Wait a minute, is their blood sugar where we want it … aren’t their triglycerides a little high and what about their blood pressure?’ And that’s not even to mention pain to the joints or sleep apnea,"" Bays said. ""When you drill down, very few people would truly meet the criteria of being metabolically healthy but obese, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority are going to have something.""What about stigma?There’s been less research around Harrison’s second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with being obese or overweight are caused instead by the stigma heavy people face, or the yo-yo effect of dieting, losing weight and then gaining it back again, in regular cycles.She pointed to research included in the paper by Bacon reporting that weight cycling could lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The research, however, found associations though not specific causation.Similarly, in another study Harrison provided, people who reported weight discrimination ― 6% of the sample studied — had twice the risk of physiological stress over nearly 10 years. Such stress can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the study said.But most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling.While those two things can factor into health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes seen by her patients, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.Stanford also takes issue with advocates who promote the idea that being overweight isn’t a big health risk factor.""The Health at Every Size movement goes against what we know about obesity as a disease,"" Stanford said. ""Their aim in that movement is to not learn the science.""Our rulingHarrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes ""just isn’t true"" ― adding that ""we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing ""correlation"" is a different finding than causation. However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions. But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions.We rate Harrison’s statement as Mostly False.","https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/kids-weight-watchers.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm,https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-10-9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4132299/,https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-researchers-mean-by/observational-vs-experimental-studies,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/blog-posting/who-did-not-say-you-dont-need-wear-mask/,https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/2/79/4922247,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5253095/",,"Health Care,Public Health,Health Check,Christy Harrison",,,,,

One way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently."" The climate researchers we reached said Warren’s term was off the mark. Where they differed was on the significance. In contrast to Reilly, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said he didn’t find it to be a major issue.As it turns out, Warren has used the 70% figure in a couple of ways that are more accurate, without saying ""industries.""Earlier during the town hall, Warren said she wanted to focus on ""the three areas where we get the most carbon pollution in America right now.""""They're in our buildings and homes, right? What we're burning. It's our cars and light-duty trucks that we drive. And it's the generation of electricity where we're still using a lot of carbon-based fuel to make that happen."" Eliminating the carbon footprint in all three by 2035 would, she said, ""cut 70% of the carbon that we are currently spewing into the air.""That’s a slightly different mix of sources, and based on the EPA numbers, they add up to the reduction Warren claimed.In her $1 trillion clean energy plan that Warren posted a day before the town hall, she was fully accurate. ""Electricity, transportation, buildings, and related commercial activity are responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. carbon emissions,"" she wrote.Our rulingWarren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air.

But those are activities, not industries. Individual Americans as well as companies contribute to the situation in ways that are often intertwined.Warren herself has been more accurate in her energy plan and even during the town hall itself.

No Republicans signed it.Additionally, Anderson and other Democrats have asked Vos to refrain from calling overnight floor sessions that aren’t an emergency and that an ADA coordinator be assigned to determine which accommodation requests should be granted. The day after the story appeared, Vos told conservative radio host Jay Weber on 1130 WISN the timing of the request was fishy, since it aligned with his new position as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""The fact that they launched this during the same week I got to become the president of the nation’s largest bipartisan organization called the National Conference of State Legislatures, first person from Wisconsin, does not seem like an accident to me,"" Vos told Weber on Aug. 15, 2019. ""Everything they do is political and based on trying to make the other side look bad.""Vos told Weber he felt that lawmakers phoning in to meetings was disrespectful, because they are paid to be present. Additionally, Vos said, you wouldn’t be able to be sure they were really paying attention if they phoned in.Vos has said Anderson could listen to recordings of hearings and meetings he may miss, but that he would not be able to phone into them so he could participate and vote.So, Vos has claimed the accommodations request from Anderson and the Democrats was timed to embarrass him.We decided to take a closer look at the timeline of what happened.The timelineAnderson’s office provided a Jan. 23, 2019, email that Anderson sent to the chief of staff for Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, as the starting point. Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021That email, sent by Anderson at 12:55 p.m., asked that any meeting of the Assembly have 24-hour notice; that none extend beyond 24 hours; that all be held within reasonable hours; and that individuals with disabilities be allowed to attend by phone or teleconference.Here is a summary of what happened next:Feb. 7, 2019: Through a formal negotiation, or Memorandum of Understanding over rules for the session, Democrats bring the requests to Republican state leaders in further detail.April 16, 2019: GOP leaders reject Anderson’s request to call into sessions and meetings and that the Assembly recess no later than 10 p.m., reconvening the following day if debate went longer. Republicans say they would try to limit meetings to 12 hours and said if they were expected to go longer, would provide appropriate notice to members. This is based on a document outlining the negotiations provided by Anderson’s office.May 15, 2019: Democrats say the 12-hour parameters, and not allowing Anderson to call into meetings, do not address accessibility concerns.May 31, 2019: Anderson contacts reporter Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. May 31, 2019: Marley asks Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer what Vos thinks of lawmakers being able to call into meetings, if he would introduce a policy that allows it and, if not, why not.June 4, 2019: Beyer responds to Marley saying Assembly rules don’t allow members to phone into committees and Vos does not support changing the rule.July 29, 2019: The Journal Sentinel publishes a story that describes the dispute after Vos tells the newspaper he thinks it is ""disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone.""Aug. 8, 2019: The Democrats send their letter to Republican leadership. That same day, Vos becomes president of NCSL.The story about the Aug. 8 letter -- and a suggestion by Anderson that he may file a lawsuit -- was published a week later. That story is what prompted Vos’ claim on the Jay Weber show that it was -- in essence -- a move timed to embarrass him.But the timeline shows that Anderson’s efforts began almost immediately after he took office in January 2019 -- nearly seven months before Vos took the post in question.Vos’ office did not respond to requests from PolitiFact.Our rulingVos claimed the accommodation request for Anderson was timed to embarrass him as he took over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But records show the effort began months and months earlier.We rate Vos’ claim False.","https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/14/no-gop-lawmakers-sign-on-to-letter-supporting-paralyzed-democrat/2007713001/,https://newstalk1130.iheart.com/content/2019-08-15-vos-joins-jay-weber-evers-gun-law-meeting-foxconn-and-rep-jimmy-anderson/,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/29/leaders-wont-let-lawmaker-who-uses-wheelchair-phone-into-meetings/1830851001/",,"Disability,Legal Issues,Wisconsin,Robin Vos",,,,,

Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, has offered a compromise red-flag bill that would take firearms away from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others.While the gun-control debate has largely focused on stopping mass shootings, Miyares says the biggest value of his bill could be that it would stop some people from shooting themselves.""On average, 65% of all gun deaths in America are from suicides,"" he said during an August 14 interview on The John Frederick Show, a conservative radio broadcast. ""...This is one step we could do, in my opinion, to prevent people from harming themselves. ""It’s not just about some of the mass carnage.""We fact-checked his claim that suicides account for 65 percent of gun deaths in the U.S. The latest information comes from an annual report issued in June 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study is called, ""Deaths, Final Data for 2017.""According to the data, there were 38,882 deaths by firearms in 2017, and 23,854 were suicides. That comes to 61.4% - a little lower than Miyares’ figure.In addition to suicides, the statistics showed 14,542 of the gun deaths (37.4%)  were murders, and 486 were accidental (1.2%).Because Miyares began his statement saying ""on average,"" we computed 10 years of statistics - from 2008 through 2017.

That’s a 62% average - again, a little lower than Miyares figure. Over 10 years, the CDC reported 335,746 gun deaths, and 208,287 were suicides. That’s 62%.We asked Miyares for the source of his 65% claim, and he sent us a magazine article that ran in The Atlantic on Dec. 21, 2018.

The number of yearly suicides increased by 36 percent - from 18,223 to 23,8545. Annual suicides by guns increased 30 percent, from 18,223 to 23,854.Red-flag laws A number of Virginia legislators - most of them Democrats - have called for a red-flag law, predicting it would reduce gun violence. At least 15 states have enacted such measures.  In Virginia, Democrats offered a bill this winter that would have allowed law-enforcement officials to ask a judge to declare a person a ""substantial risk"" to himself or others and order police to seize his guns for up 14 days. Sometime within that period, the person would have been entitled to a hearing to refute charges. If the judge found the charges credible, he could have ordered the guns held for renewable 180-day periods.Republicans controlling a House subcommittee defeated the bill on a 4-2 vote. Gun enthusiasts complained the measure allowed guns to be taken without due process.Miyares says his bill addresses that concern. It would require a person to be evaluated by a mental health expert and appear before a judge, with a chance to defend himself, before his firearms could be taken away for renewable 14-day periods. The General Assembly is expected to consider the measure in November.Our rulingMiyares, in promoting his red-flag bill, said, ""On average, 65% of gun deaths in America are from suicides.""His figure slightly overstates a sad situation.

Tammy Baldwin said in a June 24, 2019, tweet. ""More Americans are uninsured today than when (President Donald) Trump took office.""Is Baldwin correct? Are more Americans uninsured today than when Trump took office? Let’s take a look.The evidenceWhen asked to back up the statement, Baldwin’s staff provided a list of links to academic studies, polls and media reports. In many cases, the headlines tell the story:— Jan. 23, 2019, Gallup report: ""U.S. Uninsured Rate Rises to Four-Year High.""— April 25, 2019, Georgetown University Health Policy Institute: ""Updated CBO Estimates Find Uninsured Increased by 1.4 Million Between 2016 and 2018.""— Jan. 23, 2019, Forbes: ""Uninsured rate hits four-year high amid Trump’s Obamacare attacks."" — May 9, 2019, USA Today: ""CDC: 1.1 million more American lost health insurance coverage in 2018."" — Jan. 23, 2019, Los Angeles Times: ""Uninsured rate under Trump surges to highest level since Obamacare began."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics report on health insurance shows there were 28.6 million people uninsured in 2016, the year before Trump took office. That represents 9% of the population.In 2018, that number showed 30.4 million people, or 9.4% of people all ages were without insurance. Featured Fact-checkGordon Hintzstated on February 5, 2021 in TV interview“We know mask mandates work.

So, Baldwin is in the ball park with the ""more Americans"" part of the statement. But her claim ties the reduction in those with insurance to actions by Trump and his administration. How does she fare in that regard?Administration actionsTrump campaigned on the issue of repealing the ACA. Since taking office in January of 2017, his administration has steadily taken steps to roll back the law.On Jan. 20, 2017, Trump issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to use their administrative powers to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act ""to the maximum extent permitted by law."" Currently, a federal appeals court in New Orleans has taken up the Affordable Care Act case, Texas v. United States, which has been brought by Republican-led states. A lower court judge already ruled the health law unconstitutional. The case could wind up before the Supreme Court, which in 2012 upheld the law saying its requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty was covered by Congress’ ability to levy taxes.Meanwhile, a July 7, 2019 CNN article headlined ""5 ways Trump is undermining Obamacare without the courts"" noted the administration has:Made it harder to sign up: That is, Trump cut the enrollment period in half and cut advertising about how to sign up.Broadened access to alternative plans: An October 2017 executive order allows more people to buy cheaper policies -- though ones with less coverage and fewer protections.Made enrollees pay more: Among other factors, moves that change how some of the law's provisions are adjusted every year mean policyholders will have to pay 2.5% more out of pocket.Let states alter Obamacare:  States, including Wisconsin, have applied for waivers so they do not have to apply parts of the law.Required Medicaid recipients to work: As the CNN article notes: ""The Trump administration is allowing states to require certain Medicaid enrollees -- particularly those who gained coverage under Obamacare -- to work in order to continue receiving benefits.""Meanwhile, on March 28, 2019, PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro, who said Trump’s health care policies have ""left millions more Americans uninsured since he took office.""Castro’s claim specifically said ""millions,"" which differs from Baldwin’s much more general claim. At the time, the number was actually closer to 1.3 million. PolitiFact National concluded Castro had the trend right, but his numbers wrong, and rated his claim Half True.Our rulingBaldwin said ""more Americans are uninsured today than when Trump took office."" Census Bureau statistics show that there was a steady decline in the number of uninsured Americans following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- a trend that reversed and began ticking upward under Trump.We rate Baldwin’s statement True.","https://www.kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/,https://twitter.com/SenatorBaldwin/status/1143171195732447232,https://news.gallup.com/poll/246134/uninsured-rate-rises-four-year-high.aspx,https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2019/04/25/updated-cbo-estimates-find-uninsured-increased-by-1-4-million-between-2016-and-2018/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/01/23/uninsured-rate-hits-four-year-high-amid-trumps-obamacare-attacks/#5fd6429616c6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/09/health-insurance-1-1-million-more-americans-lost-coverage-2018/1140304001/,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-uninsured-poll-20190123-story.html,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/Insur201808.pdf,/personalities/gordon-hintz/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/gordon-hintz/wisconsin-assembly-minority-leader-right-relations/,https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/affordable-care-act-under-trump-administration,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Executive_Order_13765.pdf,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/09/739653482/the-affordable-care-act-is-back-in-court-5-facts-you-need-to-know,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/07/politics/donald-trump-undermines-obamacare-without-courts/index.html,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/mar/28/julian-castro/rise-uninsured-under-trump-tops-1-million-beware-e/",,"Health Care,Public Health,Wisconsin,Tammy Baldwin",,,,,

Ron Tusler was on Facebook claiming mass shootings are down under President Donald Trump.""Less mass shootings under Trump! His base doesn't hate anyone,"" declared Tusler, R-Harrison, in a since-deleted post.The text accompanied a re-posting of a chart shared by another person that showed 24 mass shootings under President Barack Obama and four shootings under Trump.That’s quite the disparity. There’s a lot to cover — and a lot wrong — in this seemingly simple claim. Let’s break it down.Claim based on flawed, outdated dataTusler’s claim is ridiculous on multiple fronts.For one, the data it references is badly outdated. The chart in Tusler’s post is pulled from a Spring 2018 article in National Affairs, a quarterly journal from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation after the El Paso, Dayton shootingsThe chart says it pulled the tallies for each president from an LA Times timeline published in October 2017, then added the February 2018 Marjory Stoneman school shooting in Parkland, Fla.So the data at best ends a year and a half ago, reflecting less than half of Trump’s time in office to date.The chart itself is flawed as well. Converting the LA Times narratives to a chart implies a degree of consistency and comprehensiveness that the newspaper did not intend. The article didn’t define any criteria for inclusion aside from a sentence at the top saying, ""Here are some of the most notable mass shootings in the U.S. in recent decades.""The National Affairs chart is particularly haphazard since it added in the Florida shooting but ignored the Texas First Baptist Church massacre in November 2017 that killed more people.Mass shootings increase over timeThe broader issue with both the chart and Tusler’s claim is the use of raw numbers to compare one partial term under Trump to two full terms under Obama.Simple tallies will, of course, be larger over a longer time period.So what are those tallies? And how does Tusler’s claim about less shootings hold up to a better comparison, such as mass shootings per year?Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Those answers depend on how you define a mass shooting.Though bandied about in politics, media and culture, there is no universally accepted definition of the term. The U.S. Justice Department defines it as three or more killings in a single episode. The Washington Post database uses four or more shot and killed in a single incident, excluding gang-related killings. Mother Jones uses three or more shot and killed. The much broader Gun Violence Archive uses four or more shot (not necessarily killed). None include the perpetrator in those tallies.We turned to the Washington Post and Mother Jones, since both have been tracking this subject in detail and have data going back several presidential administrations.We find a trend line that doesn’t match up with particular presidents or party control, it simply shows a steady increase in shootings over time. Our analysis of The Washington Post data shows an average of 2.4 mass shootings per year under President Ronald Reagan, 2.3 under George H. W. Bush and 3.6 under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The rate jumps to 5.1 per year under Obama and 7.9 per year so far under Trump — a roughly 50% increase.In terms of raw numbers, that’s 41 shootings in the eight years Obama was in office, compared to 20 already in the two and a half under Trump.The data from Mother Jones shows a similar trend, though the numbers are different since they have a broader definition of mass shootings and aren’t as comprehensive as the Post in prior years. Mother Jones reports 1 to 2 shootings per year from the Reagan era through George W. Bush, then 4.8 under Obama and 11.5 under Trump.(The Gun Violence Archive doesn’t shed much light on this claim since it only goes back to 2014.)We asked Tusler if he was aware the data was outdated, and whether he felt raw numbers were a fair way to compare Trump and Obama.""If there is newer data, please provide it and I would update. I prefer the most up to date information,"" he said in a Facebook message. ""I don't think raw numbers tell the whole story. But, at least they are not interpreted with a bias.""It’s an ironic response given that it’s the use of raw numbers that paints a skewed picture of the Trump and Obama eras. Doing an annual average equalizes the comparison.Tusler said he thought the data was more recent and had removed the post from Facebook, though it remained until this fact check published.Our rulingIn the wake of two mass shootings that left 31 dead in the span of 13 hours, Tusler claimed there have been fewer such shootings under Trump than Obama.That’s nonsense.The chart Tusler based his claim on is both incomplete and outdated — including only half of Trump’s time in office. And it’s absurd to use a raw tally of shootings to compare just over two years under Trump to eight years under Obama.Using more comprehensive data and a reasonable criterion like shootings per year, we see that mass shootings have risen steadily in recent decades regardless of who is in the White House. So shootings are up — not down — under Trump.We rate Tusler’s claim Pants on Fire.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/05/el-paso-recovers-historic-mass-shooting/1918329001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/04/dayton-shooting-ohio-oregon-district-el-paso-shooting/1914440001/,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1797,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/,https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/presidents-and-mass-shootings,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/article/2019/aug/05/fact-checking-misinformation-after-el-paso-dayton-/,http://timelines.latimes.com/deadliest-shooting-rampages/,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-112publ265/html/PLAW-112publ265.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.b92548d7ab89,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9o6uDO18sLxBqPwl_Gh9bnhW-ev_dABH83M5Vb5L8o/htmlview?sle=true,https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting",,"Guns,Wisconsin,Ron Tusler",,,,,

Warren, D-Mass., wrote. ""The Federal Reserve just reported that the manufacturing sector had a second straight quarter of decline, falling below Wall Street’s expectations.""Warren has her numbers right, and a range of stats point to a slowdown in manufacturing. The disagreement lies with what that cooling means, and whether the ""R"" word applies. Key takeaways• The technical definition of an overall economic recession was met when the industrial production index from the Federal Reserve fell for two quarters in a row.• But the number of manufacturing workers continues to climb.• Other indicators show manufacturing is growing, but slower than before.Mixed signalsIn July, the Federal Reserve released numbers showing that industrial production dropped at an annual rate of 1.2% in the second quarter, and that came on top of a decline in the first quarter. Technically, two back-to-back quarters of falling growth amounts to a recession.Warren’s post linked to a MarketWatch article, in which Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said, ""the sector is in recession.""But economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution said Warren’s phrasing goes too far.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021""Manufacturing is now in the midst of a significant slowdown, but it is too small today to associate with terms like recession,"" Bosworth said.Bosworth said manufacturing numbers bounce around much more than the U.S. GDP, the measure of the entire economy. The economy has grown continuously each year since 2010. As this chart shows, industrial production has gone up and down throughout that time. And the recent drop is, as Bosworth said, not unusually deep.Bosworth also noted that there’s a big difference between saying the entire economy is in recession and that a single sector is. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" to apply the same two-quarters definition to manufacturing.Another widely used measure for the health of the manufacturing sector comes from the Institute for Supply Management. It surveys companies and produces a monthly Purchasing Managers Index, where any score above 50 shows growth. That number has been falling, but at 51.7 for June, it remains in positive territory.Steve Blitz, chief economist at the investment advising firm TS Lombard points to that index as one sign that manufacturing is not in recession. And Blitz has others: Orders at U.S. factories went up $1 billion in June, he said.""A recession is not evident in profits, still positive, and not evident in employment — flat to growing,"" Blitz said.In June, the number of manufacturing workers went up 17,000, although it was basically flat for the three months before.Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that American manufacturing is being dragged down by weak demand around the world. On top of those global trends, participants in the Institute for Supply Management survey said the U.S.-China trade dispute and concerns about tariffs on Mexican goods had put a damper on activity.Our rulingWarren said the country is now in a manufacturing recession. Output has fallen for two quarters in a row, and some economists apply the recession label. But others do not; they say they’d need to see additional indicators of decline.They point to other data that shows manufacturing has slowed but continues to grow. Importantly, the sector continues to hire more workers and orders for goods rose by $1 billion in June.Warren has a point that manufacturing has weakened, but other information paints a more complicated picture.

Greg Steube, of Sarasota, warned on Twitter July 12 that Democrats struck a near-decade-old ban on using money to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. ""This means that terrorists who are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to a neighborhood near you,"" wrote Steube.Steube is right that the ban was removed in the House proposal.But he’s wrong to say that means the 40 detainees currently in Cuba could be coming here.Here’s why:• The House bill would only prohibit federal funds for additional detainees placed at Guantanamo Bay. Federal funding could still support the detainees already there;• The House bill calls for federal officials to submit a ""disposition plan"" to Congress about the detainees. But the disposition plan is just that, a plan. It doesn’t have to be carried out. And Guantanamo doesn’t have to be closed;• And because it matters, the White House says it will recommend that Trump veto the House bill if it were to reach his desk.What the House defense bill says about GuantanamoThe House voted 220-197 to pass the $733 billion National Defense Authorization Act for 2020. Republicans unanimously rejected the bill — and eight Democrats joined them — for multiple reasons including the Guantanamo provision and that it has $17 billion less than the Senate version. The House bill includes language that would prohibit ""use of funds for transfer to and detention of additional individuals"" at Guantanamo Bay on or after May 2, 2018. The Senate version extends the longstanding prohibition on using funds to transfer or release Gitmo detainees to the United States.If the House bill became law as is (the veto warning means it won’t), it wouldn’t apply to detainees currently there, said Charles ""Cully"" Stimson, who coordinated the Pentagon’s detention policy during President George W. Bush’s administration.""It doesn’t say you’ve got to get rid of the ones who are there,"" said Stimson, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.The bill also states that the attorney general and defense secretary submit a plan to Congress about how to proceed with each individual detained at Guantanamo Bay. That doesn’t necessarily mean they would be sent to facilities in the United States.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021Daphne Eviatar, an expert on detention at Amnesty International, said that a requirement to write a detention plan ""doesn’t require the administration to do anything except tell Congress what the plan is."" Steube’s spokeswoman, Rachel Harris, said Democrats blocked an effort to include a ban on using money to move detainees to the United States, which was standard language in past annual defense bills. Without a provision banning the use of funds to transfer detainees, they can be transferred at any time, Harris said. ""These detainees could end up in the United States at any number of facilities around the country that are located in American communities nationwide."" Stimson disagreed.""Just because the House fails to include that provision barring the use of funds to bring in detainees to the U.S. doesn’t automatically mean that, if it becomes law as passed, that the executive branch will make the decision to bring detainees from Gitmo to the U.S.,"" he said. ""There is a lot of green between the ball and the cup on this one.""Trump said in 2016 that ""we're going to load it up with bad dudes."" He hasn’t delivered on that goal — the population has essentially remained stagnant. But he has kept his promise to keep Guantanamo Bay open.Even if the government decided to empty Guantanamo Bay, it doesn’t mean that detainees would land at detention facilities in the United States. Detainees could be sent to their home countries, another country or the country where they were apprehended.""I don’t see any indication that anybody in the administration in the know has made the recommendation or push to have detainees brought to the U.S.,"" Stimson said. ""To the contrary, the question has been if the administration can bring additional detainees to Gitmo including ISIS. They are not looking to unload detainees at Gitmo, they are looking to load up.""Our rulingSteube said, ""Terrorists who are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to a neighborhood near you"" as a result of House Democrats’ actions on the National Defense Authorization Act.Democrats struck a near-decade-old ban on using money to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. But that doesn’t mean that the existing 40 detainees will be sent to facilities in the United States.A House bill said that federal funding could not be spent on additional detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay. The House bill directs officials to write a plan about how to proceed with the detainees.

Text written over the image claims that the individuals pictured are migrants.""The inescapable question is: How have all of you been able to pay your cell phone bills during your excruciating two month excursion across four separate countries?"" the post reads.The meme taps into the ongoing nationwide conversation about the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)The Rogue Patriot’s post, which amassed more than 1,200 shares, doesn’t list a source either in the meme or caption. And nothing in the photo makes it immediately obvious that those pictured are actually migrants.PolitiFact reached out to The Rogue Patriot for more information regarding the source of the image, and it directed us to an Associated Press story published March 27, 2017. The photo in question appears embedded in the text with the following caption:""Cubans check their cell phones inside the migrant shelter ‘Casa del Migrante’ in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas state, Mexico, Saturday, March 25, 2017, across the border from Laredo, Texas. The shelter limits migrants to one hour of cell phone usage, for security reasons.""The AP story addresses the so-called ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, which former president Barack Obama ended Jan. 12, 2017. That policy, created by former president Bill Clinton in 1995, allowed most Cubans who reached U.S. soil to become legal permanent residents after one year. Once it ended, Cuban migrants were treated the same as those from other countries.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021According to the AP’s reporting, many migrants in the Casa del Migrante shelter were Cubans who had tried to travel to the United States under the assumption that they would be included in the ""privileged path"" laid out by the Clinton-era policy. Several had jobs in Mexico that required them to leave the shelter ""to work in restaurants or on construction sites.""That’s a different context than that in which The Rogue Patriot posted its meme. The AP interviewed one migrant who had crossed several borders to get to Mexico, but based on the photo alone, it’s unclear which people pictured actually made a ""two-month excursion across four separate countries.""Similar versions of this meme have cropped up during previous news stories about immigration. In December, Snopes fact-checked a meme that used the same AP photo with a text overlay similar to The Rogue Patriot’s post. It found that the post was miscaptioned because it purported to show asylum seekers that were part of a caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U.S. border.Finally, we should note that it’s not unusual for poor people or even the homeless to possess cell phones, both in the United States and worldwide. The Gates Foundation, for example, has promoted the acquisition of mobile phones in Africa, Asia and Latin America in order to give low-income people in developing countries access to financial services through online banking. Our rulingThe Rogue Patriot claimed an image showed migrants are ""able to pay cell phone bills"" after a ""two-month excursion across four separate countries.""The photo was taken by the AP in 2017 for a story about Cuban immigrants who had been excluded from a Clinton-era amnesty policy.

(The Library of Congress has a digital file of the photo here.)In 1619, Hogan says in the thread, 100 ""poor English children"" between the ages of 8 and 16 were ""taken from the streets of London and sent to Virginia and sold into indentured servitude.

There, he explained more about the 100 English children sent to Virginia as part of the Poor Law that directed the children of paupers to work in the homes of other families as apprentices. Those that survived the journey to America, Hogan said, were to be apprentices for seven years. Certainly, said Michael Guasco, a history professor at Davidson College, there was forced transportation and convict servitude in the American colonies.""Certainly, things often did not work out well for people in these situations,"" he told us. ""Certainly, there were conversations about the use of slavery as a form of criminal punishment in England and some of the colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Mark Pocan, D-Madison, has been routinely tweeting out his support for the proposed Medicare for All Act, including this tweet from April 30, 2019:""The United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal healthcare. The #MedicareforAll Act ensures that every person living in the U.S. has access to healthcare and comprehensive benefits. Today's hearing is a historic step towards making it happen.""We decided to focus on the first part of the tweet. Is the United States the only industrialized country without universal health care?Let’s take a look.  What is the Medicare for All Act?In April 2019, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, unveiled an updated ""Medicare for All"" bill. Sanders’ plan would create a government-run system that would provide health care coverage to all Americans.According to an analysis by PolitiFact National, Medicare for All would replace private insurance, as well as Medicaid and Medicare. The Affordable Care Act would go away. A government-run health insurance program would replace them all. The veterans health system would stay in place, as would Indian Health Services.The new Medicare for All bill largely mirrors an earlier one, but this version fully covers long-term care. PolitiFact National has created a guide to Medicare for All that answers many questions about the program.The United States vs. other countriesIn June 2015, our colleagues at PolitiFact National checked a very similar claim from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate:""We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.""At that time, a spokesman said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 36 countries that includes Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and 26 more.The group does not include China and Russia, which the OECD classifies as ""emerging economies.""In its analysis, PolitiFact National cited a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries lacked universal health care coverage:Mexico had passed a law in 2004 with the goal of getting to universal coverage, but at the time of the fact-check had not yet reached it. As of 2013, coverage had reached about 87% of the population.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021However, by 2018, Mexico had implemented a public health care system known as Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social , which provides universal health care to Mexican families and foreign residents enrolled in the system.The other country on the OECD’s lack of universal health care list: The United States.(A footnote: Sanders framed his claim around major countries with a guaranteed right to health care, speaking as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don’t. As such, Sanders’ claim was rated Half True.)In that respect, Pocan’s claim is more straightforward -- he spoke of universal coverage.Emails to Pocan’s office seeking more information on his claim went unanswered. That said, Pocan spoke of industrialized nations, so the OECD is a good starting point.Other sourcesAn April 26, 2018 article in The Economist noted:""Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, America remains an outlier in health care provision. It has some of the best hospitals in the world, but it is also the only large rich country without universal health coverage. And health care costs can be financially ruinous.""In a May 14, 2017 opinion piece in The Conversation, Timothy Callaghan, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University Health Science Center, cited multiple reasons for why the U.S. is unlikely to adopt such as system:""Its culture is unusually individualistic, favoring personal over government responsibility; lobbyists are particularly active, spending billions to ensure that private insurers maintain their status in the health system; and our institutions are designed in a manner that limits major social policy changes from happening.""Global Research, an independent research and media organization based in Montreal, Canada,  in a July 9, 2017, paper titled ""America the Only Developed Country Without Universal Healthcare"" said nations providing universal coverage offer one of three forms:1. Government provided single-payer;2. Two-tier providing basic care, along with secondary coverage offering more services based on the ability to pay; and3. Mandate insurance from an employer or individually purchased, supplementing national coverage.Its report classified countries in this manner, and noted that when you move beyond the OECD -- to less industrialized nations -- there are dozens with universal health care. Among them: Belarus, North Korea, Mongolia, Romania, Tajikistan and Uruguay.Our rulingPocan said ""the United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal health care.""Our research, including an earlier fact-check done by PolitiFact National, made clear this is the case. Indeed, there are numerous non-industrialized countries that also offer universal health care.We rate the claim True.","https://twitter.com/repmarkpocan/status/1123225494009339909,https://twitter.com/hashtag/MedicareforAll?src=hash,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/10/bernie-sanders-unveils-medicare-for-all-bill-amid-2020-democratic-primary.html,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/apr/11/medicare-all-defines-democratic-health-care-debate/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/feb/19/explaining-medicare-all/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/,http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/society-at-a-glance-2014/coverage-for-health-care_soc_glance-2014-26-en,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/,https://www.mexperience.com/how-to-access-the-mexican-healthcare-system-imss/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/,https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/04/26/america-is-a-health-care-outlier-in-the-developed-world,https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-does-not-have-universal-health-care-while-many-other-countries-do-77591,https://www.globalresearch.ca/america-the-only-developed-country-without-universal-healthcare/5598311",,"Health Care,Medicaid,Medicare,Wisconsin,Mark Pocan",,,,,

For Garland Tucker III, it is part of the reason why he is challenging incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis.When Tucker appeared on The Sean Hannity Show May 8 to announce his campaign for Tillis’ seat in 2020, he said he was most concerned with Tillis’ ""weak"" immigration policies.""He co-sponsored a bill that not only provided amnesty, but provided a clear path to citizenship for illegal immigrants,"" Tucker said on the radio show.PolitiFact reached out to Tucker’s campaign to ask what he meant. Carter Wrenn, spokesman for Tucker, said Tucker was referring to the 2017 ""Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers, Employment, and Defending our Nation,"" or Succeed Act.As it turns out, the Succeed Act would only pertain to people who were brought to the country illegally as minors. They are sometimes known as DREAMers, a term derived from the Dream Act, a legislative bill that was first introduced in Congress in 2001 but never passed. It’s an increasingly vocal group of young people who argue that after being raised and educated in the U.S., they have nowhere else to call home.Tillis sponsored the legislation as a more GOP-friendly immigration solution for that group of immigrants, as compared to the bipartisan Dream Act or President Obama’s DACA policy. Tillis’ bill did not pass the Senate.The Tillis campaign said the Succeed Act was introduced as part of a larger plan to reach a compromise on border security. When the bill was introduced, Tillis and another sponsor, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma stressed that the bill should not be passed if it was not paired with a solution for the border.""Sen. Tillis does not support amnesty. What Sen. Tillis has strongly supported is President Trump’s plan to secure our borders, modernize our immigration system, and stop illegal immigration,"" Tillis’ campaign manager, Luke Blanchat, said.The word ""amnesty"" has been the subject of many a fact-check by PolitiFact — including checks about Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida candidate Adam Putnam’s stances on immigration — but we wanted to see if there was any truth to Tucker’s claim. WHAT IS THE SUCCEED ACT?The Succeed Act is comprised of five steps to citizenship that would occur over at least a 15-year timeline.The first step of the bill is to meet all eligibility requirements for conditional status. In order to even qualify for this, an immigrant must have entered the United States illegally before age 16 and lived there continuously since June 15, 2012, when DACA was announced. They also would have to have been younger than 31 on June 15, 2012.DACA refers to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that gave young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children the opportunity to work, study and get a driver’s license without fear of deportation.Under the Succeed Act, immigrants are required to obtain a high school diploma or equivalent, pass a criminal background check, submit biometric and biographic data to the Department of Homeland Security, pay off any existing tax liabilities, be of ""good moral character"" and sign a waiver from future immigration benefits if they violate the terms of their status.If a minor had applied for and received conditional permanent resident status, they would have to reapply when they turned 18 and would be required to either maintain gainful employment for 48 out of 60 months, earn a post-secondary or vocational degree, or serve honorably in the U.S. military for at least three years.Featured Fact-checkJenna Wadsworthstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.""By Paul Specht • February 1, 2021After five years, they would then have to apply yet again, and if they had maintained conditional permanent residence for 10 years, they would finally have the opportunity to apply to be lawful permanent residents. After five years of lawful permanent residence, they could apply for naturalization and become U.S. citizens.Despite the many restrictions specified in the Succeed Act, Carter Wrenn, a spokesman for Tucker, said that it still qualifies as amnesty because ""amnesty is a pathway to citizenship.""The real question is: what is amnesty? And does the Succeed Act fit the bill?WHAT IS AMNESTY?Amnesty means a pardon for a large group of people, and in the context of immigration, it has become a politically charged word. Amnesty does not have a ""black and white definition,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Migration Policy Institute. Some people say that any path to legal status for migrants is amnesty, and others say there is more to it. However, she said, compared to many other immigration reform proposals, the Succeed Act was one of the narrower options.Steven Camarota, the director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for less immigration, said that immigration amnesty is just like any other amnesty. In the simplest terms, he said, amnesty is forgiveness for a crime. Most amnesties have requirements that ultimately result in forgiveness, so having stringent requirements does not disqualify the Succeed Act from being considered an amnesty.""Every parking ticket amnesty, every tax amnesty and every other amnesty always had requirements,"" he said. ""The 1986 IRCA amnesty did.""IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan, usually serves as the standard for amnesty in immigration policy. In addition to a few minimal requirements, the bill said illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents, or green card holders, as long as they could prove they were in the U.S. by Jan. 1, 1982. This means that any immigrant who had been in the country continuously for about four years when the bill was signed into law in 1986, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated ""good moral character"" would be granted legal status.In comparison, the Succeed Act would not qualify an immigrant for permanent resident status unless they qualified as a minor who entered the country before they were 16, lived there continuously since and were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012. They must have also already applied for, obtained and sustained conditional legal status for 10 years.""I consider (Tucker’s claim) a deeply misleading use of the word amnesty,"" said Edward Alden, the Bernard L. Schwartz senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank.Alden said that the Succeed Act was written for children who were brought here by their parents while they were still minors. Since amnesty is the act of forgiveness of a crime, and these children were legally unable to commit a crime, they could not be found legally responsible for their actions or even need amnesty, Alden said.Compared to other immigration proposals, such as the Reagan-era IRCA, the Succeed Act is far more restrictive, and it only covers a group of people who fall under a gray area in the law.OUR RULINGTucker argued that Tillis’ Succeed Act was pro-amnesty because it gave illegal immigrants a clear path to citizenship.He is correct that the bill would help pave the way for citizenship for a select number of immigrants in the country illegally, but it only concerns those who were minors when they first entered the country. It would give them the opportunity to apply for citizenship only after a long and highly restrictive 15-year process. Additionally, Tillis said the bill should not pass unless it was combined with a border security plan.Tucker did not specify that the Succeed Act only pertained to that group, so his claim gave the false impression that the proposed bill would grant a general amnesty for illegal immigration.Therefore, we rate it Mostly False.This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

We’ll need two new prisons soon, at the cost of $485 million over the next five years.""",,politifact,,"The U.S. prison population remains a challenge, especially in Missouri, which had the eighth-highest prison population in 2017.Missouri’s prison population has been widely discussed in the state legislature with the House passing House Bill 113 on Feb. 21. Known as the Justice Safety Valve Act, the bill allows flexibility in mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders. This reduces mandatory minimums for first-time offenders, but more importantly, it lightens the sentences for people who have already been to prison.The largest contributor to the prison population is inmate recidivism, or the re-incarceration of released inmates due to parole violation or other offenses. According to state prison data, from 2008-2012, an average of 48.1 percent of inmates returned to prison within five years of release.At a Feb. 19 hearing for legislators to discuss and amend the bill, sponsor Rep. Cody Smith, R- Jasper, said, ""On our current trajectory, we’ll be 2,000 prison beds short by 2021...We’ll need two new prisons soon, at the cost of $485 million over the next five years.""This statistic seemed surprising since Gov. Mike Parson recently announced a plan to merge two correctional centers because of a decline in inmate population.How could Missouri’s prisons be overcrowded enough to require two new facilities, but also able to consolidate buildings because of low inmate populations? We decided to find out.Council of State GovernmentsAfter reaching out to Smith’s office, we were sent to the Council of State Governments’ Justice Center. The state of Missouri partnered with the Justice Center to evaluate the prison system in 2017 the Justice Reinvestment Task Force. Smith’s numbers came from the council’s reports on Missouri’s system. The task force reported in a September 2017 presentation, ""If current trends continue, MDOC will be 2,351 prison beds short of needed capacity by the end of FY2021."" This data came from the Department of Corrections’ 2016 Offender Profile combined with its August 2017 Population Forecast.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Smith also got the ""two new prisons"" part of his claim from the presentation. The homepage of the Missouri section of the Justice Center’s website says, ""the state will need to build two new prison facilities by FY2021, which will cost nearly half a billion dollars in combined construction and operating costs.""The slides from September 2017 say, ""The cost of constructing a new 1,636-bed facility (e.g., Chillicothe women’s facility) is about $175 million."" Two prisons would then cost around $350 million in construction costs alone. With operating costs, the cost climbs to about $404 million. The first three years’ operation of the facilities would bring the cost to $485 million.Two years later, is it relevant?Sheridan Watson of the CSG’s Justice Center said that Missouri’s prison population has declined since 2017. This is due in part to June 2018’s HB 1355, which aims to help law enforcement reduce violent crime while creating better support systems of support for people with mental illness or substance abuse issues within the criminal justice system. These systems of support include counseling, drug rehabilitation, and more to help break cycles of addiction. Bills like Smith’s HB 113 also help by lowering the amount of time nonviolent inmates spend behind bars.""However, the patterns and trends driving prison admissions and prison capacity in Missouri remain and are being addressed by the Justice Reinvestment process,"" Watson said in an email. There isn’t data yet to compare Missouri to other states in 2019, so it’s unknown where Missouri ranks. However, Karen Pojmann, communications director for the Missouri Department of Corrections, pointed out that the population ""declined from over 32,000 in 2017 to 29,500 this year,"" an eight-percent decrease.""We’re not banking on numbers staying down, but we have introduced programs to reduce recidivism,"" Pojmann said. ""The population has dropped enough to consolidate two prisons...we have all the prison beds we need.""Our rulingSmith said, ""On our current trajectory, we’ll be 2,000 prison beds short by 2021...We’ll need two new prisons soon, at the cost of $485 million over the next five years.""Smith based his statement on data from 2017. Initiatives to reduce the prison population in the state have lowered the population in the last two years. Smith’s claim needs more context. More importantly, it ignores previous changes in the law that reduced the overpopulation issue. While more progress can certainly be made to eliminate recidivism, Missouri’s situation is no longer so dire as Smith’s claim would make it appear.

Elizabeth Warren warned about the financial crisis of the 2000s before it happened, she claimed during a CNN town hall where she pitched herself as the best option for president in the 2020 election.Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told an audience of college students that her whole life’s work has been ""about what's happening to working families.""""And starting in the early 2000s, the crisis was coming. I was waving my arms, ringing the bell, doing everything I could. I said families are getting cheated all over this country,"" Warren said April 22 in Manchester, N.H. ""It started when the mortgage companies targeted communities of color. They targeted seniors. They targeted Latinos. They came in and sold the worst possible mortgages and stripped wealth out of those communities, and then took those products across the nation. I went everywhere I could. I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming.""But nobody wanted to listen, Warren said, ""so the crisis hit in 2007, 2008, and just took us down.""We confirmed that Warren did raise the alarm about the looming housing and financial crisis. She spoke about debt, financial lending practices and other factors affecting families and the economy years before the financial crisis peaked in 2008.Sounding the alarm when Warren was a Harvard professorMillions of people lost their jobs and homes during the recent Great Recession, generally regarded as happening from late 2007 to mid 2009. Experts say the financial crisis resulted from a number of colliding factors, including an unsustainable housing boom partly driven by an easy availability of mortgages, banks taking on too much risk, government policies and lax regulation.Subprime loans — loans at higher interest rates made to people perceived to be at greater risk for defaulting on loans (including families with low and moderate income and poor credit histories) — played a key role in the housing crisis.Warren’s presidential campaign cited several blog posts and comments to media outlets in 2005 and 2006, and Warren’s 2003 book, ""The Two-Income Trap,"" co-authored with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, as examples of Warren warning about subprime lending and an imminent housing crisis. Warren has represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate since 2013. Before going to Congress, she taught law at the university level for more than 30 years, most recently at Harvard, specializing in commercial law, contracts, and bankruptcy.Subprime lenders defended their business practices by saying they were helping more families own homes, Warren’s book said, but that’s ""little more than public relations hot air.""""In the overwhelming majority of cases, subprime lenders prey on families that already own their own homes, rather than expanding access to new homeowners. Fully 80 percent of subprime mortgages involve refinancing loans for families that already own their homes,"" Warren said in the book. ""For these families, subprime lending does nothing more than increase the family's housing costs, taking resources away from other investments and increasing the chances that the family will lose its home if anything goes wrong.""In a June 2004 interview with PBS’s NOW host David Brancaccio, Warren spoke about growing household debt, against risky mortgage lending practices and what she regarded as bad advice to Americans by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Warren said Greenspan encouraged families to borrow against their house to pay for basic expenses.""I think what the landscape shows is the middle class is under assault in a way that has not happened before in our history,"" Warren said. ""Stagnant wages, rising costs, wildly rising debt. It's in everyone's interest to turn that back around.""Warren’s campaign noted that The New York Times quoted Warren in an October 2005 article that said homeowners in suburbs were taking on more and more home-equity debt to stay out of bankruptcy.The article said: ""Professor Warren of Harvard believes that disaster lurks as homeowners borrow against their homes to forestall bankruptcy. When the stock market tumbled five years ago, people in trouble could sell stocks to stay afloat, she said. But home equity doesn't work the same way. As she put it, ‘You can't sell a part of your home like you could a stock in the stock market bubble.’""Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021Warren told the newspaper that after a new bankruptcy law went into effect that month, filing for bankruptcy would become more difficult: ""And that means more families are set up to lose their homes.""Warren was ""substantially correct"" in her assessment that home prices were going up rapidly relative to incomes (particularly for households with a one wage earner), said Ed Pinto, co-director of the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.But Pinto disagrees with Warren about what caused the crisis. Warren ""blames banks and lenders, when in fact Congress and government policies aimed at making homes ‘more affordable’ are the root cause,"" Pinto said.(Check out our 2008 in-depth analysis on the causes of the financial crisis and how that issue was debated in the 2008 presidential campaign. Then, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama said they sounded warnings, and both blamed the other for helping cause the crisis.)Consumer advocate groups credit Warren for alerting about the crisisWarren was also a vocal opponent of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, because she thought the law would hurt consumers, said Deborah Goldstein, an executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, which advocates for consumer financial protections.Rising credit card debt hurt Americans already struggling with mortgage payments.""I remember (Warren) talking about credit card abuses and how they were harming families,"" Goldstein said. ""People were using credit to manage basic daily expenses.""Goldstein said that her group, also concerned about the imminent financial crisis, in the early 2000s communicated with Warren on what could be done about it.""I'd give then-professor Warren the credit for banging the drum and ringing the bell early on unfair financial practices,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the Federal Consumer Program at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Warren was the ""No. 1 go-to academic expert"" in the mid-to-late '90s and 2000s in the debate over changes to the bankruptcy code, he said.Warren in January 2007 testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, saying that the credit card market was broken and hurt consumers.Warren was chosen in 2008 to lead the Congressional Oversight Panel, established by Congress to review the state of the financial markets and the regulatory system.Warren also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau emerged from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, designed to enforce federal consumer financial laws and protect consumers.

This is swamp politics at its worst.— Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) April 8, 2019There’s an element of truth to her claim: A government proposal would change the process for inspecting swine, and some consumer advocacy groups argue it will give greater control to the pork industry.But Gabbard stretches the facts by saying companies will be the ones doing the inspections. It’s more nuanced than that. The proposal does allow plants to stop testing carcasses for E. coli (the tests are done to monitor sanitation and process control). However, there would be a new testing requirement for the same purpose.Gabbard’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s requests for comment.Background on current swine inspection process, proposed changesThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is tasked with inspecting meat, poultry and processed egg products so they are safe to eat.The agency in February 2018 proposed changing the animal inspection process at plants that slaughter pigs raised for meat. The proposal would require plant employees to sort animals showing signs of disease or other conditions from the animals that appear to be healthy.Currently, plants do this sorting voluntarily and at the direction of agency inspectors. The inspectors are there to guide the process.But sorting is different from inspecting, and federal inspections would still happen, the agency said.The sorting of acceptable and unacceptable hogs happens before a USDA veterinarian ultimately inspects the animal. Under the proposal, government veterinarians would still be the ones inspecting animals before they are slaughtered.The proposal would also require hog plant employees to trim and identify defects on carcasses and parts before an agency inspector does a post-mortem examination. Under current regulations, plant workers are not required to do post-mortem sorting — it only happens after an agency inspector directs them to do so and after the inspector does an initial sorting, the proposed rule said.Plant employees who sort animals would be the first set of eyes checking a carcass, and government inspectors would be the second set of eyes doing a thorough inspection, said Sarah Schieck, who as an educator at the University of Minnesota Swine Extension provides research-based education and resources to pig farmers.There are around 600 plants in the United States that slaughter swine. But the government expects that only 35 (beyond five in a pilot program) are likely to adopt the proposed voluntary New Swine Slaughter Inspection System, because they share characteristics of the plants in the pilot. Plants that don’t switch can continue operating under the traditional inspection model.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021The food safety agency said it is reviewing public comments and in the process of writing the final rule.What about E. coli testing?The government proposed removing a requirement that hog plants test carcasses for generic E. coli. Plants do that testing to monitor their sanitation and process control.Instead of mandating generic E. coli testing, the agency wants to allow plants ""to develop sampling plans that are more tailored"" to their specific location and that better monitor their process control. It recommended testing for aerobic plate count, which is ""less specific than generic E. coli,"" the agency’s draft guideline said. (Plants could also choose to continue testing for generic E. coli.)A shift to aerobic plate count testing wouldn’t pose a greater health risk for consumers, food safety experts told PolitiFact.""It is reasonable to test for the largest group of microbes one can, because that will be the most sensitive to pick up a breakdown in sanitation processes,"" said Matthew Stasiewicz, an assistant professor of applied food safety at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Is it all Trump’s doing?The Trump administration is moving forward on the proposal, but this isn’t a rushed change it initiated.Plans and data gathering began in the 1990s under the Clinton administration, and there was a 20-year pilot program in five hog establishments, the agency said.Similar changes were approved and implemented for poultry inspections during the Obama years, experts said.Still, consumer advocates aren’t applauding the proposed changes for the pork industry.It matters if plant workers are the ones sorting animals, because ""workers can’t safely speak up to protect consumers,"" said Amanda L. Hitt, director of public health and director of the Food Integrity Campaign at the Government Accountability Project. ""Unlike inspectors, workers cannot safely blow the whistle on public health violations.""Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the Center for Food Safety, also pointed to a 2013 audit from the USDA’s office of inspector general that found the agency ""did not adequately oversee"" the swine pilot program and could not determine whether the program goals of increasing food safety and plant efficiency were met.A separate 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office also said that the pilot program ""would not provide reasonable assurance that any conclusions can apply more broadly"" to the estimated 600 hog plants in the country, because of the small sample size.Our rulingGabbard tweeted, ""Trump’s effort to rollback regulations means that Big Ag now gets to inspect its own pork - & they decided to stop testing for E. coli.""The Trump administration is advancing a proposal that has been in development for decades. Some consumer advocacy groups are concerned that the changes will create safety risks.The proposal allows hog plants to opt-in to a new inspection system, under which plant workers (and not federal regulators) would sort animals for inspection. However, sorting is not the same as inspecting. The food safety agency would still be the one inspecting hogs.The proposal eliminates a requirement that plants test carcasses for generic E. coli, testing that’s done to track sanitation and process control. But the government would still require monitoring of process control and recommends other testing that experts said would be a greater food safety measure. (Establishments could also choose to continue testing for E. coli.)Overall, Gabbard’s tweet is misleading and doesn’t tell the whole picture. We rate it Mostly False.

Scott Walker) made a point of meeting with legislative leaders on a regular basis. We extended a similar offer to (Evers), but it seems he's only interested in talking every few months.""Clearly, Evers and GOP legislative leaders are figuring out the new ""normal"" of a divided state government after eight years of Republican control.With Walker in office, Republican leaders had a standing Wednesday meeting with the governor, which hasn’t happened under Evers.But communication in Madison isn’t limited to elected officials. A lot of work gets done in meetings between staffers, or legislators meeting with gubernatorial appointees. That was common under Walker as well.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021At a March 5, 2019 news conference Evers had this to say about meetings with lawmakers:""We’ll meet with (Republican leaders) as often as we need to. I’m not sure we need to schedule Tuesday morning at 10 o’clock every week, but the bottom line is we need to have good conversations and we need to involve staff members in those conversations, so we truly have a good dialogue going.""In a March 31, 2019 tweet that came after the Steineke interview aired, Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that the previous week Evers said he hadn’t been talking to legislative leaders directly, but his top aides were in contact with them.The evidenceAlesha Emmert, communications director for Steineke, said the lawmaker’s claim on UpFront was referring to substantive meetings with Republican leaders.""Our office is aware Governor Evers has been introducing himself to legislators since he took office – we tweeted a photo from our own meeting,"" Emmert wrote. ""But to be clear, these interactions have been very brief. In Rep. Steineke’s 15-minute meeting, some niceties were exchanged, and the only substantial conversation was a request made by my boss to have more regular, structured meetings.""As evidence, she noted Evers’ opposition to weekly meetings at the March 5 news conference, the Marley tweet and several letters to Evers in which Republican leaders referenced wanting to work together with the governor.Emmert did not provide an example of any specific invitation that Evers declined.Vos communications director Kit Beyer said the speaker has had one sit-down with Evers aside from the initial meet-and-greet. Like Emmert, she noted that Republican leaders have asked for a regular meeting, but Evers has not shown an interest in that.Meanwhile, Evers’ staff says attempts on their end to set up meetings have found little traction.Melissa Baldauff, Evers’ spokeswoman said an aide had reached out to staffers for Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, the week before Steineke’s comment. The aide was seeking a meeting with them and Evers but did not immediately get a response. She shared an April 1, 2019, email the aide sent that reiterates the request for the three leaders to meet.Baldauff also provided emails that referenced Evers’ staffers attempting to set up a meeting between Fitzgerald, Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, and Evers’ chief of staff to talk about gubernatorial appointments.Another email referenced attempts to arrange a meeting between policy directors for Evers and Vos, as an outgrowth of an earlier meeting between Evers and Vos.We’ll note that all this back and forth — also detailed in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story on April 9, 2019 — did eventually lead to a meeting plan.

His staff offered no evidence of a specific meeting being refused.And in fact, the opposite appears true. Evers’ staff reached out to facilitate a meeting between Evers and Republican leaders in the days before Steineke’s TV appearance, and they received no immediate response.That makes Steineke’s claim Half True.","https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-republican-lawmaker-state-is-absolutely-in-a-constitutional-crisis/27007046,https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1112822710365814784,https://twitter.com/hashtag/WI4Us?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/oeaZceskY9,https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1112822710365814784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/jimsteineke/status/1112832943045664768,https://twitter.com/SpeakerVos/status/1112837019754024964,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H6i9gZLFnw&feature=youtu.be&t=450,https://twitter.com/patrickdmarley/status/1112378834383441920,https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/bHnwCQWKP0Ikzw0WAsMzWLT?domain=legis.wisconsin.gov,https://twitter.com/lkwhite/status/1108475077052559366,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5805731-Evers-Aide-Seeks-Meeting.html,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5805781-Evers-Fitzgerald-Shilling-Meeting.html,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5805782-Policy-Director-Email.html,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/04/09/wisconsin-politics-governor-and-lawmakers-barely-talking/3363770002/",,"State Budget,Wisconsin,Jim Steineke",,,,,

But the campaign has previously cited a Politico news article on reports released in November 2018 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those reports were on life expectancy as of 2017.We’ll take Yang’s statement in three parts:1. Yang was a bit off in saying life expectancy has declined for three straight years, in that there was no change from 2015 to 2016, according to CDC figures that were revised slightly after their initial release:2014: 78.9 years2015: 78.7 years2016: 78.7 years2017: 78.6 yearsFeatured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 20212. That was the first time such a three-year stretch had occurred since the flu pandemic a century ago, the CDC said. So, he’s right about it being ""100 years"" since something similar happened.3. A CDC report cited three causes of death that have contributed to the decline in life expectancy: drug overdoses and suicides, as Yang said, but also chronic liver disease. (The CDC said chronic liver disease may be caused by both biological and behavioral factors, including hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection and excessive alcohol consumption.)According to the CDC, in 2017 there were a record number of fatal drug overdoses (70,237) and a continued growth in suicides (47,173), with the rate of suicides growing by one-third since 1999.So, overdoses and suicides were major causes of the decline in life expectancy.Shannon Monnat, a sociology professor and co-director of the Policy, Place, and Population Health Lab at Syracuse University, went so far as to say the recent decline ""is due almost entirely"" to increases in overdoses and suicides. She told us: ""Although the declines are small, they are unprecedented, and they are signals that there is a serious well-being crisis in the U.S.""University of Maryland professor Andrew Fenelon, a sociologist and demographer whose research specialties include health disparities and population health, told us that Yang goes too far in citing only overdoses and suicides as the reasons for the decline.""Identifying a ‘cause’ of a very small decline in life expectancy is hard, because many causes of death for which there were increases in mortality could, in essence, be said to be the reason for the decline,"" Fenelon said.Still, it’s clear, as news media reports on the CDC figures reflected at the time, that overdoses and suicides were major drivers of the decline.As for the significance of the decline, Fenelon agreed with Monnat, calling the three-year decline ""extraordinary.""""We are simply not used to seeing, on a national scale, declines in life expectancy, especially not ones lasting more than one year. It is a major crisis,"" he said. ""And not only are we failing to improve life expectancy in an absolute sense, as we have done for the past hundred years, but we're also falling farther behind the rest of the high-income world.""Our rulingYang stated: ""America’s life expectancy has declined for the last three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, because of surges in suicides and drug overdoses.""Yang’s claim is based on the most recent figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the three years since 2014 for which data are available, life expectancy dropped in 2015, stayed the same in 2016 and dropped in 2017.

It also quotes Jefferson as saying that ""Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.""The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)We previously checked out the rumor that the Declaration of Independence was supposedly written on hemp paper and rated it False.For a quick re-hashing, officials at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, say that the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin.""A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true,"" Monticello says on its website.But did Jefferson actually grow and smoke marijuana and did he say hemp is the ""first necessity to the wealth and protection of this country?""Well, there is one kernel of confirmable truth: Jefferson did grow hemp—but not necessarily ""weed,"" as the post suggests.While hemp comes from cannabis plants like marijuana, it doesn’t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol—or THC, for short—the active chemical in marijuana that causes people to experience the ""high"" often associated with the drug.State statutes, with the exception of West Virginia, define industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a THC concentration of no more than 0.3 percent. (West Virginia puts it at less than 1 percent.)The level of THC in marijuana is not always the same and can vary depending on the strain or variety of the plant, the way it is grown, the part of the plant that is used and the way it is stored. Hash, for example, can have THC concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent, while marijuana cannabis (the dried buds and leaves of the plant) can vary widely in potency from 1 to 20 percent. It is also worth noting that the marijuana used today is stronger than it used to be.Jefferson grew hemp both at Monticello and his other plantation, Poplar Forest, but it was primarily used (along with flax and cotton) to make clothing. Other founding fathers, including George Washington, grew hemp and Americans were legally bound to grow the plant during the Colonial Era and Early Republic.But there is no record of Jefferson ever smoking the plant.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post “Trump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 4, 2021The National Constitution Center, an institution devoted to the U.S. Constitution, tackled some of the most popular myths about the Founding Fathers and marijuana and noted that if Jefferson or others at the time did attempt smoking hemp, they likely didn’t experience euphoria because of its low levels of THC.Monticello addressed the rumor as well, and said there is no evidence to suggest that Jefferson was a habitual smoker of ""hemp, tobacco, or any other substance.""""Some have pointed to a supposed reference in Jefferson's farm book to separating male and female hemp plants as evidence that he was cultivating it for purposes of recreational smoking,"" the organization wrote, ""... no such reference exists in Jefferson's farm book or any other document.""The quote that hemp is ""of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country"" can be found in the national archived Jefferson papers, which is a collection of the correspondence and papers not only written by Jefferson, as well as letters he received.This particular phrase wasn’t written or said by Jefferson, said David Sewell, manager of Digital Initiatives of The University of Virginia Press, which works in conjunction with Founders Online.What’s more, the quote is a little incomplete.The phrase was written in ""Enclosure: Notes respecting Tobacco"" on March 16, 1791, by Gouverneur Morris, a founding father, American statesman, and a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.The full quote: ""A Fact well established in the System of Agriculture is that the best Hemp and the best Tobacco grow on the same Kind of Soil. The former Article is of first Necessity to the Commerce and Marine in other Words to the Wealth and Protection of the Country.""So while the comment was included in a letter sent to Jefferson, it wasn’t his words.""If the words have been attributed to Jefferson,"" Sewell wrote in an email to PolitiFact, ""that is probably the result of someone’s misunderstanding of the context, or of wanting to associate them with someone with better name recognition.""It’s worth noting that while Jefferson may not have said this particular quote, he did consider hemp to be an important crop, and made several references to it in his letters.Our ruling A meme being shared online claims that Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper, grew and smoked marijuana, and once said the plant was of ""first necessity to the protection and wealth of the country.""The Declaration of Independence was not drafted on hemp, but on parchment made from animal skin, But Jefferson did indeed grow the plant (not necessarily weed, though).There is no evidence to suggest Jefferson ever smoked marijuana, and if he had, it likely would have been the hemp he grew, which had very low levels of THC. Jefferson also did not say that specific phrase, but his favor of the crop is well documented.With all this taken into account, we rate this post Mostly False.Update March 15, 2019: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that a quote similar to the one attributed to Jefferson in this claim is found in the Jefferson papers but was not made by Jefferson himself.

So a budget can call for more dollars year after year, but if that’s less than what population growth and inflation and other factors would predict, both the White House and lawmakers refer to that as either savings or cuts (depending on which side of the debate they are on).Trillion dollar cut to Medicaid?The Sanders team told us the overall statement has to do with Trump’s FY 2019 budget plan. A White House budget is never more than a picture of a world the administration would like to see, because the final spending policy decisions are made by Congress. That’s especially true for this budget’s Medicaid provisions.Offered in February 2018, the proposal relied on replacing Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid with a block grant to the states, mirroring a plan that a few months earlier had stalled in the Senate.The White House plan included caps on the growth of Medicaid and the creation of a new grant program. Sorting out the net impacts on spending is tricky. Year to year, spending rises. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicaid spending would fall by $1.3 trillion over the 10 years between 2019 and 2028, based on current law.On the other hand, the CBO said the new state grant program would get nearly $970 billion over the same period. A portion of that would go toward people helped by Medicaid today.""The net effect of those changes is $954 billion in cuts,"" said senior policy director Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group with hawkish views on deficits. ""There are also modest cuts elsewhere in the program that could bring the number closer to $1 trillion.""‘$500 billion’ from MedicareAt first blush, America’s health insurance program for seniors and the disabled would get $472 billion less under Trump’s budget, according to the CBO. But some of those dollars come back through different doors.The biggest example involves paying hospitals and other providers for care they provide but never get paid for. The White House budget reduces payments by at least $100 billion, but that’s partly offset by a newly created uncompensated care pool worth $63 billion.There’s a similar dynamic with the budget line for graduate medical education. Those dollars flow to ""teaching hospitals,"" essentially places where new doctors continue their training. The White House trims the original budget line by $146 billion, but then proposes $139 billion for a fund that would cover this for both Medicare and Medicaid, which has a similar physician training provision. There’s still a cut between the two of $28 billion. The numbers don’t show exactly how much would fall on Medicare, but the net result is much smaller than first appears.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021Overall, ""the true cut is less than the $472 billion,"" said John Holahan, a fellow in the Health Policy Institute at the Urban Institute in Washington.Goldwein estimated the total cut at closer to $300 billion. And again, we note that actual dollars spent rise each year.It is worth noting that President Barack Obama also proposed Medicare cuts totalling $419 billion over 10 years. Trimming payments to providers was central to the Obama administration’s long-term strategy to keep Medicare financially balanced. The two single largest reductions proposed by Trump curtailed the dollars going to hospitals, which isn't the same as taking benefits away from Medicare recipients.White House inflates disability effectsThe White House budget message itself provides the $72 billion reduction in disability payments that Sanders cited. But two-thirds of that might never come to pass.The White House counts $48 billion in savings from testing ""new approaches to increase labor force participation."" That refers to programs to keep people working, because if they work, those people won’t need disability payments. If those pilot efforts cut benefits regardless of whether people find work, then the cuts would be real.But Goldwein at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget is skeptical.""These savings mostly won’t materialize,"" he said.The CBO doesn’t include the $48 billion savings in its analysis. Its tally shows about $15 billion in cuts for the disabled.The White House total also includes savings in the Social Security Supplemental Security Income fund, which is a separate program.Our rulingSanders said Trump proposed cuts of $1 trillion to Medicaid, $500 billion to Medicare and $72 billion to the Social Security Disability Fund.Numbers from the CBO and experts we reached confirmed the $1 trillion in Medicaid reductions.The Medicare reductions are less than Sanders said, probably in the range of $300 to $400 billion.While the White House might claim $72 billion in savings from the Social Security Disability Fund, the CBO put the number at about $15 billion.There’s no question Trump’s budget called for major reductions in Medicaid and Medicare spending from what would have been without changes in law or policy. Part of that plan reduced money going to hospitals and other providers, which is not the same as reducing benefits to recipients.We rate this claim Half True.

It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail.""What the FAQ saidWe reached out to Scott’s press office and did not hear back by deadline, but the senator was probably referring to some supporting documents released by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff.A frequently asked questions, or FAQ, document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.""The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.""(For the record, according to the UC Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ""cows do contribute to global warming, although in fact they mostly do so by burping rather than farting."")Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021As soon as the the FAQ document became public, the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete was picked up by Fox News and some Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump.Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake.Climate change experts say ending air travel not a goalExperts on climate change say it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight.""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school.Hecht noted that the FAQ doesn’t include any regulatory strategy to ban or even reduce air travel.""It’s framed even in the FAQ as creating conditions where ‘air travel stops becoming necessary’ because alternatives are available -- not limiting or ending air travel,"" he said.David Weiskopf, climate policy director for NextGen Climate America, said the Green New Deal calls for a ""net-zero"" goal, which recognizes that emissions -- including from air travel -- won’t be eliminated in 10 years, so there would need to find negative emissions to balance them out. (NextGen Climate America was started by billionaire Tom Steyer. In 2018, the PAC supported Scott’s Democratic opponent, Bill Nelson.)""The comment about cows and planes is not at all an expression of a policy goal to actually eliminate either. It is delivering information that some supporters may not want to hear -- that we will not zero out emissions completely, so we need some additional negative emissions -- expressed in what I take to be a colloquial tone that unfortunately left it open to misconstrual by critics,"" he said. ""No serious observer, supporter of the Green New Deal, climate scientist, or other climate advocate would take these statements as expressing a policy aim to eliminate cows or planes.""Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances.""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy.""Serious steps that the United States could take to reduce emissions from air travel emissions would include more efficient planes, more direct routes and alternative bio-based low-carbon fuels.In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University.""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel -- that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House.Our rulingTime to bring this fact-check in for a landing.Scott wrote in an op-ed that the Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel.""The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Scott seized on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates.We rate this statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9bfff8cf-473e-4439-bf37-6ee568e32fda","https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-op-rick-scott-green-new-deal-20190225-story.html,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22green+new+deal%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22green+new+deal%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=2,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22green+new+deal%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1,https://web.archive.org/web/20190207191119/https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/media/blog-posts/green-new-deal-faq,https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5729035/Green-New-Deal-FAQ.pdf#page=5,http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2569,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-ocasio-cortez-aims-to-make-air-travel-obsolete-aid-those-unwilling-to-work,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/14/liz-cheneys-claim-that-green-new-deal-would-eliminate-air-travel/?utm_term=.3d7b3f814416,https://twitter.com/Team_Mitch/status/1095429215808311296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1095429215808311296&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.courier-journal.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F02%2F13%2Fmcconnell-allow-vote-democrats-green-new-deal%2F2851792002%2F,https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/2/barrasso-on-green-new-deal-we-need-solutions-not-socialism,https://www.c-span.org/video/?457668-1/president-trump-holds-rally-el-paso-texas,https://twitter.com/saikatc/status/1094263693368610816,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9bfff8cf-473e-4439-bf37-6ee568e32fda",,"Environment,Climate Change,Congress,Transportation,Florida,Rick Scott",,,,,

Awesome news!""Thanks to successful federal, state, and local efforts, preliminary statistics show opioid overdose deaths are down 8.5% in West Virginia. Awesome news! https://t.co/uICcVlU7vZ— Shelley Moore Capito (@SenCapito) January 22, 2019Is this statistic correct? Capito’s office did not respond to several inquiries, but we were able to find data that addresses the question.Her tweet links to a USA Today article about newly released data on opioids published the same day as the tweet. Accompanying that article is a link to a related article that summarizes the state-by-state data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.According to the breakdown, West Virginia’s predicted 12-month number for overdose deaths from all drugs fell from 1,047 in 2017 to 958 in 2018. That’s a decrease of 8.5 percent, as Capito said.However, we should note a couple caveats.First, a different cut of the CDC data actually shows even stronger declines in West Virginia. Preliminary, 12-month statewide data for overdose deaths shows an 18.7 percent decline for reported deaths between July 2017 and July 2018, and a 32 percent decline for predicted deaths over the same period.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Second, the 8.5 percent decline refers to overdose deaths from all drugs, not ""opioid overdose deaths,"" as Capito said.The report doesn’t break down the data for opioid deaths by state. However, other data shows patterns for different drugs, and those serve to complicate Capito’s optimism.A CDC report detailing annual figures for 2016 and 2017 found that in West Virginia, there was a decrease in prescription opioid overdose deaths by almost 13 percent between those two years. However, during the same time period, the deaths from all opioids, including heroin and methadone, rose more than 14 percent, and the death rates from synthetic opioids other than methadone increased by more than 42 percent.In other words, a reduction in the deaths from prescription opioids masked how fast deaths from all opioids and synthetic opioids rose over that period.""The opioid overdose epidemic continues to worsen and evolve because of the continuing increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids,"" the CDC reported, according to a Dec. 28, 2018 article in the Register Herald of Beckley, W.Va.Our rulingCapito tweeted, ""Thanks to successful federal, state, and local efforts, preliminary statistics show opioid overdose deaths are down 8.5% in West Virginia.""This number appears in a USA Today article that summarized CDC data, and other CDC data shows even sharper declines. That’s the good news.However, Capito misidentified the figure as opioid overdose deaths specifically, rather than overdose deaths from all drugs. In addition, a more detailed analysis shows that while prescription opioid overdose deaths are down, overdose deaths from synthetic opioids are up. This suggests a more complicated outlook for the state’s overall overdose problem.We rate the statement Half True.

Roy Cooper and others say expanding Medicaid would provide coverage for hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians. And, according to Cooper, tens of thousands are military veterans.""It is embarrassing that 30,000 veterans in North Carolina have no health insurance and if we expand Medicaid 23,000 of them will,"" Cooper said in an interview with The News & Observer that was posted on Twitter.Cooper isn’t the first North Carolina Democrat to make this claim. In September, state Senate candidate JD Wooten made a similar statement in a campaign video.""My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,"" Wooten said in a caption posted with the video.PolitiFact looked at several elements in Wooten’s claim — Did Gunn vote to block a Medicaid expansion bill? Did that vote prevent 500,000 people from acquiring health insurance? Were 23,000 veterans among those affected? — before rating the claim Mostly True.With that in mind, let’s focus on the first part of Cooper claim. Is it true that 30,000 veterans are without health insurance? PolitiFact couldn’t find statistics for 2018, 2017 or 2016. And the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesn’t track the number of uninsured veterans, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact on Thursday.However, we found credible data from 2015 and 2014. Based on those reports, Cooper’s estimate appears to be on point.A PAIR OF STUDIESContacted by PolitiFact, Cooper’s office cited one of the same sources mentioned in the Wooten fact check: a 2016 study on the effects of the Affordable Care Act on veterans.The study was conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit philanthropic organization that focuses on health care; and the Urban Institute, a think tank that researches the effects of economic and social policies.(When contacted by PolitiFact, the NC Department of Health and Human Services also cited this Urban Institute report. The NC DHHS doesn’t track uninsured veterans, said Chris Mackey, the department’s director of communications.)The study says there were 30,000 uninsured veterans in North Carolina as of 2014. It had been 43,000 in 2013.Featured Fact-checkBillboardstated on February 13, 2021 in a billboard“Gov Roy Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an under lying health issue!”By Paul Specht • February 17, 2021Cooper’s office also cited a 2017 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care research.North Carolina was home to 26,680 uninsured veterans in 2015, according to a chart in Kaiser’s report on Medicaid’s Role in Covering Veterans. The chart represents Kaiser’s most recent estimate, according to Craig Palosky, Kaiser’s director of communications.So Cooper’s number seems reasonable. It’s possible the number of uninsured veterans has fluctuated since 2015. But available estimates put his claim on the money, or within 3,320 veterans.WHO IS UNINSURED?Don’t all veterans have insurance through the military or the VA? Not necessarily.Unless veterans were dishonorably discharged, the VA website says most are eligible for some sort of coverage. There are variables that determine the extent of a veterans’ coverage. But most who served at least 24 continuous months after enlisting in September 1980 or entering active duty in October 1981 are eligible for some sort of coverage.However, there are so many other considerations. And in 2016, about 510,000 veterans lacked insurance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.""Eligibility for the VA health care system is based on veteran status, service-connected disability status, income level and other factors. Moreover, not all eligible veterans actually use VA for their health care, and some may not realize they are eligible for VA health care,"" the Census bureau wrote in a report published in 2017.The Census Bureau also found that the number of low-income veterans on Medicaid increased between 2013 and 2016.""Between 2013 and 2016, the percentage of working-age veterans who had Medicaid increased most for those who lived in poverty. The number of working-age veterans with Medicaid also increased during this period,"" the bureau reported.The VA says veterans with questions can call its health benefits helpline at 1-877-222-8387 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.OUR RULINGCooper said 30,000 veterans in North Carolina have no health insurance. PolitiFact doesn’t know how many veterans lack health insurance as of 2019.While we wish Cooper had used the word ""estimate"" in his statement, his claim comes pretty close to estimates by two reputable organizations. One group said there are 30,000 as of 2014, and the other said there were about 26,600 as of 2015. It’s possible those numbers have fluctuated since then. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings,"" he claimed.Given the many arguments for and against Trump’s border wall, we decided to fact-check the second part of the president’s claim, that the San Diego barrier ""almost completely ended illegal crossings.""Was it the barrier that led to this dramatic change? Or did other factors help reduce illegal entries?We set out on a fact check.Our research The president is correct about the dramatic drop in illegal border crossings, which are measured by border patrol apprehensions.Those arrests in the San Diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630,000 in 1986 to 26,000 in 2017, according to the Associated Press. The biggest drop took place in the late 1990s, several years after San Diego’s first border fence was built.But illegal entries across the entire Southern border, and not just in San Diego, have been on the decline for nearly two decades. They’ve dropped from more than 1.5 million in 2000 to less than 500,000 in 2018, according to the The New York Times.Based on these news reports, plus interviews with experts on the border and a 2007 Congressional Research Service report, PolitiFact California found that San Diego’s fencing was not the only reason for the dramatic decrease in illegal crossings.  ""It’s not only the fence,"" said Victor Clark-Alfaro, a Latin American Studies professor at San Diego State University. ""It has to do with (expanded) job opportunities in Mexico, it has to do with rhetoric from Trump.""The federal government ""also increased technology and staffing,"" added Paola Avila, vice president of international business affairs at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. ""You need to see the whole picture.""The White House did not respond when asked about Trump’s statement.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Doubling of border patrol agentsThe Congressional Research Service is Congress’ nonpartisan public policy research arm.The research group’s 2007 report found migrants successfully bypassed, or in some cases went through, San Diego’s initial, primary fence in the early 1990s. That led to the construction of a triple-layer fence plus a more-than doubling of border patrol agents and an increase in technology used to stop the illegal entries.""Although much of this reduction in apprehensions in those stations and in San Diego sector may have been due to the construction of the triple-fence,"" the report said, ""the sector also saw an increase in other resources that may account for part of the reduction. For example, the number of agents assigned to the San Diego sector increased significantly during this period — from 980 agents in 1993 to 2,274 in 1998. Additionally, the number of underground sensors deployed in the San Diego sector almost tripled from 1993 to 1998, and the fleet of vehicles increased by over 150% over the same period.""David Shirk, professor of political science and international relations at the University of San Diego, said in an email that the added physical barriers in San Diego helped reduce illegal crossings.But the rapid increase in border agents also played a key role, Shirk said, by diverting ""migrants to other crossing points east of San Diego, in much more dangerous mountain and desert areas, causing thousands of people to die due to exposure to the elements over the last 25 years.""Avila, of the San Diego regional chamber, cited one more piece of the border picture: Tunnels. She said dozens of completed tunnels have been discovered under the San Diego border in recent decades, potentially skewing the number of illegal crossings and the notion that fencing alone prevents unauthorized migration.Our ratingPresident Trump claimed San Diego’s border fence ""almost completely ended illegal crossings.""He’s right that border patrol arrests have plunged, declining 96 percent along the San Diego sector, from 1986 to 2017. The biggest drop took place in the late 1990s, after a triple-layer barrier replaced an initial fence built in 1993.But experts on the border, along with a congressional report, show San Diego’s border fence was only one factor in helping reduce the crossings. A surge of border patrol agents, vehicles and technology along with improved economic opportunities in Mexico all played important roles.Trump’s statement ignores these key factors, giving credit only to the barrier.We rate his claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

Family members or law enforcement officials have to petition a judge to temporarily restrict a person’s access to firearms.The term comes from the idea the person’s behavior amounts to a ""red flag"" for danger.Since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, a total of 13 states have put such laws in place.When asked for backup for its claim via a Facebook message, the Wisconsin Firearms Coalition responded:""The Attorney General’s comments were in his inaugural address, the governor came out the next day in support of red flags, and Statewide media reports that Robin Voss is willing to look at the idea a day or two after that.""Let’s start with the elected officials.Positions of elected officialsFeatured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021In his Jan. 7, 2019 inaugural speech, Kaul called for taking steps to make schools safer, and mentioned red flag laws as one way to do so.Of red-flag laws, he said, they will ""allow law enforcement or family members to go to a judge and ensure that somebody who is a threat to themselves or others is temporarily disarmed.""In a story posted Jan. 10, 2019 on the website for Wausau-based WAOW-TV, Evers backed Kaul’s position and was quoted saying: ""Anytime we have an ability to take a firearm from somebody who may not be able to handle a firearm because of various in-capabilities, we need to investigate that.""The same article included this line:Republican Assembly speaker Robin Vos said he’s open to considering a red flag law, but is concerned about the rights of gun owners.But that line, especially, is a far-cry from ""demanding"" the laws be put in place.Vos communications director Kit Beyer described the speaker as a staunch Second Amendment supporter and noted he has said he is ""fearful of taking away anyone’s constitutional rights"" when it comes to such laws.On Jan. 22, 2019, in a response to Evers’ State of the State address, Vos was more firm.""I promise you: Republicans will fight for and protect your freedom, from unnecessary red flag gun laws,"" he said.So, the group’s claim is largely on the money with Evers and Kaul, but mischaracterizes Vos’ position.The bigger pictureThere are bigger problems with the main thrust of the claim -- that the laws would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process.""Adam Winkler, a law professor and specialist in constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said red-flag laws require a neutral arbiter to order confiscation of an individual’s firearms.""A judge has to determine that a person is a threat,"" Winkler said.That undercuts the central thrust of the claim -- that there is zero oversight.That said, affected individuals could have their guns taken away temporarily without the ability to defend their position by appearing in court -- if a judge finds the concerns raised are severe enough.After the temporary period ends, the judge can review the case. At this stage, the individual would typically be involved in a hearing.Winkler said the laws are controversial, in part, because of due process concerns.""You’re taking away fundamental rights without participation,"" he said. ""American courts are reluctant to take away guns unless (an individual) has been convicted of a crime.""So, the thrust of the claim overstates -- by a lot -- the way the laws work.Our ratingA gun rights group claimed ""Governor Evers, AG Josh Kaul, and Speaker Robin Vos are demanding ""Red Flag Gun Seizures"" for Wisconsin"" which would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!""Though there is some truth to the claim, in that Kaul and Evers have clearly voiced support, the group was wrong about Vos’ position. The claim goes well beyond the facts in stating there is zero oversight of any action under such laws.Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.","https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/rally-at-wisconsin-capitol-against-gun-control-laws-met-with/article_6768055e-7302-5beb-ab55-f8b79d0d4639.html,https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/gun-rights-advocates-counter-protesters-set-for-competing-capitol-protests/article_f88b70d1-b875-5962-9cf5-b7024ed9b71f.html,https://www.facebook.com/WisconsinFirearmsCoalition/,https://www.wisconsinfirearmscoalition.org/about-us/,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://waow.com/news/2019/01/10/wisconsin-attorney-general-calls-for-red-flag-gun-law/",,"Constitutional Amendments,States,Guns,Wisconsin,Wisconsin Firearms Coalition",,,,,

Bush signed it and Obama was supposed to oversee its construction. Where is the money?""These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Here’s the problem with the missing money claims: Congress did not approve $50 billion for a fence in 2006. (Snopes previously debunked these social media posts.)Congress approved $1.2 billion for fence in 2006Just over half of Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, including Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Most Democrats in the House voted against it, including California Rep. Nancy Pelosi. President George W. Bush signed it into law in October 2006.The law authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2015, 654 miles were completed.We read several news stories about the act’s passage in 2006. None pegged the cost anywhere near $50 billion.The Secure Fence Act didn’t mention money to be spent on fencing.Congress separately approved a $33.7 billion spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which included  $1.2 billion for fencing, infrastructure and technology on the border.The $1.2 billion was described in news articles as a down payment, but there was disagreement about how much the full fence would cost. Newspapers and politicians cited estimates between $2 billion and $12 billion.Source of the $50 billion figureSo where did this idea of $50 billion come from? It’s not very straightforward.In January 2007, multiple news reports and an article by the Migration Policy Institute started to mention a pot of about $50 billion for fencing.These reports reference the work of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021About a week before the final September Senate vote, the researchers issued a report that explored costs and benefits of southwest border fencing, a ""relatively new and limited phenomenon.""They placed the initial cost of building a double-layer fence at $1.2 million to $1.3 million per mile, citing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Over 25 years, the costs per mile could increase anywhere from $16 million to $70 million per mile depending on the degree of wear and tear.But neither the report nor a December 2006 update calculate the total cost. The latter document references the $1.2 billion that was appropriated to Homeland Security.The Migration Policy Institute did include $50 billion total by taking the highest figures in the CRS report — $1.3 million per mile for construction and $70 million per mile for maintenance — and then multiply $71.3 million by 700 miles to get about $49.9 billion.Once it hit the newspapers, the $50 billion figure sparked some pushback.US Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said, ""These numbers are grossly inflated.""California Republican U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter criticized the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: ""I call them the 'Mission Impossible' crowd,"" he said.The talking point that the Congressional Research Service said the fence would cost $50 billion was repeated for years, reappearing in Mother Jones in 2011, Newsweek in 2015 and the Boston Globe in 2017.The figure has resurfaced during the current debate over Trump’s wall.U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a Jan. 2 Fox News op-ed that 26 Senate Democrats ""voted for The Secure Fence Act, which allocated $50 billion over 25 years for 700 miles of fencing along the border.""Fox News’ Sean Hannity said on Jan. 9, ""The Secure Fence Act allowed over $50 billion over the next two decades to construct and maintain hundreds of miles of new barriers.""The Government Accountability Office said that Border Patrol spent about $2.3 billion to deploy fencing between fiscal years 2007 through 2015 and constructed 654 miles of fencing by 2015. Border Patrol officials did not track funding for acquisition and sustainment for border fencing prior to the implementation of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In 2009, Border Patrol estimated that maintaining fencing would cost more than $1 billion over 20 years.Our rulingSocial media posts asked, ""Where is the $50 billion approved in ‘06 for the Secure Fence Act that Obama was supposed to build?""These posts falsely suggest that Congress approved $50 billion as part of the Secure Fence Act. Actually the Homeland Security appropriations bill  included $1.2 billion for the fence, described as a down payment at the time.The claim that $50 billion was approved seems to come from estimates for the total wall that circulated among researchers and journalists.These social media posts try to suggest that Congress did something nefarious by approving the money and not spending it, but there is no evidence that Congress ever approved $50 billion for a wall.We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d9e4344-6e9a-4cb7-8f94-dc14e97a3750","https://www.facebook.com/lillie.pearlman/posts/1207723432726777,https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk/status/1085299575731224576,https://www.facebook.com/lillie.pearlman/posts/1207723432726777,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2021759287899867&set=a.106836366058845&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/secure-fence-act-50-billion-border/,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/109-2006/s262,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/109-2006/h446,https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/6061/text,https://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/30/nation/na-immig30,https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ295/PLAW-109publ295.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901912.html,http://www.newson6.com/story/7645847/border-bills-come-up-short-when-its-time-to-pay-for-them,https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Study-Price-for-border-fence-up-to-49-billion-2625039.php,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jan/16/20070116-101145-5622r/,https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/new-congress-takes-first-steps-toward-immigration-reform,https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P1065.pdf,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a360954.pdf,https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20061212_RL33659_b4b5ded81978af6aeae64a3e4f2eab498bd1a3db.pdf,https://www.theledger.com/news/20070113/lawmakers-border-fence-costs-are-inflated,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jan/16/20070116-101145-5622r/,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/herman-cain-border-electric-fence/,https://www.newsweek.com/2015/10/23/myths-half-truths-about-immigration-reform-382855.html,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/01/26/when-wall-was-fence-and-democrats-embraced/QE7ieCBXjXVxO63pLMTe9O/story.html,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-steve-scalise-democrats-need-to-stop-playing-games-with-americas-safety-fund-border-security-now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwoO1v3FH0w,https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/682838.pdf,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d9e4344-6e9a-4cb7-8f94-dc14e97a3750",,"Immigration,Fake news,Federal Budget,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts",,,,,

It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!""We fact-checked a similar claim in a November Trump tweet and rated it False:""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,"" Trump charged.We'll review the facts on what causes California's fires, and rate Trump's latest claim.Our researchCalifornia’s firestorms aren’t caused by just one factor. Instead, climate change, forest management and urban sprawl all contribute, according to forestry, fire and climate experts.   Thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush can help reduce the severity of fires. But California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions, all attributed to climate change, make fires worse. So does the fact that more people and power lines are now situated in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno.""It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error,"" Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, told us in November.Additionally, Trump’s claim suggests the state controls most forest management decisions. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent.  The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021Responses to Trump’s tweetCalifornia Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice responded in a statement on Tuesday to Trump’s tweet:""The president’s attempt to pin sole blame for California’s wildfire problems on the state’s forest management is flat wrong. While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California. And yet, the federal government has cut $2 billion from the US Forest Service even as California has spent more on forest management.""Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents Butte County where the Camp Fire destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 86 people in November, said he shares ""the President’s great frustration with California’s choking regulations from the stranglehold environmental groups have on the state,"" and the need for more forest management.The congressman added, however, ""the immediate problem for fire victims is the first need, and threats to FEMA funding are not helpful and will not solve the longer term forest management regulatory problems.""Democratic Gov.

The conflict escalated and became more complicated, as different groups within the country and foreign countries — not to mention terrorist groups — got involved.In the complex struggle for power, Russia and Iran back the Syrian government. The United States supports opposition groups. The United States has long accused the Syrian government of atrocities against its own people, including a chemical weapons attack in April 2017 that killed more than 80 people.The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria supporting Syrian Kurds fighting the Islamic State terrorist group. Trump claimed via a tweet that ISIS had been defeated in Syria, and so U.S. troops no longer needed to be there.The senators who objected to Trump’s decision disagreed with his assessment about ISIS.

Quite the opposite.At an annual press conference on Dec. 20, Putin said he agreed with Trump’s claim that ISIS had been defeated.Putin said he did not think the presence of American troops was required in Syria. He argued that U.S. presence there was illegitimate because it was not approved by a United Nations Security Council resolution, and because the Syrian government did not invite the United States into its country.""Russian troops were invited by the Syrian Government,"" Putin said, according to the transcript posted on the Kremlin website. ""The United States did not get either of these so if they decide to withdraw their troops, it is the right decision.""Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, on Dec. 19 also welcomed Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria.

""Once Americans were there, there was no such hope.""The Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focuses on international public policy issues, said in a Q&A post about Trump’s decision that throughout the conflict in Syria, the United States has been working with Syrians and outside groups to negotiate the country’s political future. Parallel processes led by Russia in recent years seem to have overtaken the U.S.-sponsored discussions, the group said.""With the precipitate U.S. withdrawal from Syria, the U.S. position in any negotiations over Syria’s future has been inestimably weakened,"" wrote analysts Jon B. Alterman and Will Todman with the center’s Middle East program. ""Perhaps most puzzling, U.S. adversaries have sacrificed nothing to obtain that outcome.""Brett McGurk, a special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told reporters on Dec. 11, before Trump’s announcement, that he thought it was ""fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring.""Brian Finlay, president and CEO at Stimson Center, a nonpartisan policy research center, told PolitiFact that the ""vast preponderance of foreign policy thinkers"" seem to agree with McGurk. ""While it is clear that the president's critics are quite correct in saying those conditions have been far from met, it's also difficult to imagine a scenario where those pieces will ever be locked in place,"" Finlay said.U.S. withdrawal from Syria will leave ""a significant vacuum in the region,"" Finlay said, which Russia, Syria, and Iran will seek to exploit.The Associated Press also reported Dec. 20 that a Syrian member of parliament, Peter Marjana, described the United States’ withdrawal from Syria as a ""recognition that Syria has won.""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, it was accurate that the principal attempted to ban candy canes, but the district reversed her ban.Leading up to the holiday season, the principal at Manchester Elementary School in Nebraska, Jennifer Sinclair, sent a staff memo outlining rules for the holiday season. Her list included ""not acceptable"" items or practices for the classroom including Santa or Christmas art on worksheets, Christmas music and books and ornaments.Then she provided the guidance on candy:""Candy Cane — that’s Christmas-related. Historically, the shape is a ‘J’ for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.""Sinclair listed several winter symbols as ""acceptable"" including hot chocolate, snowmen, gingerbread people, and Olaf, the snowman from ""Frozen.""She signed the memo as ""The (Unintentional) Grinch who stole Christmas (from Manchester).""The Liberty Counsel, a national conservative Christian organization based in Florida, heard about the memo and fired off a letter Nov. 30 to district? Superintendent Bary Habrock asking him to ""disavow the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items."" The Liberty Counsel included the text of Sinclair’s memo in its letter, which then drew national media attention.The Liberty Counsel said that the ban showed ""hostility toward Christianity"" and violated the district’s own policy, which allows teaching about religion. While the district policy doesn’t mention candy canes per se, it does say ""Christmas trees, Santa Claus and Easter eggs and bunnies are considered to be secular, seasonal symbols and may be displayed as teaching aids provided they do not disrupt the instructional program for students."" (The Anti-Defamation League, a national group that fights against anti-semitism, recommends that if a school has holiday decorations, ""they should represent the diversity of the season and should avoid symbols with patently religious meanings to avoid sending the message to students that a religion or a particular denomination is preferred."")Mat Staver, founder of the Liberty Counsel, told PolitiFact that the school district said Sinclair’s memo was not consistent with district policy.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021Principal Sinclair later sent an email to parents apologizing for the staff memo, saying the information she initially provided was incorrect, according to WOWT TV.Elkhorn school district spokeswoman Kara Perchal told PolitiFact that Sinclair was placed on administrative leave Dec. 6. Sinclair is in her first year at the school district. PolitiFact was unable to reach Sinclair — a person in the school office said she currently has no voicemail or email.""Dr. Sinclair's memo did state that candy canes could not be used; however, this information was in direct opposition to our district policy regarding holiday symbols in the classroom,"" she said.Origin of candy canes not religiousSinclair ascribed religious significance to the candy cane, from its shape to its red and white stripes.Our fact-checking friends at Snopes found statements that candy canes were created as Christian symbols representing the blood and purity of Jesus are false. (The original Snopes report was in 2000 and the website updated the story in 2017.)The National Confectioners Association’s article about the history of candy canes makes no mention of Jesus. It says, according to legend, in 1670 a choirmaster in Germany handed out sugar sticks to his young singers and had the candies bent into shepherds’ crooks. It wasn’t until the turn of the century that the red and white stripes and peppermint flavors became the norm.The association wrote that In the 1920s, Bob McCormack began making candy canes as Christmas treats. In the 1950s, Bob’s brother-in-law, Gregory Keller, a Catholic priest, invented a machine to automate candy cane production.Susan Benjamin, author of ""Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America's Favorite Pleasure,"" told the Charleston Gazette-Mail in 2015 that there have been various rumors about the origins of candy canes.But she told the Gazette-Mail that candy canes are not a symbol of Jesus.""The candy cane is not a ‘J,’ the red is not meant to represent the blood of Jesus,"" said Benjamin, founder of True Treats Historic Candy, based in Harpers Ferry, W.V.Our rulingSeveral news articles and websites said that a school principal banned candy canes. A principal wrote a memo to staff banning candy canes and said it was a symbol of Jesus. Comments by the school district show that this was no holiday tale.Ultimately, it's important to know the school quickly reversed the ban. So we rate this Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/069f5186-7879-4271-916b-72c177481588","https://innerstrengthzone.com/life/principal-bans-candy-canes-because-j-shape-stands-for-jesus/?fbclid=IwAR1HcRbxkom-vxbj63IQn3kgFOgRux9F0qqNYtSypniUtI_H8RwPAie5gjA,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,http://lc.org/120318ElkhornList.pdf,http://lc.org/120418LtrtoElkhornPublicSchoolsreChristmasBan.pdf,https://www.elkhornweb.org/blog/policy/series-600-instruction/604-instructional-curriculum/policy-604-05-public-performances-and-exhibits/administrative-rules-and-procedures-to-implement-policy-604-05/,https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/december-dilemma-holiday-guidelines-for-public-schools#decorating-public-school-classrooms-and-grounds-with-holiday-symbols,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,https://www.wowt.com/content/news/Elkhorn-Public-Schools-addresses-internal-memo-at-elementary-school-banning-Christmas-decorations-502036702.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/raising-cane/,https://alwaysatreat.com/candy-canes/,https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/historian-shares-the-origin-stories-of-christmas-candy/article_961f2c73-45e7-5ecb-8d7d-70a158d3ea09.html,http://www.truetreatscandy.com/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/069f5186-7879-4271-916b-72c177481588",,"Education,Fake news,Religion,Facebook Fact-checks,Bloggers",,,,,

Everyone in poverty now has health care""",,politifact,,"Editor's note, Dec. 4, 2018: This item has been updated to note that Wisconsin is the only state, among those who did not do the Obamacare expansion, without a so-called coverage gap.Both sides in the political divide have used health care as a major talking point, with heated arguments ranging from coverage of pre-existing conditions to Medicare for All proposals.Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, has raised an issue that piqued the interest of PolitiFact Wisconsin.""We have the number one health care system in the country,"" said Kooyenga, referring to the state of Wisconsin. ""Everyone in poverty now has health care.""Kooyenga’s comment came Nov. 7, 2018, on the ""Mark Belling Show"" on WISN-AM.The day before, Kooyenga had won the seat that Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir gave up to run unsuccessfully against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.Let’s see what Kooyenga is talking about.The evidenceWhen asked to provide backup for the claim, Kooyenga staffer Rachel Vander Wiele pointed to a Sept. 2, 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin item that rated a similar claim from Gov. Scott Walker.The claim: That even though Walker ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid.""We rated the statement Mostly True.The item noted that 145,000 people gained coverage as a result of the extra action. What’s more, Wisconsin is the only state among those that did not do the Obamacare expansion without a coverage gap, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health-care-related matters.Vander Wiele also cited a Nov. 1, 2017, news item issued by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine: ""Wisconsin has best health care quality in the nation, federal agency says.""The item noted that according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Wisconsin had the best health care quality in the nation, based on a ranking of 130 measures.Digging into the rankingsIt is true that Wisconsin was ranked No. 1 in 2017. But the information is outdated.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021In the latest such report, released in September 2018, Maine ranked first, with Wisconsin coming in fourth. Reasons cited for Wisconsin’s dip included a high rate of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for opioid-related conditions.Stephanie Marquis, vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Hospital Association, noted that the state has generally fared well in the AHRQ rankings -- first in the nation in 2006, 2008 and 2017 and second in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2015. Marquis also pointed out that the 2018 ranking was still tops among Midwestern states.Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said ranking the health care systems of states is a complicated issue.""The results depend a great deal on what is being measured and how various measures are aggregated to derive a final score,"" Dyck said.""Everyone in poverty now has health care""According to the Kaiser Family Foundation more than two million poor, uninsured adults nationally fall into the ""coverage gap"" that results from state decisions not to expand Medicaid. That means their income is above current Medicaid eligibility, but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits. These individuals would be eligible for Medicaid had their state chosen to expand coverage.Because Wisconsin sets the income limit for Medicaid at the federal poverty level, does that mean that everyone under the poverty line has coverage?  There is a small wrinkle here.Remember: While Walker focused on people ""covered"" by Medicaid, as in eligible for it, Kooyenga stated ""Everyone in poverty now has health care.""  Dyck, of the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau, noted that while a person may meet financial requirements to enroll in Medicaid, there are other requirements that are not tied to finances.As an example, he cited a person who immigrates to the United States ""and resides in Wisconsin is generally not eligible for Medicaid until five years after entering the country, even if he or she becomes a naturalized citizen and meets the income eligibility standard.""Meanwhile, there are other sources that show there are people without insurance in the state.According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey, an estimated 309,404 people out of a population of more than 5.7 million, or 5.4 percent, are uninsured. The Census Bureau also estimates about 60,000 residents under the federal poverty level are uninsured.Our ratingKooyenga said Wisconsin has ""the number one health care system in the country. Everyone in poverty now has health care.""The state did receive a top rating in 2017, but in a more recent rating by the same agency the state had slipped to number four. Meanwhile, changes under Walker mean that everyone in poverty (and somewhat above) is eligible for coverage under Medicaid.But clearly there are still residents who do not have insurance.For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc55fa92-5884-40d0-a667-92b614c10778","https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-the-mark-belling-show-24992319/episode/11718-guests-scott-fitzgerald-dale-30120251/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-covered-everyone-poverty-medi/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-covered-everyone-poverty-medi/,https://vitalsigns.medicine.wisc.edu/federal-agency-ranks-wisconsin-1-health-care-quality,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/,https://nhqrnet.ahrq.gov/inhqrdr/Wisconsin/snapshot/summary/All_Measures/All_Topics,https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/3-AaCv2xPoU7Wzq5XSQ0cgK?domain=wha.org,https://www.wha.org/WisconsinHospitalAssociation/media/NewsRelease/2018PDF/WHArelease-AHRQrankings_09-24-2018.pdf,https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/,https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_S2701&prodType=table,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc55fa92-5884-40d0-a667-92b614c10778",,"Health Care,Medicaid,Medicare,Public Health,Wisconsin,Dale Kooyenga",,,,,

They want out.""",,politifact,,"President Donald Trump sought to make immigration the centerpiece of the closing days of the 2018 midterm elections. One of his biggest targets was sanctuary cities -- a somewhat fuzzy term that refers to localities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities.We previously rated Pants on Fire a statement by Trump at a campaign rally. He said that in California, ""they're rioting now"" over sanctuary cities. Officials said there was zero evidence for that claim.But are Californians unhappy about sanctuary cities, short of actually rioting over them? Trump had made that claim at a rally in Wheeling, W.Va., on Sept. 29.""If you want to secure our border, if you want to stop sanctuary cities, which even in California now, they don’t want to be sanctuary cities anymore,"" Trump said. ""They want out. You see it. They’re rebelling! In California of all places they’re rebelling.""We found that Californians’ views on sanctuary cities present a more complicated picture.California became a so-called sanctuary state in October 2017 when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities on immigration holds.On the one hand, the San Jose Mercury News reported in April that ""at least 14 Southern California cities and two counties have passed ordinances, and in some cases filed lawsuits,"" against the statewide sanctuary law.But these localities are home to a small fraction of Californians, and public opinion data shows that residents are generally supportive of sanctuary laws, as we’ve previously reported.• A November 2017 University of Southern California Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey found 53 percent favored and 29 percent opposed California’s sanctuary state legislation.• A March 2017 University of California Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that 56 percent supported and 44 percent opposed ""local communities declaring themselves sanctuary cities and instructing local police and government employees not to automatically turn immigrants over to federal immigration officers when they are found to be in the country illegally."" Support was weaker when the question was asked differently: 53 percent opposed and 47 percent supported allowing cities and counties the right to ignore requests from federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are about to be released.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021• A May 2017 Public Policy Institute of California poll asked specifically about California’s sanctuary state legislation. It found 48 percent of adults were in favor and 42 percent were opposed.• A January 2017 Public Policy Institute of California survey showed that 58 percent of likely voters ""favor California’s state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions—separate from the federal government— to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants living in the state."" Only 39 percent said they were opposed.• The most recent poll, released in April 2018 by the University of California Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, found 56 percent percent support for California’s law and 41 percent in opposition. Opinions are strong both for and against: 38 percent said they strongly support it and 32 percent said they strongly oppose it.Mark DiCamillo, the director of the IGS survey, told PolitiFact California earlier this year that opinions about sanctuary policies ""vary according to how you frame the issue.""Californians, he said, favor allowing cities to declare themselves sanctuaries and letting them choose not to automatically turn over immigrants to federal authorities. But, he added, ""just ignoring a federal request is not as popular. It’s very divisive.""""There are nuances to the issue, in my opinion, that affect public opinion and how it’s gauged,"" he said.Experts added that the increasing identification of Trump himself with opposition to sanctuary cities has made the issue more polarized on a partisan basis. In California, which is a strongly Democratic state overall, this has helped line public opinion against Trump’s position.Our rulingTrump said, ""Even in California now, they don’t want to be sanctuary cities anymore.

""Money raised to help O’Rourke get elected is being used to fund migrants. This is clearly breaking campaign finance laws.""This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) CrowdTangle data shows it had been shared on Facebook more than 16,000 times as of Election Day.The Patriot Journal doesn’t have contact information on its website, and the publication did not immediately respond to a Facebook message seeking more information about its story.However, its claim seems to stem from a video posted to YouTube on Nov. 1 by Project Veritas, an organization that creates undercover sting videos of its targets, including media organizations. (Patriot Journal embedded the video in its story.)The approximately 24-minute video is titled: ""Nobody needs to know: Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies for caravan aliens,"" and it shows clips of campaign staffers talking about buying food and giving rides to immigrants.  ""For me, I can ignore the rules,"" a field manager says near the beginning. ""I don’t mind breaking the rules and I can defend any position.""""Don’t ever repeat this and stuff but, like, if we just say that we’re buying food for a campaign event, like the Halloween events, cause there’s block walks coming up for Halloween,"" a field organizer is recorded saying a few moments later.When the undercover Project Veritas staffer says, ""I know that we’re using some of the campaign resources to help with the migrants and like I just didn’t want anybody to get in trouble with that, like I didn’t want them to ask me any questions about people using resources,"" O’Rourke’s campaign manager says, ""Don’t worry.""James O’Keefe, the conservative activist behind Project Veritas, is then shown in El Paso explaining to viewers what he says the videos mean.""The videos that you’re about to see appear to show Beto’s campaign workers and his staff all the way up to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, knowingly using campaign resources and funds to help assist, subsidize illegal aliens entering the United States, some of them from the migrant caravan,"" O’Keefe says.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021A later clip of the field manager shows him talking to another staffer about ""that migrant caravan.""""A few of them got here already and they’re dropping them off like really close to Missouri,"" he says. (Missouri is the name of a street in El Paso.) The staffer then says the migrants are ""the Hondurans.""In response to an email seeking more information about the allegations, O’Rourke’s campaign forwarded this statement from Nov. 2: ""Ted Cruz shamefully and falsely suggested that the Beto for Texas campaign used campaign dollars to fund a caravan that remains hundreds of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.""The campaign also pointed PolitiFact to two news stories in the Texas Tribune and the El Paso Times.The Tribune story, posted online Nov. 2, reports that the campaign said staffers recently ""took it upon themselves"" to use campaign funds to donate supplies to an El Paso nonprofit. The campaign said the contributions, totaling less than $300, will be ""appropriately reported"" to the Federal Election Commission, according to the story.O’Rourke’s campaign said the staffers were responding to an unrelated situation in which the federal government dropped off more than 100 migrants seeking asylum at a bus station in downtown El Paso, the Tribune reports.  The El Paso Times reported on Nov. 2 that Chris Evans, a spokesman for the campaign, said staffers used prepaid credit cards to buy ""wipes, diapers, water, fruit and granola bars"" and donated them to Annunciation House, a nonprofit that provides support to immigrants.But it’s not illegal to donate campaign funds to a nonprofit as long as the parties abide by this rule: The organization can’t compensate the candidate—if it’s going to at all—before using or spending the entire donation, according to FEC. In other words, the donation can’t personally benefit the candidate.The Tribune also talked to a campaign finance expert, Paul S. Ryan with the government watchdog group Common Cause. He told the publication that unless the donations are improperly reported to the FEC, they don’t break any laws.So here’s what we know:Though in the video a campaign staffer talks about helping Honduran immigrants, describing them as members of the migrant caravan who recently arrived in El Paso, the caravan was still hundreds of miles away as of Nov. 5.The campaign says that staffers did use funds to help migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Annunciation House, where the campaign said the goods were donated, has been assisting families released from federal detention centers following background checks and fingerprinting, according to the El Paso Times.Still, though the ""staffers are shown expressing awareness that what they are doing is improper, or at least could be perceived as improper,"" the Tribune reports, the campaign doesn’t appear to be breaking the law unless it fails to properly report its donations to the FEC.We rate this statement as False.

Scott Walker’s health care policy.Health insurance has been a key issue throughout the campaign — Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in federal court in Texas to try to make that happen.Meanwhile, Walker offered a last-minute proposal on pre-existing conditions, saying he would codify into state law the same protections offered by the ACA.Speaking Nov. 1, 2018, in Eau Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, then pivoted to new anti-Walker claim.""How many students here are still under their parents' health care (insurance)? There’s more than a handful,"" Evers said, then added: ""He wants to get rid of that, too.""Does Walker really want to force students off their parents’ health insurance?Evers offers no specific evidenceAsked for back up for the claim, Evers spokesman Sam Lau pointed only to Walker’s opposition to the ACA, commonly called Obamacare.""The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay on your parents’ health care until you are 26, and Walker is suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,"" Lau said.True enough.The Affordable Care Act does require that insurers offering dependent child coverage make that coverage available until the child turns 26.But Wisconsin law also has a similar – though less comprehensive – requirement that would remain in place even if the ACA is repealed. The provision was put into place as part of the 2011-’13 budget, based on wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with ACA requirements.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021The Wisconsin language would not apply to employer-sponsored insurance that is self-funded — about half the employer plans in the state. That exemption, which is part of federal law, means half the employer plans wouldn’t be required to cover children up to age 26, said Jon Peacock, research director for Kids Forward, a Madison-based advocacy group.Nevertheless, Walker has already signed a provision that does what Evers says Walker opposes -- provides the ability for ""kids"" to be on the health plans of their parents. What's more, past statements from Walker have gone further. And Walker campaign spokesman Ben Voelkel said the governor continues to support leaving the provision as it is in the ACA.He cited several articles, including an Aug. 18, 2015 one from the website Becker’s Hospital Review. That article, in the midst of Walker’s brief presidential campaign, looked at key points from Walker’s plan to replace the ACA.Among the points noted: ""Under his proposal, Americans would not be fined for not having health insurance and those under 26 years old can stay on their parents' plans.""He also noted a 2017 Washington Post interview, in which Walker identified coverage ""for young people"" as among the things he’d keep from the Affordable Care Act if he were creating new policy after a repeal.Our ratingEvers says Walker ""wants to get rid of"" students’ ability to stay on their parents’ health insurance.But Evers offers no direct evidence of that claim.The only evidence offered — that Walker opposes the ACA, which also includes coverage through age 26 — does not logically connect. It’s not reasonable to extrapolate from Walker’s opposition of the ACA that he opposes each and every individual policy position within it.And the claim ignores the fact that Walker has already signed into law a requirement that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26.We rate Evers’ claim False.Editor's note: This item was updated on Nov. 5, 2018 to reflect information from Joe Peacock of the Kids Forward about how the provision in state law compares to the ACA.

Peter Roskam, a key architect of the landmark overhaul, is fighting for his seat against Democratic challenger Sean Casten.The two met for their final televised debate last week, and afterwards we gave Roskam a Pants on Fire! for making a claim about a Washington Post fact-check he said debunked attacks over his position on safeguarding health insurance protections for those with pre-existing conditions. No such fact-check exists.At that same debate, Casten also leveled a claim that left us puzzled. It involved the tax law, which Roskam accused the Democrat of misrepresenting.""Sean has also taken on a tactic of going door to door out in the western suburbs putting notice [sic] on people’s homes telling them that their taxes are going to go up,"" the Republican said. ""And that’s not true.""Casten then rattled off numbers in an effort to demonstrate that he, not Roskam, was the truth-teller when it came to the tax law. ""If you live in Hinsdale, Illinois, your average state and local taxes are $45,000 a year,"" Casten said. ""You are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000.""For starters, Casten’s choice of words was murky. Did he mean Hinsdale taxpayers were facing a $35,000 increase on their tax bills? Or did he mean that $35,000 more of their income was now exposed to being taxed because of Roskam and his fellow Republicans?More broadly, though, we wondered if Casten might be right that most Hinsdale residents will pay more under the GOP law.Deceptive dataThe first questions are easy to answer. A Casten spokeswoman pointed us to IRS data that made it clear that when he invoked the term double-taxing he did not intend to suggest that average tax bills were going up by $35,000.For 2015, Hinsdale residents who took the so-called SALT deduction for state income and property taxes claimed an average for that category of more than $48,000. The next year the average claim in Hinsdale was nearly $44,000.The new tax law now caps SALT deductions at $10,000, meaning that roughly $35,000 would have been disallowed for deductions each year if the rules had been in effect in 2015 and 2016.But it’s important to note that the SALT cap doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The tax overhaul made a number of other changes, from lowering federal tax rates to raising or allowing more people to benefit from various exemptions and credits.In Hinsdale, where the 2016 median income was $173,500 according to census figures, it’s likely a number of residents stand to benefit from other alterations in the law, among them an expanded credit for children and a doubling of the standard deduction.Casten’s argument also relies on the tax experience of an average Hinsdale resident, which is misleading on multiple levels.Nearly 40 percent of filers in Hinsdale didn’t itemize deductions on their 2016 returns, opting instead to take the standard deduction. The SALT cap is likely to mean nothing to these filers in the future, since they didn’t take the deduction in the first place.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021Hinsdale may be a well-to-do suburb, but those at the very top of the income heap benefit far more from itemizing their deductions than do everybody else. IRS data show that 37 percent of tax filers in Hinsdale listed income of $200,000 or more in 2016, yet those filers accounted for nearly 82 percent of dollars claimed for itemized deductions that year.""You’re not talking about the typical person in that particular jurisdiction,"" said Jon Davis, an expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who directs that school's Institute of Government & Public Affairs. ""You’re talking about an average, which is skewed. That in itself can be misleading to the public.""Tax hike or tax cut?The broader question posed by Casten’s claim is whether the average Hinsdale resident would be hit by an actual tax increase because of the actions of Roskam and his fellow Republicans. That’s what fliers posted around Hinsdale and several other towns by Casten’s campaign contend.""Your tax bill could increase an average of $19,169 due to the loss of State and Local Property Tax (SALT) deductions,"" the fliers read.To back up that claim, Casten’s spokeswoman sent us a spreadsheet detailing the campaign’s calculations. The spreadsheet, however, makes it clear that $19,169 figure refers to a diminished SALT deduction, not a tax increase.""The disallowed deduction is not the tax effect,"" Davis, the accounting expert, said. ""The tax effect is the disallowed deduction times the tax rate.""In short, the campaign fell short in basic math. But even if they had done it correctly, other provisions in the tax law mean an increase in federally taxable income due to the SALT cap won’t necessarily translate into a tax hike for many in Hinsdale or other communities in the congressional district.The Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group with a solid reputation for number-crunching, created an online calculator that attempts to account for the tax law changes, including the SALT cap.To test it out, we plugged in information for a married couple making $200,000 with no children who itemized their return but filed only for SALT with the average itemized amount for state and local taxes in Hinsdale. Even in that limited situation, the Tax Foundation calculates such a family would receive a tax cut of about $1,000 under the new law.Add two children and the savings increase to $5,000, thanks to the law’s expanded child tax credit.Our rulingCasten said that under the GOP tax law, ""if you live in Hinsdale, Illinois … you are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000.""His vague debate comment suggests — and fliers his campaign have posted around the area claim — that because of the cap on SALT deductions, residents could be hit with massive increases on their tax bill for 2018.But Casten’s statement ignores the reality that the calculation of any tax averages for Hinsdale are heavily skewed by a minority of residents who are very wealthy. It also fails to recognize the many other factors at play in the new tax law.The Republican overhaul made several changes to past tax law, some of which may come as a benefit to taxpayers and some of which may not. By focusing only on the downside, and exaggerating its impact at that, Casten’s claim greatly distorts the tax situation for the constituents he seeks to serve.We rate his claim False.","https://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2018/oct/28/peter-roskam/roskam-fibs-about-facts-and-fact-checks-his-health/,https://www.facebook.com/wttw11/videos/267301807310852/,https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-return-form-1040-statistics,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/no-biden-has-not-signed-45-capital-gains-tax-or-in/,https://taxfoundation.org/2018-tax-reform-calculator/",,"Taxes,Illinois,Sean Casten",,,,,

DeSantis was sworn into Congress in January 2013 and resigned in September to focus on his gubernatorial campaign.The story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign — the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis ""would make a great governor of Florida."" The story also doesn’t say that his spending broke House rules or laws.The crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn’t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money.""Without receipts, it remains unclear how many trips DeSantis took at taxpayer expense to make media appearances. It's also difficult without those records to know how often he traveled at taxpayer expense to locations other than his Florida district or Washington office,"" the Naples Daily News story said.Funds come from the Members' Representational AllowanceThe money at issue comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. The amount appropriated can vary per year. During his time in office, DeSantis’ allowance was more than $1 million but not more than $1.4 million.Authorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses.The funds cannot be used to pay for expenses ""related to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses, or House committee expenses,"" and members may be held personally liable for misspent funds or excess spending, said a September 2017 Congressional Research Service report.House members’ spending is published in a quarterly public report called Statements of Disbursements. The Naples Daily News analyzed reports submitted by DeSantis and found more than $1,000 spent on seven hotel stays since 2013, and 71 commercial transportation expenses totaling about $143,000.DeSantis did not provide to the news outlet details on where and how long he stayed in the hotels; nor receipts on the commercial transportation that would detail where, when, why or with whom he traveled, how many trips were by plane or train, and whether he traveled first-class or coach.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021DeSantis’ campaign did not respond to multiple PolitiFact queries.New York City trips to appear on Fox NewsThe Naples Daily News identified travel expenses listed in DeSantis’ spending reports that matched the dates of at least two appearances on Fox News TV and radio shows, in July and October of 2017.

Some reported expenses are listed as ""commercial transportation,"" but do not specify when or where the trip was taken. At least two travel expenses reported by DeSantis match the dates of 2017 appearances on Fox News shows. DeSantis’ campaign said those were official media appearances, because he was answering questions as a House member and had not yet entered the governor’s race.DeSantis is not legally required to disclose detailed reports of his travel.

Porter has embraced the once-radical position of single-payer health care while Ocasio-Cortez supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.""Perhaps a minor alteration in the story, but it’s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer’s claim that Porter wants to abolish ICE.What Katie Porter has said about ICEDemocrats have argued in the past that ICE, which formed in the aftermath of 9/11, needs to be abolished to prevent mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. But the notion gained new life over the summer amid stories of migrant children being separated from their families at the U.S. border.Porter’s campaign said she does not want to abolish ICE. We did not find evidence that she has called for ending the agency like some other candidates.The campaign pointed us to a Mercury News article from August.The story discusses how none of the Democrats running in the 10 most competitive House races in California support dissolving the agency, citing a survey of the candidates.It then lists each candidate’s comments on ICE, and quotes Porter saying that the immigration agency ""should be focused on its core public safety mission, not targeting families.

But the Illinois Republican spent two decades in his state’s General Assembly before his 2014 election to Congress, and in one of those years -- 11 years ago -- he voted for a 9.6 percent pay raise for state lawmakers.You can guess where this is going.""While southern Illinois families struggled, Bost voted to raise his own pay."" So said a campaign ad from his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly.Is this true? The suggestion is that Bost took care of himself and his lawmaker friends rather than the taxpayers. But Bost’s record of voting against pay raises is much longer.The single voteIn 2007, the Illinois General Assembly was trying to pass a 75-page, multipart supplemental spending bill to fund schools, multiple state agencies and employee salaries. By the time it came up for a final vote, other lawmakers had included a measure to raise the assembly’s pay, with rank-and-file members’ salaries rising to $63,143 from $57,619. The Legislature had not received a raise, even one to cover cost-of-living increases, in several years, but this was controversial nevertheless because of claims that the state had bigger priorities, and limited resources.Supporters of the bill said its passage was essential -- not because of the pay raise but because the underlying bill contained multiple other state funding measures. That’s why Bost said he voted yes.He had voted no the previous year on a similar measure with a proposed 9.6 percent pay hike.Bost had also voted against pay raises numerous other times, his campaign and Illinois media said. WSIL-TV, an Illinois ABC affiliate, reported that while in the Illinois Legislature, ""Bost voted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times, and even voted to require furlough days for legislators, actually reducing compensation.""Featured Fact-checkIllinois Republican Partystated on February 5, 2021 in social media posts“Pritzker’s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities” puts prisoners, politicians and college students ahead of “individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.”By Kiannah Sepeda-Miller • February 12, 2021The Belleville News-Democrat, examining Illinois General Assembly documents, found the same thing in its own examination.Now in Congress nearly four years, Bost has voted to freeze congressional pay 12 times. The number of votes exceeds his time in Congress because annual spending bills typically go through several stages, requiring several votes.A nuanceThis is about pay raises, but inflation-linked cost-of-living, or COLA, increases are also a form of a raise. Unless blocked by the Legislature, Illinois grants COLA adjustments automatically, a result of an independent compensation board’s decision decades ago. When counting votes against pay raises, Bost and the Illinois media generally include Bost’s multiple votes to skip the COLA hikesBut there was an instance in 2010, confirmed by PolitiFact in Illinois legislative records, when Bost voted yes on a floor amendment to suspend a COLA hike and require legislators to take 12 furlough days -- yet when the measure got attached to a much broader budget bill, Bost voted no on that bill. He said he could not support the bill other reasons.Technically speaking, that meant he voted against the final legislators' COLA freeze and furlough.The same pay provisions came up the next year, however, in a clean bill pertaining only to lawmaker compensation -- and Bost voted for the cuts.Our rulingKelly's ad says Bost ""voted to raise his own pay."" There is one 2007 vote that is not in question. Bost’s campaign spokesman said Bost voted for the bill despite that distasteful element, because so many other provisions were essential for the state.But Bost voted repeatedly against other pay hikes -- not only the COLAs but a 9.6 percent proposed pay hike in a 2006 bill as well. If counting, those votes outnumbered the 2007 vote. Looking at his overall record gives a very different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Troy Balderson backs a ""massive tax giveaway"" for corporations ""by slashing Medicare and Social Security.""",,politifact,,"Lower corporate taxes beat high ones, many Republicans say, firm in the assertion that if companies can keep more of their earnings, they’ll spend it on jobs and expansion.Or else it’s all a sham to help their fat-cat contributors -- and ordinary Americans will have to pay later when their retirement benefits get shorted.The latter belief is the basis of a new ad from Danny O’Connor, the Democrat running in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District. He’s challenging Troy Balderson, a Republican who won the mid-Ohio seat temporarily after a special election in August 2018. Balderson was not in Congress when lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but he supported it.An announcer in O’Connor’s ad says, ""If you want to know who Troy Balderson works for, follow the money. An avalanche of corporate cash. Big banks. Drug companies. The insurance giants. Balderson backs a massive tax giveaway for them by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us.""These dots supposedly go from corporate donations to tax cuts for companies to slashed retirement programs. Let’s see where they actually lead.Basic factsThe basic facts on campaign contributions are simple and taken from public filings.Balderson is raising campaign money. Based on publicly filed campaign finance records through Sept. 10, he has raised nearly $1.8 million, with about $240,000 of it coming from political action committees of businesses. Whether that’s an ""avalanche of cash"" is relative, but for the sake of comparison, O’Connor, the candidate making the claim, has raised much more money: $5.5 million -- but he shuns money from corporate PACs.The ad’s announcer singles out three kinds of corporations. One is ""the insurance giants."" Yet nearly a quarter, or $11,900, of the industry’s total came from a single hometown insurer, Nationwide, based in Columbus, mostly from the company PAC.Balderson has received more than $30,000 from commercial banks so far. Yet the overwhelming share of it -- $15,500 -- was from another hometown company, Columbus-based Huntington Bancshares. O'Connor got $2,500 from Huntington's PAC in April but gave it back in June.Balderson got $14,900 from pharmaceutical and health products companies, records show. But 40 percent of that drug industry money, or $6,000, came from Cardinal Health, a Columbus-based pharmaceutical distributor.The 'giveaway'The ad then says Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for his corporate donorsThis refers to the corporate tax rate reductions in the late 2017 income tax overhaul. How do the tax cuts for corporations lead to ""slashing"" Medicare and Social Security?Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021There are two ways, if you follow this line of thinking. First, the tax cuts required the government to boost its borrowing, which means larger deficits.Second, Republicans in Congress including Balderson say they want a balanced budget. This would require changes in spending, and because the tax cuts pushed up deficits, even bigger spending cuts could be required, Democrats warn. House Republicans released a balanced-budget blueprint on June 19 laying out their ideas -- and explained how and why Social Security and Medicare would be affected if this plan came to pass:""The Federal Government is spending far more than it takes in,"" the document said. ""This increasing disparity is largely due to mandatory – or autopilot – spending, which includes safety-net programs like Medicare and Social Security, as well as the interest on the national debt."" That drives the ""rapid rate at which the national debt is accumulating.""To fix this, House Republicans would create a dual system that let seniors stay in tradional Medicare or enroll in private plans that would provide ""the same level of health coverage"" but ""compete for seniors’ business, just as Medicare Advantage does today,"" the House document said. This would create savings for seniors as well as taxpayers, the proposal said, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis of similar proposals in 2017.The CBO said savings or higher costs for seniors would depend on the program's design. But Medicare could save $537 billion over the next decade with these changes, Budget Committee Republicans estimated.As for Social Security, savings would come from eliminating the ability to collect unemployment benefits and Social Security disability insurance at the same time. This was projected to save up to $4 billion.Separately, President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sept. 17 that with budget deficits projected at about 4 percent to 5 percent of the country’s economic output for the next one to two years, there would likely be an effort in 2019 to cut spending on entitlement programs. He did not specify where the cuts would be made, Reuters reported. Trump, however, ran on promises not to cut Medicare or Social Security. Our rulingO’Connor’s ad says Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for his corporate donors, suggesting he ""works"" for them, ""by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us.""Balderson certainly takes campaign contributions from corporations.And Balderson supports corporate tax cuts, too. The entire tax package added to deficits -- which so far have been financed with higher federal borrowing, not cuts to retirement programs. Nevertheless, changes to those programs could come.But the idea of ""slashing"" Medicare or Social Security is not what’s been proposed. Rather, Republicans have suggested holding down their growth rate and allowing private accounts, with a lot of details still to come.PolitiFact has rated claims that say the tax cuts will lead to Social Security and Medicare cuts as Half True, reasoning that policies like the tax cuts and balanced budget bills could make cuts more likely, though not certain.But O’Connor went further. His ad said Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for corporations ""by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us."" It’s speculative, scary and oversteps what is known to be on the table.

""That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It’s time to change that momentum.""States use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered ""categorical aid"" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula.According to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: ""This categorical aid is the state’s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts.""Evers’ request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts’ special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019.""We’re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn’t been raised in over a decade,"" Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio ""Devil’s Advocates.""Is Evers right?The evidenceWhen asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters.According to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact.Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-’18 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, ""in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years.""So, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years:2008-’09 -- $381,741,7002009-’10 -- $388,003,3202010-’11-- $400,250,7552011-’12 -- $408,533,7442012-’13 -- $414,517,7812013-’14 -- $421,242,0382014-’15 -- $421,742,0432015-’16 -- $427,062,3732016-’17 -- $436,160,315Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021At the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007:2007-2008 -- 124,5202008-2009 -- 123,7342009-2010 -- 123,4122010-2011 -- 122,7632011-2012 -- 121,8812012-2013 -- 121,3782013-2014 -- 120,6982014-2015 -- 118,6012015-2016 -- 118,9232016 -2017 -- 118,209That represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-’08 to 2016-’17. The enrollment counts for 2018-’19 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease.So, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation.According to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-’09 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil.In 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil.So, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140.A DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and ""those ride on top of regular education costs.""The Walker teamWhen asked about Evers’ claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students:In the last budget, the governor approved DPI’s request for Special Education Transitions Incentive Grants ($6.1 million). This program provides payment to school districts based on postsecondary education and employment for pupils with disability. The definition of postsecondary is a reference to any education beyond high school.Project SEARCH, a business-led collaboration that helps young people with disabilities gain and maintain employment through hands-on training and in-field career exploration. Project SEARCH is a national program developed in Cincinnati in 1996 and has grown to include programs in 42 states. In 2014, Walker signed legislation for a $35.4 million expansion to the Wisconsin Fast Forward worker training program, which included $850,000 to expand Project SEARCH sites in the state from seven to 27 over three years.Walker approved Special Education Transitions Readiness Investment Grants ($1.5 million). These grants fund transportation for special needs students to internships or work, training for school staff, and additional staff to support coordinating work experiences for special needs students with local businesses and organizations.Walker proclaimed 2014 as a Year of a Better Bottom Line to promote the employment of people with disabilities.Altenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here.Our ratingEvers said ""special education categorical aid"" from the state ""hasn’t been raised in over a decade.""The Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million.Data shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018.

Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system.""Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes),"" Trump said. ""And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed.""""And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm,"" Trump said. ""And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely.""Was the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair.First, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it.Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons.One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission.One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt.Featured Fact-checkStudents for Trumpstated on February 16, 2021 in a Tweet“Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 23, 2021Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed.Before the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma.But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months.""PREPA was in bankruptcy,"" Carmacho said. ""That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm.""The bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy.Unlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho.Our rulingTrump said ""Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money.

""In Augusta, Golden voted to let welfare recipients use your tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, even lottery tickets.""The ad comes from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC focused on strengthening and maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Golden, a state representative, is looking to unseat two-term incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in November.Golden claims the ad was is false. Let’s find out.The claim’s originsThe super PAC’s claim refers to a state law passed in 2016 that limits people on Maine Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from using Electronic Benefits Transfer cards to purchase a laundry list of items, including tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets.This state law passed Maine’s House of Representatives 206-38 with bipartisan support.Golden was one of the 38 representatives who voted against the bill. He told the Sun Journal he opposes misuse of welfare funds, but the state-level restrictions were unnecessary because federal rules already prohibit using welfare money for items like tattoos, tobacco and alcohol.Golden spokesman Bobby Reynolds said just because Golden voted against that bill, it doesn’t mean he voted in favor of using welfare dollars for controversial purchases.Reynolds said that if the bill failed, Mainers would still be barred from using TANF funds to purchase those items under federal rules.""It was a solution in search of a problem,"" Reynolds said. ""To be clear, Jared Golden opposes the use of SNAP and TANF for such purchases.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021However, it’s worth noting that Maine’s 2016 law is more restrictive than federal law.The federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires states to maintain policies and practices to keep EBT cards from being used at liquor stores, casinos or adult-oriented entertainment establishments.The federal law does not restrict transactions at grocery stores that sell alcohol or that have ""gaming activities."" It also does not regulate how cash that has been withdrawn with an EBT card can be used. Maine's 2016 law also does not address cash withdrawals.""It would be virtually impossible to effectively monitor and implement such a restriction,"" Schott said.The 2012 federal law also does not mention tattoos or tobacco.Maine’s 2016 law expanded TANF EBT card purchase restrictions to also include tobacco products lotteries, bail, firearms, ammunition, vacation or travel services, tattoos and obscene materials or entertainment.The Poliquin campaign declined our request to comment on the content of the ad, saying the campaign had no control over the ad and no role in its creation.Our rulingThe Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Golden voted in favor of welfare recipients using tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets.Golden voted against a 2016 bill that limited EBT card purchases, saying federal law already covered the issue. Golden did not vote in favor of a measure that would expand EBT card use to those items.The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression.

The district, north of Austin, sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties.Hegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. ""We’ll show him tough,"" Hegar says in the video. ""Then we’ll show him the door.""Hegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's ""Capital Tonight:"" ""He hasn’t had a town hall in five years and he’s kind of acting as if he wants to retire.""Hegar points to news storiesWe sought Hegar’s factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as ""an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members."" The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn’t have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: ""Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on.""Christian Walker of Hegar’s campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions.Walker also singled out a February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter’s staff had told her and others that Carter hadn’t hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: ""I wouldn’t say that is ‘the’ reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can’t reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall.""One alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: ""Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting — essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question — with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos.""Carter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018, news story in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y.

""I’ve been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I’m way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category,"" Carter said.When we inquired into Carter’s formal schedule, we heard back from his office’s Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled ""Town Hall"" stating that Carter ""took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience.""We asked if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents.Taylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. ""The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents,"" Taylor wrote.Also, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live ""town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they’re unable to tune in during the live event."" She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018.

It’s also misleading to suggest that there was a hack, which implies an outsider broke into the data. However, there was a security breach.

The law also contained privacy provisions.We found examples dating back to 2010 of supporters and opponents commenting on the data collection. In an article in Bank Technology News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., praised the idea of essential ""real-time data collection"" so that the bureau could be an ""effective cop."" An editorial in the Orange County Register quoted an expert who raised concerns about the bureau’s plans to collect data on consumers transactions.A federal Government Accountability Report in 2014 discussed in detail how the bureau collected data from financial institutions and financial aggregators.Jeff Sovern, who teaches consumer protection law at St. John’s University, said it would be hard to collect information about the functioning of consumer financial markets without seeing information about credit cards and mortgages.""The bureau was established in part to keep the mortgage lending that led to the Great Recession from happening again, after all,"" he said.The ad contained no citations for its point, although association spokesman Jon Thompson sent us news articles pertaining to both. Thompson pointed to Cordray’s testimony Jan. 28, 2014, before a House committee.U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., asked Cordray: ""Would you object to getting permission from consumers, those people who you work for, before you collect and monitor their information?""Cordray said if the bureau had to get individuals’ permission before it sought aggregate data about the credit card market, that  ""would have the purpose of completely making it impossible for the agency to have any kind of data to know what's going on in these markets.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 21, 2021 in a postFacebook users can avoid “problems with your Facebook going against community standards” by changing your settings.By Daniel Funke • February 24, 2021Todd J. Zywicki, a George Mason University law professor and critic of the bureau under Cordray, said that most Americans don’t know that their private information is transmitted from banks to the government.""In that sense, ‘secret’ seems like an accurate term to me,"" he said.(News reports said that the Trump administration considered Zywicki to take over the bureau.)'Hack' at consumer protection bureauAs for the claim that the information was hacked, the RGA pointed to Mulvaney’s response to a question during an April 12, 2018, Senate committee if the data had been hacked.Mulvaney replied: ""I want to be careful about what I say and I'll be happy to talk about this more in private, but we have been able to document about 240 lapses in our data security.""Mulvaney said an additional 800 lapses were suspected but hadn’t been confirmed.Mulvaney provided similar information in January in a letter to Warren stating that before his tenure there were 233 confirmed breaches of personally identifiable information within the bureau’s consumer response system by the bureau or contractors. To put that number in context, the consumer bureau has handled more than one million complaints.(A spokesman for the bureau provided PolitiFact with the letter sent to Warren but declined to answer questions.)Mulvaney told senators he instituted a data collection freeze and had hired an outside party to test the integrity of the system.On May 31, Mulvaney told his staff in an email that ""after an exhaustive review by outside experts, including a comprehensive ‘white-hat hacking’ effort, we can lift that hold. The independent review concluded that ‘externally facing bureau systems appear to be well-secured.’""Zywicki said that the use of the term ""hack"" in the ad is not correct.""There have been hundreds of compromises of consumer information, but mainly they have been by inadvertently disclosing personally identifiable information by the contractors who collect the information that gets dumped into the consumer complaint database,"" he said.Our rulingA Republican Governors Association ad said that Richard Cordray ""secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times.""It’s misleading to state that the data was collected in secret when the law that established that the bureau could collect data to protect consumers. If some consumers didn’t realize the data would be collected, that doesn’t mean it was a secret.The use of the word ""hack"" is the wrong term -- it implies some nefarious person hacked into the data, and that’s not the case. There were breaches of personal information by the bureau or contractors.We rate this claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f7dd9c68-0ce8-4122-9a48-292aa260c71c","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pppWinN4D8,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/422/create-new-financial-regulations/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/richard-cordray/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mike-dewine/,https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4173/text,https://www.ocregister.com/2010/05/11/editorial-the-next-2000-page-bill/,https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/666000.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/24/facebook-posts/dont-waste-your-time-you-cant-block-facebooks-comm/,https://www.cyberscoop.com/mick-mulvaney-cfpb-data-breach/,https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.01.18%20MM%20to%20Warren_Data%20Collection.pdf,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/,https://www.cyberscoop.com/cfpb-collecting-consumer-data-resumes/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f7dd9c68-0ce8-4122-9a48-292aa260c71c",,"Ohio,Technology,Republican Governors Association",,,,,

This is not America. It is not the America I came to 35 years ago.""We didn’t divine how to pin trends in insults. But, we found, the FBI and others tabulate anti-Muslim attacks and hate crimes.Have records recently been set? By phone, Rachid told us he based his declaration on accounts of upticks tied to FBI figures; he emailed us web links to news stories and a commentary published in 2017 and 2018.Included was a November 2017 Pew Research Center blog post citing FBI figures indicating 307 incidents of U.S. anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2016, which marked a 19 percent increase from 2015.Pew’s post specifies that a record was set in 2016 in the subcategory of anti-Muslim assaults, which rose significantly between 2015 and 2016, per the FBI, easily surpassing the previous peak reached in 2001, the year of the 9/11 attacks. For 2016, the FBI reported 127 reported Muslim victims of aggravated or simple assault, compared with 91 the year before and 93 in 2001, Pew's post says.SOURCE: Blog post, ""Assaults against Muslims in U.S. surpass 2001 level,"" Fact Tank, Pew Research Center, Nov. 15, 2017 (accessed July 31, 2018)""But assaults are not the only form of hate crime carried out against Muslims and other religious groups,"" Pew’s post says. ""The most common is intimidation, which is defined as reasonable fear of bodily harm. Anti-Muslim intimidation also increased in 2016, with 144 reported victims, compared with 120 the previous year."" Pew cautioned, though, that the 2016 ""intimidation"" count was ""dwarfed by the 296 victims of anti-Muslim intimidation in 2001"" tallied by the FBI.A general caution: Pew and others that explore anti-Muslim activism stress that the FBI collects hate crime data from about 15,000 law enforcement agencies that voluntarily participate, which means the statistics likely undercount hate crimes.FBI reports on anti-Muslim incidentsNext, we looked directly at the FBI’s annual reports on hate crimes, which the agency defines as ""criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against"" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation.It looked to us like the greatest percentage spike in reported anti-Islamic incidents occurred between 2000 and 2001. For the latter year, the FBI tallied 481 anti-Islamic incidents--a count up more than 1,600 percent from 28 in 2000. According to the FBI, such incidents decreased by 68 percent to 155 the next year and then dipped to 149 in 2003 before escalating to 156 in 2004.We also reviewed the agency’s recent tallies, finding there was not a bigger-than-post-9/11 spike in incidents in recent years -- though the numbers have been on the rise. The 307 incidents noted for 2016 compare to 257 reported incidents in 2015, the FBI says, and that count was up 67 percent from 154 anti-Muslim incidents reported in 2014.Put another way, the 2016 tally reflected a two-year 99 percent increase. But that latest count still fell 36 percent shy of the agency’s 2001 count of 481 anti-Muslim incidents.A California researcherFeatured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Rachid offered among the stories fueling his claim a July 2017 analysis of hate crimes against U.S. Muslims by Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Levin’s article, covering every year since 9/11, says that from 2002 to 2014, the FBI’s counts of anti-Muslim crimes receded to a range of 105 to 160 though the 257 tally for 2015 was the highest since 2001 and, the article says, the second-highest total of anti-Muslim hate crimes since the agency began eliciting reports of hate crimes from police agencies in 1992.Not only did anti-Muslim crime cases rise numerically, the article says, they grew as a percentage of all hate crimes, accounting in 2015 for 4.4 percent of all reported hate crimes even though Muslims are estimated to be only 1 percent of the population, the article says.By phone, Levin told us that in 2016, per FBI figures, anti-Muslim hate crimes accounted for 5 percent of all hate crimes. After 9/11, Levin told us, anti-Muslim hate crimes represented 4.5 percent of hate crimes reported by the agency.In 2016, Levin’s published calculations of hate crimes against Muslims were cited by Hillary Clinton to justify her claim that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques had tripled after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Levin said in a 2016 interview that since 9/11, anti-Muslim incidents ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes. PolitiFact rated Clinton’s claim Mostly True.Civil rights reports by CAIRHoping for more up-to-date information, we approached several non-government groups about research into anti-Muslim incidents. This tack drew data only from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which says it challenges stereotypes of Islam and Muslims.Zainab Arain of CAIR pointed by email to the council’s latest annual civil rights report. The April 2018 report, based on investigations by council staff, says that in 2017, there were 2,599 U.S. anti-Muslim ""bias incidents,"" including 300 hate crimes--a count exceeding the council’s confirmation of 2,213 incidents in 2016 by 17 percent.The report classifies incidents by type. Harassment, it says, accounted for 14 percent of the confirmed incidents in 2017 with incidents in which an individual was ""inappropriately targeted and harassed by Customs and Border Protection"" proving second-most prevalent. Anti-Muslim hate crimes, including crimes targeting children and families, made up 12 percent of the 2017 cases, the report says, with incidents involving FBI harassment or other targeting of individuals constituting 10 percent of incidents. SOURCE: Web page, ""2018 Civil Rights Report: Bias Incident Data,"" Council on American-Islamic Relations, April 30, 2018 (fetched Aug. 1, 2018)Its counts, the report says, should be considered only a ""snapshot of the experiences of American Muslims, including children, youth, and families. From experience, CAIR knows that bias incidents targeting the community are vastly underreported to both law enforcement and community institutions. Community members will often not report incidents, such as harassment and bullying, because of a certain level of desensitization,"" the report says.Arain told us: ""Based on the numbers we report, we have documented more anti-Muslim bias incidents and anti-Muslim hate crimes from 2015 to present than were documented in the year immediately following September 11, 2001.""We followed up by checking the council’s 2002 civil rights report. It says the group received 1,516 complaints from community members over the year involving the lives of more than 2,250 people, most of whom ""were subjected to incidents of bias-motivated harassment and violence"" including several murders, the report says. The report says its complaint count was up 300 percent from the year before. ""Excluding the September 11 backlash incidents,"" the report says, ""this year's normal reporting period contains 525 valid complaints, up from 366 in 2000/2001--a 43 percent increase.""Our rulingRachid said: ""Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11.""Incidents confirmed by the pro-Muslim CAIR support this statement. Also, FBI hate-crime statistics drawn from police departments indicate there were more anti-Muslim assaults in 2016 than after 9/11 though its counts generally indicate there were more anti-Muslim incidents after 9/11.

Bill Nelson said the Trump administration reached a new low by charging detained immigrant parents high fees to call the children they were separated from at the border.""The Trump administration has been charging detained parents, get this, as much as $8 a minute to call their children,"" Nelson, of Florida, said July 23 on the Senate floor. ""And the children were separated from the parents because the administration separated them; $8 a minute if you want to talk to your child. That is a new low.""Nelson faces a tough re-election challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott.More than 2,300 children were separated from the adults they were traveling with as a result of President Donald Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy, which directed the prosecution of all immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally. As adults were referred for prosecution, children traveling with them were placed into the custody.The Trump administration has reunified more than 1,000 children with their parents. But not all can be easily reunified, in part because some parents have already been deported. Overall, exact government figures on separations and reunifications have been inconsistent and limited.We wondered about Nelson’s claim that parents in detention were being charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children. Nelson’s office pointed to media reports saying parents had to pay for phone calls. But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rebuked those claims.Some advocates for immigrants said they couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute claim, or had heard lower rates.Nelson’s evidenceAbout 150 lawmakers, including Nelson, sent a letter July 20 to ICE’s acting director, Ronald D. Vitiello, expressing concerns over ""apparent misinterpretation"" of ICE’s telephone access policies.""Reports and first-hand accounts have indicated that many of these detained parents have been forced to endure weeks without any information as to the location of their children,"" the letter said. ""Once their children are finally located, moreover, reports indicate that their parents are forced to pay as much as $8 per minute to speak with them by telephone, and that their access to this service can be limited to as little as one call per week.""The letter cites a June 21 NPR interview of Jenny Hixon, outreach director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Hixon told NPR that some parents at a detention center in Pearsall, Texas, ""had not been able to speak to their children yet because in order to be able to speak to their children, they needed to pay $25 to get a commissary account. And then the phone calls are about $8 a minute.""PolitiFact emailed Hixon for more information but received an automated message saying she was no longer employed by the legal services group. We asked the group’s communications director to confirm the figure, but did not receive the confirmation by deadline.Nelson’s office also referred us to a July 3 article from the Texas Tribune reporting that immigrants in detention faced ""usurious phone rates and bureaucratic hassles to contact their family members."" The story said advocates were worried that ""the cost and complexity of using detention facility phones could hamper family reunification efforts that have already been plagued by chaos and confusion.""But the Texas Tribune story didn’t cite an $8 a minute rate. It said the cost ""can top 20 cents per minute and has been criticized as exorbitant.""The story mentioned comments made in a June 22 court filing by a mother detained in Texas who was separated from her children. ""The calls are very expensive so I am only able to call when I have money, but when I do not have money, I am not able to communicate with my children. In one month I only received one free call from the center,"" the woman said.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021The story added: ""Lawyers and advocates working with immigrants detained since the ‘zero tolerance’ policy went into effect say costs and procedures vary from facility to facility, but they have heard that charges range from 10 to 25 cents per minute for domestic calls."" It did not say if those calls were made to children.Trump administration denies charging parents to call their childrenICE spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea told PolitiFact calls are facilitated ""at no charge"" to detained parents whether their children are in HHS custody or with sponsors.But Buzzfeed, in a July 23 story about the lawmakers’ letter, reported that ""when asked about reports detailing high, per-minute fees for phone calls to children,"" a different spokeswoman ""agreed it was ‘possible’ that occurred when parents were trying to call children who were no longer in federal custody.""Children in HHS custody don’t have 24-hour access to phones, but calls are being arranged at least twice a week, sometimes more frequently, Elzea told PolitiFact. In some cases, detained parents are able to talk to their children through video-conferencing, she said.ICE detention standards say detainees shall be able to make free calls to an ICE-provided list of free legal service providers, to consular officials and to certain government offices.""Indigent detainees, who are representing themselves pro se, shall be permitted free calls on an as-needed basis to family or other individuals assisting with the detainee’s immigration proceedings,"" standards say.HHS said that children in its shelters don’t pay for calls to their families or sponsors. The agency said it pays for those calls.Two legal services groups representing immigrant families were unable to confirm to PolitiFact if parents were charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children.Some parents detained at Port Isabel detention center in Texas told lawyers that they were charged about $3 a minute to call their children, said Megan McKenna, spokeswoman for Kids in Need of Defense. The group represents unaccompanied immigrant and refugee children in deportation proceedings.""It’s possible that there was a free call number, but the detainees our team spoke to did not know about it, if there was,"" McKenna said.Efren Olivares, a program director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said he couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute figure. But when detainees at the Port Isabel detention center call Texas Civil Rights Project lawyers, they get a recording saying the call is 20 cents a minute, Olivares said.Our rulingNelson said detained immigrant parents separated from their children at the border are being charged ""as much as $8 a minute to call their children.""ICE told us that parents should not be charged to talk to their children. But lawyers working with parents have heard that they were charged. One legal services group told PolitiFact that there may be a free number to call, but its clients did not know about it and had been charged.Having said that, we were only able to find one instance of anyone claiming that parents had to pay as much as $8 per minute. Most of the accounts we found mentioned amounts ranging from $3 a minute to 20 cents a minute. There is some anecdotal evidence to back Nelson's claim, but not enough to establish that $8 a minute as standard practice.Nelson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

It's the same way Barack Obama did it,"" conservative commentator Matt Schlapp said during the June 15 broadcast of Fox News' America's Newsroom. ""This is the problem with all of these things, the outrage you see coming from the left. There wasn't outrage over Barack Obama separating kids from adults.""While the Obama administration's immigration approach was not without controversy, it’s simply untrue to say he had a policy of separating families.Trump policyLet’s recap what the Trump administration is doing, before turning to Obama’s handling of immigration.Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution.A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian.Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31 as a result of border-crossing prosecutions.Obama policyImmigration experts we spoke to said Obama-era policies did lead to some family separations, but only relatively rarely, and nowhere near the rate of the Trump administration. (A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated at the border.)""Obama generally refrained from prosecution in cases involving adults who crossed the border with their kids,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. ""In contrast, the current administration has chosen to prosecute adult border-crossers, even when they have kids. That's a choice — one fundamentally different from the choice made by both Obama and previous presidents of both parties.""Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said immigration attorneys ""occasionally"" saw separated families under the Obama administration.""However, these families were usually reunited quite quickly once identified,"" she said, ""even if that meant release of a parent from adult detention.""In Trump’s case, family separations are a feature, not a bug, of the administration’s border policies, said David Fitzgerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies.""The family separations are not the small-scale collateral consequences of a border policy, but rather, a deliberate initiative,"" he added.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Former Obama officials in recent interviews drew sharp distinctions between Trump’s policy and that of his predecessors.The Trump administration's current approach is modeled after Operation Streamline, a 2005 program under the administration of George W. Bush, according to Obama spokesman Eric Schultz. The key difference, he said, is that while the 2005 program referred all illegal immigrants for prosecution, it made exceptions for adults traveling with children.Jeh Johnson, Obama’s Homeland Security secretary from 2013 to the end of his presidency, said such separations occurred in rare cases, but never as a matter of policy.""I can't say that it never happened. There may have been some exigent situation, some emergency,"" Johnson told NPR June 9. ""There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child. I can't say it never happened — but not as a matter of policy or practice. It's not something that I could ask our Border Patrol or our immigration enforcement personnel to do.""Obama’s top domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, said the Obama administration briefly weighed the separation of parents from children, before deciding against it.""I do remember looking at each other like, ‘We’re not going to do this, are we?’ We spent five minutes thinking it through and concluded that it was a bad idea,"" she told the New York Times. ""The morality of it was clear — that’s not who we are.""Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said that, as a deterrent, the Obama administration began prosecuting border-crossers who had already been deported at least once.""But very few of those people crossed with children, so it didn’t become as visible an issue,"" he said. ""There was some child separation and some pushback by immigrant advocacy groups around that, but the numbers were quite limited.""The idea of prosecuting people who cross the border illegally the first time they are caught is entirely new,"" he added. ""So we haven’t seen children separated from their parents on anything near this scale before.""The Obama administration’s immigration policy was not without controversy, to be sure.In 2014, amid an influx of asylum seekers from Central America, the administration established large family detention centers to hold parents and children — potentially indefinitely — as a means of deterring other asylees. The practice eventually lost a legal challenge, resulting in a 2016 decision that stopped families from being detained together.Schlapp told us that his claim referred to the fact that both Obama and Trump are bound by the same procedures prohibiting family detention.However, Schlapp’s full comment gives the misleading impression that Trump is essentially continuing Obama’s policy, when in fact Trump’s zero tolerance policy is quite different.  Our rulingSchlapp said the Trump administration’s policy of separating families is ""the same way Barack Obama did it.""Obama’s immigration policy specifically sought to avoid breaking up families. While some children were separated from their parents under Obama, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a far lower rate than under Trump, where the practice flows from a zero tolerance approach to illegal border-crossings.We rate this False.

But one part of the letter that caught our eye is an assertion about how the White House responded to media disclosures of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and Russian nationals. This meeting, involving Trump's eldest son and first reported by the New York Times, has attracted intense interest from Mueller’s investigators, as well as from congressional committees.The lawyers’ memo acknowledged that President Trump had indeed dictated an initial statement to the New York Times. It went on to defend the president's message as ""short but accurate.""""You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr.,"" said the Jan. 29, 2018, letter from attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd.However, the original explanation for the meeting was not as accurate as the lawyers’ asserted.The statement from Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting focused ""primarily"" on Russian adoptions. But while the adoptions were indeed mentioned at the meeting, there is evidence that the broader topic of sanctions against well-connected Russians under the Magnitsky Act received significant attention.The statement also offered incomplete characterizations of how much Trump Jr. knew about meeting participants and what he expected to get out of it, and it ignored later efforts by the Russian side to follow up on the meeting.The White House did not respond to multiple inquiries for this article, and a separate inquiry to Sekulow was not returned.Trump Tower tick-tockAn email chain to coordinate the meeting shows that Donald Trump Jr. accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father’s campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The younger Trump forwarded the email chain to the candidate’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his campaign chair at the time. All three Trump campaign officials ended up attending the meeting on June 9, 2016.One of the participants was Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described in an email to Trump Jr. as a ""Russian government attorney."" Veselnitskaya has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official, according to the New York Times.Other participants included Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet soldier with experience in military counterintelligence, and Georgian-American Ike Kaveladze, who was once the subject of a congressional inquiry into Russian money-laundering through the U.S. banking system.The meeting became public knowledge after the New York Times reported on it 13 months later. For that article, Donald Trump Jr. gave the newspaper a statement (the one that is central to this fact-check):""It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.""That statement was later supplanted by other, conflicting statements from the Trump camp, including contradictions about whether Donald Trump himself dictated the statement in the name of his son — which his lawyers now say he did.The question of adoptionsThe most misleading part of the statement is that the meeting ""primarily"" entailed ""a program about the adoption of Russian children."" While that topic did come up in the meeting, the statement leaves out an apparently detailed discussion of the 2012 Magnitsky Act sanctions, as well as ""dirt"" on Bill Browder, the businessman who had pushed for the act.Veselnitskaya came to the meeting armed with talking points that were primarily critcisms of the Magnitsky Act that placed strong sanctions on prominent Russians and which Putin and his allies have worked hard to quash.Veselnitskaya’s five pages of talking points only mentioned ""adoptions"" in passing at the end, saying that the law ""became a basis for open confrontation between our countries, complicating relations on all key geopolitical issues and leading to the ban on Americans adopting Russian children.""Under questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee — transcripts of which have been released publicly — Trump Jr., Kaveladze and Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump who helped organize the meeting and attended it, said that adoptions were discussed at the meeting.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Trump Jr., for instance, testified that ""it started off with that sort of tax scheme (about the Democratic National Committee) and, you know, quickly migrated to Russian adoption and ultimately the Magnitsky Act.""The evidence suggests that the other topics took up a significant portion of the meeting.Kaveladze testified that Veselnitskaya offered remarks in the meeting ""about Magnitsky Act and about destructive role played by Bill Browder, the initiator of that act, in ruining relationship between U.S. and Russia. … She also suggested that the repeal of that act could significantly improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S.""At some point, Akhmetshin ""gave a little bit more details"" on this argument and segued into the act’s impact on adoptions, Kaveladze testified.Also in the meeting, Kaveladze added, Veselnitskaya talked at some length about the owners of Browder’s company being major Democratic donors and how that could be ""a negative for the Democratic Party.""This account is supported by a page of notes taken by Manafort and released by the committee. The document includes 11 bullet points, including ""Bill Browder,"" ""Offshore - Cyprus,"" ""Active sponsors of RNC,"" and, only as the final bullet point, ""Russian adoption by American families.""""If it’s what you say I love it""It’s also worth mentioning that adoptions were hardly the meeting’s draw for the Trump camp, according to emails Trump Jr. released three days after the initial New York Times story.The meeting was set in motion on June 3, 2016, when Trump Jr. received an email from Goldstone. He informed the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and told of his connection to a Russian government official with incriminating evidence against Clinton.""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone told Trump Jr.The younger Trump replied: ""If it’s what you say I love it.""Other points of contextSeveral other elements of the statement paint an incomplete picture. One is the question of whether there was follow-up after the meeting.That may be true for actions by the Trump side. Trump Jr. has said that he ""never discussed the meeting again"" with Goldstone or fellow meeting organizer Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. He also told Fox News’ Hannity that Goldstone apologized about the likely ""bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about.""However, there is evidence that the other side tried to reach out to the Trump campaign on more than one occasion. For instance, congressional investigators obtained an email from Goldstone to Trump aide Dan Scavino that ""encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that ‘Don and Paul’ were on board with the idea,"" a reference to Trump Jr. and Manafort, CNN reported in December 2017.In addition, there were attempts at outreach after the election, CNN reported in April 2018.Goldstone told congressional investigators that he proposed a second meeting with Veselnitskaya, the New York Times reported. Goldstone sent an email on Nov. 28, 2016, to Trump's assistant, Rhona Graff, that said, ""Aras Agalarov has asked me to pass on this document in the hope it can be passed on to the appropriate team."" The email, which had an attachment about the Magnitsky Act, was forwarded to then-Trump adviser Steve Bannon with the notation, ""Not sure how to proceed, if at all,"" CNN reported. A meeting never took place.Another area where the statement tells only part of the story is its claim that Trump Jr. was not told a specific name in advance. While we found no evidence that he knew a name in advance, Trump Jr. possessed a fair amount of more general information, judging by the email chain with Goldstone that was made public.The first email in the chain said in part, ""Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.""Later in the email chain, Goldstone wrote, ""Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.""Our rulingThe White House legal document said that then-candidate Trump ""dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article"" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.The accuracy of the statement was misleading, at least.The statement's most inaccurate suggestion was that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoptions. That wasn't what the Trump officials came to hear about, and adoptions weren't atop the list of topics for the Russian figures, either.

Sherrod Brown’s first TV attack ad portrays his opponent U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci as a fan of lobbyists working in government.""The U.S. Congress. There’s 68 teachers, 15 farmers, four pilots but only one lobbyist,"" says the narrator as a cash register cha-ching sound is heard in the background. ""That's right, Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress. And what's he done? He voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest.""Text on the screen shows this is a reference to the 112th Congress. That timeframe refers to January 2011 to January 2013.Democrats have long portrayed Renacci as a lobbyist. But what this ad omits is that while he was registered to lobby, there is no evidence he actually lobbied. And in fact, it wouldn’t make sense for a member of Congress to work as a lobbyist at the same time. The ad also gives viewers no context about the votes cited.Brown is one of several Democratic incumbents defending a seat in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump endorsed Renacci during the primary.‘Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress’Before being elected to Congress, Renacci primarily worked in the private sector. He owned and operated over 60 entities, according to his Congressional biography, including nursing facilities, a CPA firm, real estate and auto dealerships. (He later said it was his experience losing his dealership in the auto industry bailout when General Motors closed his dealership that prompted him to run for Congress.)He also served as president on the Wadsworth City Council and then served as mayor from 2004 to 2008.In 2008, Renacci and two other individuals registered as lobbyists for Smokehouse International Group LTD, named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices. They intended to lobby in areas including defense, aviation, homeland security, and trade, according to their Senate lobbyist registration forms. Renacci filed documents with the House a handful of times between 2008 and 2011 stating that he gave no political contributions while a lobbyist. His campaign spokesman, James Slepian, said that it was a mistake to file the forms since he wasn’t lobbying and that it was handled by a lawyer.Slepian told us previously that two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm ""never got off the ground,"" Slepian said, ""but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients.""Brown’s campaign pointed to his lobbyist registration and a March article by the Associated Press.The AP quoted Renacci’s attorney, Laura Mills, as stating that Renacci never lobbied. She said that he asked her office to deactivate his lobbyist registration in 2009 before he entered Congress.But the AP found that Mills didn't file the companion form required to deactivate Renacci's registration until 2011, a few months after he took office.Members of Congress can’t lobby Congress or the executive branch on behalf of any private organization or individual ""as that would conflict with a Member‘s general obligation to the public,"" according to the House Ethics manual.In addition to it being banned, it defies logic that as a House member Renacci would want to lobby himself and his colleagues as a lobbyist. As a member, he already had the power to draft legislation and seek support from other members for his priorities.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021Renacci ‘voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest’This part of the ad references two votes by Renacci. The first one is fairly circuitous.The campaign pointed to Renacci’s vote on a procedural maneuver related to HR 921 on Nov. 16, 2016. The resolution related to a bill to ban U.S. bank transactions in connection with export of commercial aircraft to Iran. The resolution passed, with all of the Republicans voting in favor and all of the Democrats voting against it.If the resolution had been defeated, then the minority party — the Democrats — would have had the opportunity to decide what legislation to consider next.On the Democrats’ plate: the No Lobbyists on Presidential Transition Teams Act, HR 6324.That bill, introduced by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., would have prohibited the use of funds to the president-elect ""for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists."" The bill was in response to a move by Trump to put lobbyists in his transition team.The ad doesn’t explain that Renacci never took a direct vote on lobbyist bill -- in fact, it never received any vote.Joshua Huder, a senior fellow in the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown, said that the Brown ad is relying on a hypothetical scenario about a tenuous connection. Members in the majority rarely vote ""no"" on a previous question because that would be handing off power to the minority. That’s something that leadership strongly discourages.The ad also cited Renacci’s vote in favor of a change to House Ethics Rules on Jan. 6, 2015. The vote passed along partisan lines: All of the Democrats voted against it, while all but four Republicans voted for it.The new rules proposed by Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., said that a person who is a subject to a preliminary or second-phase review by the Office of Congressional Ethics shall be informed of the right to counsel and that the person’s constitutional rights can’t be denied.Slepian said that Renacci ""believes in due process as enshrined in our Constitution and this measure was brought forth to ensure that due process rights are not eroded by bodies within our government.""  The rule change drew objections in 2015 from Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. At the time, he felt the rules would inhibit the ethics committee’s investigations.But now that more three years have passed, Holman told PolitiFact that the House rules didn’t ""seem to have made much of a difference.""Our rulingBrown’s TV ad said, ""Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress"" and ""voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest.""Renacci misfiled paperwork about his lobbying activities, but there’s no convincing evidence he actually worked as a lobbyist while a member of Congress.The statement about a vote to help lobbyists hold government positions was not a direct vote. The ad is using circuitous logic on this point.Another vote involved a rule change that drew concerns from a government watchdog at the time, but the watchdog told PolitiFact that it ultimately didn’t make much difference.The statement omits critical evidence that would give a different impression.

Is he right?""Recently"" claim a stretchMitchell, the president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, is part of a large Democratic field seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He is making his second run for statewide office, having lost a 2012 bid for lieutenant governor to Rebecca Kleefisch.The laws he references created additional benefits for Wisconsin firefighters or their families in two specific scenarios.2009 Wisconsin Act 284 established a presumption that firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders who are killed or disabled by an infectious disease contracted the disease through their employment, giving them access to related benefits.2009 Wisconsin Act 285 required municipalities to pay health insurance premiums for the surviving spouses and dependent children of firefighters who die in the line of duty if they were paying premiums for the firefighter.You’ll notice the year built into the titles of the laws isn’t exactly, well, recent.The laws both were drafted in 2009 and took effect in May 2010.Was Mitchell a key force behind laws?Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Mitchell’s ""instrumental"" claim is a bit subjective, but leaning on the dictionary definition we’ll take that to mean Mitchell is claiming a key role in getting the laws passed.A lot goes into making a bill into a law — cue Schoolhouse Rock — but it seems fair to say a key person would be centrally involved with proposing the law, writing the law or pushing for its passage, through things like lobbying or testifying on behalf of the bill.Mitchell was a member of the union’s board when the laws were passed, in charge of outreach and public relations, according to his campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Allen. She said Mitchell attended committee hearings and floor debates in support of the bill and arranged for other firefighters to do the same. And he was part of the group that organized the bill signing.But Mitchell did not testify on behalf of the bills — that was left to other union representatives.And he did not formally lobby for the bills, either, since he was not a registered lobbyist until February 2011.As to the how the laws came to be, drafting records for the health insurance bill show it was introduced by state Sen. David Hansen (D-Green Bay) after the widow of former Green Bay firefighter Arnie Wolff wrote to him about her family’s financial struggles. The bill was drafted by the Legislative Reference Bureau at Hansen’s request and modeled after similar legislation in Illinois.Drafting records for the infectious diseases bill don’t specify the origin of the idea (and Mitchell didn’t claim he proposed it), but show it was drafted by the reference bureau at the request of then-state Sen. Jim Sullivan (D-Wauwatosa) based on a bill in Virginia.The union president who preceded Mitchell, Mike Woodzicka, said the union worked with legislators on the language of the bills, so Mitchell and other board members would have been part of email exchanges on that topic.Jay Wadd, a spokesman for Hansen, said he assumes such a step would have been part of the process on their bill, though he doesn’t have specific records of it given the time that has passed.Our ratingMitchell claims he was recently ""instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state.""But it’s a stretch to say the action was recent, and that Mitchell’s role was instrumental.Mitchell’s union supported the bills, and he was involved with supporting them, but there’s no evidence the bills wouldn’t have become law without his involvement.We rate Mitchell’s claim Mostly False.

The group favors stricter immigration policies.The report has drawn criticism for some of its assumptions, such as a higher-than-usual estimate of immigrants in the country illegally (12.5 million, higher than the typically reported 11 million) and for excluding tax contributions made by U.S.-born children to parents here illegally.Overall, it’s difficult to determine a precise cost of illegal immigration due to lack of reliable data. Report did not focus on housing costsFAIR’s report said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year, and that immigrants who are here illegally contribute about $19 billion in taxes annually. That puts net costs at about $116 billion a year.Blankenship said illegal immigration must be stopped because it costs $130 billion a year to house, feed and give benefits to people who shouldn’t even be in the United States.But FAIR’s report did not include estimates for the cost of public housing benefits, citing a lack of reliable information.The group also noted most welfare programs are not available to immigrants in the country illegally. But the group factored in costs for programs that benefit children born in the United States to parents here illegally.Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized FAIR for calculating welfare used by U.S.-born children, but failing to add in their potential tax contributions once they start working.""Counting the benefits consumed but ignoring the tax revenue they pay (or will do so in the future) is one way FAIR gets such a negative result for this report,"" Nowrasteh wrote in a September 2017 post enumerating flaws in the report.FAIR estimated that the welfare of illegal immigration amounts to about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs).Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Experts' critiqueWe asked more experts about the validity of FAIR’s findings.Their estimate is reasonable, though the cost could be more or could be less, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels.Even though most immigrants living illegally in the United States come to work and pay billions in taxes, that does not make them a net fiscal benefit, Camarota said.Other experts said there were flaws. For one, the report’s bottom line included federal immigration enforcement costs.""It seems ridiculous to attribute the costs of border security to unauthorized immigrants. Would people prefer we had no border security so then the costs of unauthorized immigration would be lower?"" said Madeline Zavodny, an immigration expert and economics professor at the University of North Florida.Enforcement is aimed not only at reducing unauthorized immigration but also at reducing drug smuggling and trafficking, Zavodny said.Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said, ""They are doing things in a way to try to exaggerate what the possible cost could be.""FAIR also factored in about $3.5 billion for assumed Medicaid fraud. We’ve fact-checked several other claims about the cost of illegal immigration based on FAIR’s reports, with experts raising concerns about their methodology and assumptions.In 2016, we rated Mostly False a claim from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump when he claimed that illegal immigration cost the United States more than $113 billion a year, finding that he selected the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varied widely.Our rulingBlankenship said, ""We have to stop illegal immigration, costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country.""Immigrants in the country illegally generate costs for taxpayers, but it’s difficult to determine a precise figure largely because there isn’t reliable data. Blankenship’s claim is based on a 2017 FAIR report estimating illegal immigration cost about $135 billion a year.Experts picked apart many aspects of the report’s methodology. But relevant to Blankenship’s statement, the group’s estimate did not factor in housing costs.For all welfare costs brought on by illegal immigration, FAIR calculated about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs).Blankenship’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others.Giffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates ""who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic."" Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list.Two Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn’t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018.The PAC’s evidenceTo back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House:BillKey provisionHR 1217Reauthorize grants for improvements to the criminal history record systemHR 2216Prohibits sale of gun to person who is subject to restraining orderHR 3130Makes it crime to knowingly give/sell gun to person convicted of misdemeanor stalkingHR 1475Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021Prohibits giving false or misleading material information in connection with a firearm purchase or transferHR 1478Ends prohibition on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using federal funds to promote gun control Giffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- ""derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote.""But the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs.Now to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked.Ryan’s responseTo refute the attack, Ryan’s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House:MeasureKey provisionsHR 2646More beds for people with mental illness who need short-term hospitalizationHR 4909Grants to improve school security, including with metal detectors, and to fund training, threat assessments, school and police coordinationHR 38Let people with concealed carry license bring guns across state lines; strengthen National Instant Criminal Background Check System The first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence.The other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines.Ryan’s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun’s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law.But it’s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban.Our ratingGiffords PAC says: ""Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws.""The anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn’t get to a vote in the House. So, it’s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that’s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power.Also, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines.We rate the statement Mostly False.

Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!"" he tweeted on March 18.Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018Here, we’re going to take a closer look at Trump’s assertion that Mueller’s team has 13 ""hardened Democrats,"" some ""big"" supporters of Hillary Clinton, and no Republicans. (The White House did not respond to inquiry for this article.)How many Democrats and Republicans are on Mueller’s team?The Special Counsel’s office had made public the identities of 17 attorney staff members through March 21. Their backgrounds are summarized here.Through public records, we were able to independently confirm that at least 12 people on Mueller’s staff are registered Democrats.They ones we confirmed are Greg Andres, Rush Atkinson, Ryan Dickey, Michael Dreeben, Kyle Freeny, Andrew Goldstein, Adam Jed, Elizabeth Prelogar, James Quarles, Jeannie Rhee, Brandon Van Grack, and Andrew Weissmann.Another member of Mueller’s team -- Aaron Zelinsky -- has been reported to be a registered Democrat by both the Washington Post and the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller also reported that Zelinsky wrote, ""I’m a Democrat,"" in a Huffington Post column supporting same-sex marriage in November 2012.In the meantime, we were able to independently confirm that two other members of Mueller’s staff -- Scott Meisler and Aaron Zebley -- are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members, Zainab Ahmad and Brian M. Richardson. According to the Daily Caller, Ahmad ""appears to have registered as a Republican at the age of 18, but has since changed her registration status to unaffiliated.""We’ll also note that in the jurisdictions in which the Mueller lawyers live -- primarily the District of Columbia, Maryland and New York -- the Democrats are the dominant party, meaning that many races are effectively decided in Democratic primaries rather than in the general election. However, Trump’s assertion that there are no Republicans on the team is undercut by the fact that its leader is Mueller, who is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia.Mueller was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). The Daily Caller has also reported that Mueller has occasionally donated to Republicans in both statewide and national races.Fox News has referred to Mueller as the ""only known Republican"" on the team. It’s worth noting the importance of the word ""known,"" since other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities. The names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public, the Special Counsel’s office told PolitiFact.James D. Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer who runs a continuing legal education class on Watergate and its lessons, said that FBI agents in particular are likely helping gather evidence.Agents ""come in all political stripes, though most are not active politically,"" Robenalt said. ""FBI agents, as most law enforcement, tend to be conservative, law-and-order types, so my guess is most would tend to be Republicans or conservative Democrats or just plain Independents.""So Trump is using some sleight-of-hand to say that there are ""zero Republicans"" on Mueller’s team. The team is led by a registered Republican, and there may be other registered Republicans working with Mueller whose identities the public simply doesn’t know about.How many team members supported Clinton?Trump has a point here, too, but it’s worth keeping the scale of the donations in context.Two of the 13 publicly known Mueller staffers donated what might be characterized as ""big"" sums to Clinton’s 2016 campaign -- Quarles, with $2,700, and Rhee, with $5,400. During the 2016 campaign cycle, $2,700 was the maximum donation an individual could make to a campaign. Such a donation could be made twice -- once for the primary campaign and then again for the general election.A third member of the team, Weissmann, donated $2,300 to Clinton, but that was in 2007, when she was making her first presidential run. (The Daily Caller separately reported that he attended Clinton’s election-night party in 2016.)Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021Three other team members donated smaller amounts: $250 by Freeny and Prelogar, and $200 by Atkinson.Does Mueller’s team have ‘13 hardened Democrats""?How you define ""hardened"" is a judgment call. But if you measure by campaign donations, the point is overblown. Seven of the registered Democrats have no record of writing checks to federal candidates.Based on federal disclosure data, Quarles is easily the most generous donor on the team, giving in excess of $35,000 over the better part of two decades. Most of these donations went to Democratic candidates or entities, but it’s worth noting that Quarles also made two donations totaling $2,750 to Republicans -- former Virginia Gov. George Allen and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz. He was the only team member to give donations to federal Republican candidates.The second-most generous team member was Rhee, who gave $11,950 to Democrats in federal races. Weissman ranked third, with $6,600, followed by Andres and Goldstein, both of whom gave in the mid-$3,000 range.Freeny, Prelogar, Van Grack and Atkinson also gave money in federal races, with donations from $200 to $800.The Daily Caller found additional donations totaling a little less than $12,000 in state and local races by eight of the staff members. These donations were to Democrats.So the donor on the team who gave the most money is also the only one to donate to Republican candidates as well. Four other staff members gave between $3,000 and $12,000 over a span of several years, four more gave donations only in the hundreds of dollars, and seven more didn’t give any money at all in federal races.How much do these affiliations matter?Mueller’s team has the legal right to register to vote with a party or by making personal donations. Such activities are protected under the Hatch Act, originally passed in 1939.It’s also important to note that Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team.Both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act ""prohibit using political affiliation and may also prohibit using certain ideological affiliations in hiring and taking other personnel actions with regard to career attorneys,"" the department’s inspector general has written.Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship.Every federal employee swears an oath to ""support and defend the Constitution of the United States"" and ""bear true faith and allegiance to the same."" Lawyers practicing in the federal courts swear a separate oath ""that as an attorney and as a counselor of this court, I will conduct myself uprightly and according to law, and that I will support the Constitution of the United States.""Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in political law and government ethics at the firm Akerman LLP, said that in his experience, ""Justice Department lawyers tend to skew towards the Democrats while FBI agents are overwhelmingly Republican. Both of them take an oath to dispense justice without fear or favor with regard to political party, and I’ve never seen anyone from either group act in a partisan way.""""I don’t think one should ever ask about party affiliation when it comes to prosecutors,"" Robenalt added. ""They come in all stripes. The question is whether they are qualified — and as I understand it, the team assembled is highly qualified.""Robenalt said he wouldn’t advise young Justice Department lawyers to voluntarily eschew all political activity today for fear of getting attacked if they one day join a politically charged investigation.""It is a First Amendment right and crucial to our democracy,"" he said.

Matt Caldwell, R-North Fort Myers, appeared on CNN to explain why he and his colleagues voted not to consider a bill to ban assault-style weapons after the horrific high school shooting in Parkland, Fla.During the interview, Caldwell drew upon a favored talking point.""A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder,"" Caldwell said Feb. 21.The comment caught our ear and we were curious about the data behind it.We reached out to Caldwell and got no response. His source is most likely number-crunching by John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that has written about what it sees as the media’s anti-gun agenda, the need for parishioners to go to church armed, and similar themes.In 2015, Lott compared the rate of crimes committed by police nationwide to permit revocations in Texas, Florida and Michigan. The numbers on police crime came from a national search of news reports by a team at Bowling Green State University.Lott took the national data and compared it to the fraction of permit holders in Texas who had their permits revoked.Lott worked the data several ways and found a substantial gap.""The rate for police was between 7 to 10 times higher than for permit holders,"" Lott said.But Lott’s work contains one clear counting flaw.His data on crimes by police came from research by Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University. Stinson told PolitiFact that Lott failed to note that Stimson was reporting the number of cases, not the number of individual officers involved in crimes.""Some officers are arrested more than once, and some arrested officers have more than one arrest case because of multiple victims,"" Stinson said. ""So, the whole analysis is wrong because the rates are mangled by using a different unit of analysis.""Lott said he doubts that would make a sufficient difference.""The number of officers committing crimes could be higher or lower, but you’d have to have it be 7 to 10 times lower in order to reverse the ranking."" he said. ""That doesn’t seem very likely.""Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021There’s another counting issue.Two leading researchers questioned Lott’s use of permit revocations to measure crimes by permit holders.""Those data undercount the true number of infractions,"" said criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Think of the process: an infraction occurs, then it must be reported to the police or another legal authority, the police must find it as a crime or infraction that would warrant revocation, and then the revocation must occur.""Rosenfeld said instances fall out of the dataset at each step along the way.Lott agreed that national victimization surveys show that relatively small percentages of crimes get reported, even fewer result in an arrest, and a smaller fraction yet lead to conviction.""Revocations won’t capture the full number,"" he said. ""I don’t know how to compare that pattern to police crimes because there are no matching survey data for police.Lott said he believes that police would be less likely than the average permit holder to be caught in a crime, but that is more theory than proven trend.Law professor and statistical analyst John Donohue at Stanford University gave another reason to doubt the link between revocations and crime. In his research, he found a ""number of cases where the permit holder was killed while committing a crime and of course those permits are not revoked.""Donohue added that much research shows that when the number of police rises, crime goes down.Our rulingCaldwell said that a law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a concealed weapon permit holder. That is based on shaky numbers.The article behind Caldwell’s statement treated the number of criminal cases involving officers as if it were equal to the number of officers themselves. According to the researcher that looked at those crimes by police, that ""mangled"" the crime rates of officers. A single officer could be named in many cases.On the flip side of the ledger, other researchers said that using permit revocations undercounts the number of crimes by permit holders. The analyst behind the Caldwell’s statement agreed that it is an imperfect measure.In short, the statement rests on dicey numbers. Those numbers point to the need for more research, but they don’t prove anything.We rate this claim False.Update: After this item published, we heard from John Lott and added his comments.

168,,,,true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/feb/16/rebecca-dallet/supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallets-claim-she-/,"Says that as a judge, she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases.""",,politifact,,"Rebecca Dallet argues she is the most experienced candidate running in the Feb. 20, 2018, primary for Wisconsin Supreme Court.The liberal-leaning Milwaukee County circuit judge faces Madison attorney Tim Burns, a declared Democrat, and conservative Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. The two with the most votes will square off April 3 to replace conservative Justice Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election.Dallet, in answering questions from the Wisconsin Justice Initiative about her qualifications, said that as a judge she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases.""Her response, published online Jan. 19, 2018, essentially repeats a claim she has made a number of times, including in news releases and in interviews.""Presided over"" suggests significant involvement in a case and 10,000 is a big number.Let’s take a look.Dallet’s caseloadDallet was elected judge in 2008. As one of 47 Milwaukee County judges, she currently serves in the civil division, which handles cases such as lawsuits, small claims and restraining orders. She previously was assigned homicide, felony drug, felony sexual assault and felony gun cases; general misdemeanor and domestic violence cases, and other matters.We contacted the Milwaukee County circuit clerk’s office, which provided a spreadsheet of cases in which Dallet is listed as the ""responsible court official."" The spreadsheet shows 11,808 cases assigned to Dallet.The major categories break down this way:Type of caseNumber of casesPercentage of casesTraffic2,93924.9%Misdemeanor2,59121.9%CivilFeatured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 20212,57621.8%Felony2,29219.4% But there are some points worth noting.Amy Wochos, a senior administrator with the court clerk’s office, told us the list probably both overcounts and undercounts Dallet’s cases.For example, the list does not include cases where Dallet conducted some hearings, but then the case was transferred to another judge to conduct the remaining hearings. And the list includes cases in which another judge conducted all the hearings in a case, but then the case was technically transferred to Dallet before it was officially closed in the court system.An example of the latter:In the first case on Dallet’s list, a West Allis man was charged in 2008 with drug possession. The court record shows he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The man’s initial court appearance and some other matters were handled by Circuit Court commissioners; an indigency hearing and a status conference were held by one Circuit Court judge and the sentencing was handled by another judge. For all practical purposes, the case was complete, but it was transferred to Dallet prior to a formal judgment of conviction being entered into the record.It’s worth noting that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through a plea bargain, not by a trial. But trials can lead to lengthy proceedings.An example:In December 2008, a Milwaukee man was charged with second offense possession of marijuana, a felony, and misdemeanor bail jumping. Court commissioners handled the initial steps, including a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to put the man on trial. Starting in January 2009, Dallet handled the case the rest of the way, for a total of about six months. In-court proceedings included a motion hearing, a scheduling conference, a pretrial conference and several other hearings leading up to a two-day jury trial. The man was found guilty and was sentenced by Dallet on March 30, 2009. The case came before Dallet again three months later, when she had to rule on a request from the man regarding his sentencing.Before we wrap up, one more example:The first civil case on Dallet’s list was a foreclosure filed in March 2010. It remained on the court docket for more than seven years, until November 2017, though it was before Dallet only briefly. The case was transferred to her in March 2016 and she later issued two orders in the case.In sum, some cases handled by a judge can involve numerous actions and proceedings over a period of months, while others require less activity. And it’s important to note that in-court proceedings don’t take into account any research or other preparation a judge has to do outside of court.Like criminal cases, Dallet may have spent relatively little time on some civil cases and much more time on others.Our ratingDallet says that as a judge, she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases.""The best-available count shows Dallet has handled some 11,800 cases, including criminal and civil matters.For a statement that is accurate, without any significant information missing, our rating is True.  div class='artembed'> Share the Facts 2018-02-16 16:46:10 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says that as a judge, she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases.""

Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?""",,politifact,,"President Donald Trump’s visit to the Sheffer Corp. near Cincinnati was billed as a chance to discuss the recently enacted tax law. While Trump did discuss the tax law, most coverage of the speech led with a digression in which Trump accused Democrats of treason.It came as Trump was touting a drop in African-American unemployment, as he had done on several occasions previously. He knocked Democrats for their failure to applaud when he mentioned this during his State of the Union address.""You’re up there, you’ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild — they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country,"" Trump said on Feb. 5. ""And you have the other side, even on positive news — really positive news, like that — they were like death and un-American.  Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.""There’s actually a very good reason why not: The Constitution.""It was a profoundly stupid and ignorant statement,"" said Carlton F.W. Larson, a law professor at the the University of California-Davis who is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. ""There are occasional hard cases where it is debatable whether something constitutes treason. But this is not one of them.""The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NBC News the following day that Trump had been ""tongue in cheek,"" and in the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, ""The president was clearly joking with his comments.""Still, we’ve decided to fact-check Trump’s statement for two reasons. First, the long lead-up to the ""treason"" comment came off as entirely serious, and while the reference to ""treason"" itself was uttered in a flip manner, it fell short of being clearly a joke. (Watch the video and judge for yourself here.)Second, the Constitution is very clear when it comes to the definition of treason.The Constitution -- which mentions very few crimes specifically -- defines treason this way:""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.""The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.""This is a narrow definition. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government.With the possible exception of an American ""levying war"" against U.S. troops in a place like Afghanistan, ""the biggest-picture takeaway is that there is no treason occurring on any side now,"" said Jed Shugerman, a legal historian at Fordham Law School.Indeed, Shugerman has previously cautioned those on the left who would label members of Trump’s circle as treasonous for allegedly cooperating with Russia during the 2016 election. The most fundamental reason why the word ""treason"" would be inaccurate in such cases, Shugerman and others argue, is that the United States is not at war with Russia.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021""We are not at war with Russia under any fair understanding of the word,"" he said. Shugerman added that even a notion like ""cyberwar"" with Russia is a metaphor for war rather than an actual deadly conflict, unless that cyberwar were to escalate to, say, hacking into nuclear power plants with the intent of exploding them.Calling U.S.-Russia relations ""war"" is no more accurate than calling the Super Bowl ""war"" just because the players talk about battle plans and how to attack their enemy, he said.Because the definition of treason is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country’s history, and none, apparently, since the end of World War II, which -- perhaps not coincidentally -- was the last officially declared war.A rendering of the Whiskey Rebellion. (Wikimedia commons)Charges of treason have been prosecuted in relation to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; against Aaron Burr (who was acquitted); Thomas W. Dorr, who set up a parallel government of Rhode Island in the 1840s (he was convicted but later pardoned); and a number of cases related to slavery and the Civil War.There was a flurry of treason cases during and after World War II, including the poet Ezra Pound for pro-Axis propaganda (he was hospitalized for insanity) and the broadcast propagandists known as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally (both of whom served prison time).The rarity of treason charges can also be seen in the examples of actions that never drew a treason charge.When Eugene V. Debs was prosecuted for encouraging draft avoidance during World War I, he was charged with sedition, not treason. During the Cold War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage charges, not treason. (Espionage does not have to occur during wartime, or even against an enemy.) And Jane Fonda was never charged with treason for allegations of anti-Americanism when she consorted with the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.Legal scholars we contacted unanimously said Trump’s words were ill-conceived.""It’s not only legally frivolous and offensive to suggest that an act of political protest as simple as not clapping isn’t treason, but it’s wholly ignorant of why the Constitution has a treason clause in the first place — to prevent what was a common practice in England at the time, in which the government labeled its political opponents as ‘traitors’ and used that as an excuse to throw them in jail,"" said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.""Being rude and partisan does not come close to the constitutional definition of treason,"" agreed Robert F. Turner, a fellow at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia.Michael C.H. McDaniel, the director of Homeland Security Law Programs at Western Michigan University, said there could hardly be a clearer example of protected political speech than the one Trump decided to label treasonous.""Expressing partisan disagreement with the president is not treason -- in fact, it is political speech, the core speech to which the First Amendment is protecting from the Federal government,"" he said.Our rulingTrump said that at the State of the Union address, Democrats, ""even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason?

Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013.An immigrant would first have to become a naturalized citizen — an option available after being a permanent resident for at least five years. As a naturalized citizen, an immigrant can petition for siblings, and the siblings could bring in their spouses and unmarried children.But there are limits on the number of visas issued per year per family category.More than 3.9 million people were in line for a visa as of Nov. 1, 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a ""fourth-preference"" category, which had 2.3 million people waiting for a visa — the wait period is over 13 years for immigrants from most nations, but even longer for some countries with heavy demand, such as Mexico and the Philippines.Siblings in the Philippines would have to wait at least 23 years for a visa, and Mexican siblings at least 20 years.""As a practical matter, because of these long backlogs there is not as much chain migration as President Trump claims,"" said Stephen W.

The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why ""chain migration"" and a visa lottery program should end.""This man that came in — or whatever you want to call him — brought in, with him, other people … He was the point of contact — the primary point of contact for — and this is preliminarily — 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that’s not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we’ve wanted to do that for a long time,"" Trump said Nov. 1.Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: ""So the lottery has to end, chain migration — he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why?""Two days earlier during a meeting on immigration with bipartisan lawmakers, Trump said it was ""22 to 24 people came in through him.""We wondered if Trump was right: have at least 22 people come to the United States due to familial links to Saipov?Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security provided information to substantiate Trump’s claims. A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases.Experts told us Trump’s figures are improbable.Green card holders have limits on family sponsorshipSaipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States.Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old.That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J.""Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false,"" said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013.Once in the United States, green card holders, such as Saipov, are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021We have not seen any reports of 29-year-old Saipov fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the United States since his arrival.Generally, is it possible for one green card holder to bring in 22 or more relatives?""It may be possible, but it’s very unlikely,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute working with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program. ""Theoretically, if someone had many foreign-born children, and those children had many children, they could sponsor one spouse, plus 21 children and grandchildren. The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children.""But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said.A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members.As the New York Times and Washington Post’s Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen (he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him. There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a ""fourth-preference"" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years.The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage.Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, ""benefited from extended family chain migration"" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said.

""Atlanta is on its strongest financial footing in 40 years.""Four decades is a long time, and we wanted to give that assertion a harder look.In large measure, the claim holds up. But there are some caveats about the exact numbers that support it. Plus, measures of financial strength are always somewhat subjective.A few key indicators give a broad picture of how well any municipality is doing.There is the bond rating, which companies such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor's use to indicate the risk of lending money to the city.The rating firms bumped up Atlanta in 2016. Standard & Poor’s raised its rating to AA+ from AA. Moody’s raised its rating to AA1 from AA2. Fitch increased its rating to AA+.As far as anyone can tell, those are the best ratings the city has ever enjoyed.Fiscal analysts also look at pension fund exposure. As the number of retirees grows, live longer, and the cost of health care continues to rise, the future costs have become much larger than the cash in the pension fund needed to cover them.One of the mavens of municipal finance data, Richard Ciccarone at Merritt Research Services, gave Atlanta a mediocre grade on its pension position.""Their funding ratio is only 65.9 percent, which is not that good,"" Ciccarone said. ""It’s been worse. It has been low as 55.4 percent in 2006.""City spokeswoman Jenna Garland said the decision in 2017 to merge three pension boards into one would tighten up fund management and increase investment returns.""Improved pension fund performance will result in a reduced need for the city to fund pension benefits, freeing those funds for use for city services,"" Garland said.Not so fast, said Katherine Willoughby, professor of public administration at the University of Georgia.""I would be in a wait-and-see mode,"" Willoughby said. ""These are volatile things, and you hope the money will come in, but you don’t know until it happens.""The pension fund issue was not a significant factor in the late 1970s.A big boost in the general fundPerhaps the biggest feather in the city’s cap is the hefty balance of the general fund at the end of 2017. The general fund is Atlanta’s main account to pay for everything from fixing potholes to keeping police on the beat.It went from $153 million in 2016 to $200 million in 2017. Measured against the city’s $553 million budget, the percentage — 35.8 percent — had never been higher""Never before in the city’s history have we both had a AA+ credit rating alongside record reserves and a record percentage of the budget in reserves,"" Garland said. ""We believe the historical record would reflect that at no point from 1978 until 2016 when the city’s credit was upgraded was the City in a stronger financial position than today.""The city’s fiscal team dug into the financial archives of old Consolidated Annual Financial Reports and sent us a spreadsheet. This table is an excerpt showing four key years.: 1978, 1979, 2016 and 2017.

In those terms, 2017 is much stronger than 1978, 35 percent compared to 25 percent.Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said it’s difficult for large cities to enjoy the margin that Atlanta has.""To have 35 percent for a city the size of Atlanta is remarkable,"" Pagano said.On the other hand, while it’s fair to compare the fund to the original budget, Pagano said it’s equally fair to compare to the actual spending.""If you are asking how well you performed, then you want to compare to the actual expenditures,"" he said.Willoughby agreed, saying the budget is more theoretical, and ""it’s more anchored in reality to look at the actual spending.""When we did that, the results flipped and the early years looked better than the recent ones.YearTotal ExpendituresFund BalancePercent of Expenditures197895,055,81236,661,26438.57%1979110,880,57938,454,94134.68%2016545,822,000153,149,00028.06%2017597,180,000200,082,00033.50% At the same time, after correcting for inflation, the shear size of the fund is larger today than in the past 40 years.Neither Pagano nor Willoughby took anything away from the gains Atlanta has made, particularly in the way it has risen from the fiscal wreckage of the Great Recession. Their point was that there are different ways to crunch the numbers.And they also offered several cautionary thoughts about what lies beneath the data.In the mid-1980s, Pagano collected surveys from financial officers at the 100 largest cities. The numbers he got from Atlanta for those years (included in the full spreadsheet, but not in the excerpt above) didn’t match what the city sent us. Conclusion?Pinpoint accuracy is not in the cards. Numbers that are broadly correct are about the best you can expect, especially when looking across several decades.Willoughby and Pagano cautioned against reading too much into the one-time $71 million bolt of cash that came in 2017. Our research found that money came from the decision to liquidate two city funds, with tens of millions from the Underground Atlanta project accounting for the bulk of it.""It was a benefit for this year,"" Willoughby said. ""But you can’t count on it happening again. To pin your good fiscal health on one big drop of money is probably not appropriate.""All of the experts we reached told us that there’s always a subjective element in municipal finance.""This is more of an art than a science,"" said Tracy Gordon, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""How you combine the metrics and how you rate them involves some value judgments.""Our rulingBottoms said the city was on the strongest financial footing in 40 years. Several indicators point in that direction, though the weakest factor centers on pensions. Atlanta faces significant challenges in funding its future pension obligations. That was not a factor in 1978. However, the situation is better than a decade ago.More promising is the city’s bond rating. It is higher than ever.The relative size of the general fund also falls in the plus column. In constant dollars, the 2017 general fund is larger today than it was 40 years ago — one long-time researcher called it ""remarkable."" The fund did rely on some one-time cash infusions and a different, also reasonable, approach shows that the situation was a little better in 1978.There are factors that detract from the claim’s accuracy but the facts support the general thrust.

So what’s going on?When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger.The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort.

When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion.So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say.Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure ""is misleading if it’s the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill — $1.5 trillion.""He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed web page dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bill’s provisions.On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill ""provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts"" but that it will also ""raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts.""Our rulingTrump said the recently enacted tax law includes ""$5.5 trillion in tax cuts.""

Kevin Brady, R-Texas -- the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- said that ""70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000.""When we took a closer look, we found Brady’s statistic to be somewhat misleading.The Joint Committee on Taxation studyBrady's office pointed us to an analysis of the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan office of Congress charged with analyzing the impacts of tax bills.The committee released breakdowns of how much various income ranges would see their taxes collectively increase or decrease over the next decade. Because one of the divisions between income groups is at $200,000, it’s straightforward to break down what share of the benefits accrue above and below that income level.Brady’s office pointed us to one chart in particular. It shows the breakdown of gains on the income tax side of the proposal. Those below the $200,000 threshold get 69 percent of the benefits, while those above $200,000 get 31 percent.That’s in line with what Brady said -- but the talking point is cherry-picked.First, the ratio of gains above and below $200,000 change over time. By 2025, households below $200,000 get 52 percent, and by 2027, they get 51 percent -- still a majority, but significantly below Brady’s 70 percent figure.The bigger issue concerns what kinds of income are counted in the chart Brady used.As we’ve found in a previous fact-check, the chart Brady used addresses just the personal income tax changes in the bill. However, the bill would not only change personal income taxes; it would also change how other types of taxes are levied, including corporate and estate taxes.""A big part of the bill is slashing taxes on business income, which disproportionately affects high-income earners, as does eventually repealing estate tax,"" Len Burman, a co-founder of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us.These taxes are not factored into the personal-taxes-only data that Brady cited, so the chart he used underplays the positive impact the bill as a whole would have on wealthy households.As it happens, the same Joint Committee on Taxation assessment does analyze all aspects of the bill. We calculated the percentage of the total benefits going to those above and below $200,000 in income and summarized them here:YearPercentage of gains going to incomes under $200,000Percentage of gains going to incomes over $200,000Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021201958 percent42 percent202163 percent37 percent202562 percent37 percent202750 percent50 percent For each year, the percentages taken by the under-$200,000 households are lower than Brady’s 70 percent figure. But they are always a majority.An outside analysisCalculations from the Tax Policy Center show an even smaller share of benefits flowing to under-$200,000 households. That’s because the Joint Committee on Taxation does not include the benefits associated with eliminating the estate tax, and because the two groups use slightly different definitions of ""income.""The Tax Policy Center found that households below $200,000 in income would get about 54 percent of the House bill’s benefits. That percentage would shrink to about 31 percent by 2027.Our rulingBrady said that in the House Republican bill, ""70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000.""That’s only accurate if you look at the individual income tax portions of the House bill. Once you factor in tax changes related to business income, which tend to benefit wealthier taxpayers, the share earned by those under $200,000 is actually 58 percent in 2019, falling to 50 percent in 2027. And if you factor in the impact of the estate tax, it would be as low as 54 percent initially and 31 percent by 2027.We rate the statement Half True.

Under federal law, it was illegal for this individual to purchase a firearm. He had a conviction for a crime that’s punishable by more than a year in prison and he had a conviction for multiple domestic violence crimes.

""Number one, the Air Force, the Obama administration, didn’t report those convictions to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) database. That’s an endemic problem; it’s a problem with the federal government, it’s a problem with the states.""And so, when he went in to buy the guns, they ran the background check and they didn’t find it because it wasn’t in the database.

One, it mandated that federal agencies including the Air Force report to the NICS because that was a problem back then. But two, and this is an even more critical piece, if it had been reported to the background database, when he went into Academy to buy this, these weapons, he lied on the forms. That is a felony to lie on those forms. The Obama administration didn’t prosecute those cases. In 2010,"" Cruz said, ""48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns.

If a potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the lead investigative agency in gun enforcement.  The automated national instant background check system began operating in 1998.Some perspective: In 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia reviewed federal reports before concluding that the Justice Department hadn’t been prioritizing perjury charges in connection with background checks for at least two administrations. During George W. Bush’s presidency, there had been 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year and some 15/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. In the first two years of Obama’s presidency, 8/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted.By email, a Cruz spokesman, Phil Novack, told us Cruz drew on a 2012 federal report to reach his 2010 figures. Novack noted too that when Cruz made a similar claim in 2013, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post confirmed the declared 44 prosecutions based on information in the report.2010 statisticsIn 2010, the report says, FBI background checks led to initial denials of 72,659 applications to purchase a gun--with 34,451 denials attributed to a person’s felony indictment or conviction and 13,862 due to the person being a fugitive from justice--48,313 combined.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021But most of those denials never made it to prosecutorial consideration. The report says the ATF overturned, canceled or chose not to refer for further investigation 71,410 denial cases sent its way by the FBI; some 4,732 cases were then referred to field offices for further review. Ultimately, the report says, 62 cases were referred for federal prosecution with 18 of those not taken up by a prosecutor--which leaves 44.Then again, that doesn’t mean 44 prosecutions proceeded. That’s because a dozen referrals were still pending action by a prosecutor as of Dec. 13, 2011, the report says.Otherwise, an accompanying chart shows that the 44 possible prosecutions would have been down from 77 prosecutions the year before and 105 in 2008--and prosecutorial referrals also had declined through those years.By phone, we asked the report’s author, Ron Frandsen, about the availability of more recent data. Frandsen, who works for the Missouri-based Regional Justice Information Service, said that to his knowledge, no analyses of post-2010 data have been funded.By email, Frandsen said that most likely, the 48,321 denied applications tallied for felony or fugitive reasons were found in FBI background checks after applicants failed to disclose such information on a form.""FBI denials are referred to ATF, which investigates the cases deemed most worthy of possible prosecution. From the 2010 FBI denials, ATF referred 62 charges (against 33 people) to U.S. or state attorneys for possible prosecution,"" Frandsen said, involving nine different federal offenses and two to seven state offenses.Frandsen said Cruz was accurate in his reference to 48,000 denials. He said the reference to 44 prosecutions wasn’t accurate because the ""44"" from the service’s report refers to charges, not individual people, and those charges involved ""more than just felons and fugitives, and,"" Frandsen wrote, ""because some of the prosecutorial decisions were made by state attorneys.""There’s more data available, PolitiFact reporters have noted, in a 2013 analysis of federal weapons cases by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, based at Syracuse University. The analysis doesn’t mention background checks directly. But a chart lists 123 prosecutions in 2010 in which the lead charge was making false/fictitious statements in order to acquire a firearm or ammunition. The comparable count was 143 in 2011 and 170 in 2012, the chart states. The relevant law says it’s unlawful for anyone acquiring a firearm from a licensed dealer to knowingly make false or fictitious oral or written statements intended to deceive the seller about the sale’s legality.Explaining the few prosecutionsWhy has Uncle Sam seemingly been reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general provided several answers. It said ATF agents viewed the violations ""as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives"" and ""saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm.""The report also said that the cases lack ""jury appeal"" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation ""juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle.""Frandsen told us he hasn’t researched in depth why few violations get prosecuted. But, he said, such cases are hard to prosecute ""because the government must prove that the denied person intentionally failed to disclose a prohibition on the federal form (as opposed to just being unaware of what was on their record)."" Also, he said, there’s a belief that the main purpose of the background check requirement is to prevent a firearm transfer to a prohibited person--and the additional step of prosecution ""should be reserved for the most dangerous people, especially those with an extensive criminal history.""Our rulingCruz said: ""In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns"" and the Obama administration ""prosecuted only 44 of them.""There may have been even fewer federal prosecutions of such felons and fugitives, figures indicate, though Cruz failed to note that this paucity wasn’t unique to one administration. It’s also worth clarifying that we don’t know if all 48,000 individuals knowingly misled the government. Few of the tallied background checks resulted in further investigation.We rate Cruz's claim Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Nick Marshall, R-Parkville, was critical of the political rhetoric and expressed his discontent in an Oct. 2 Missourinet article.""When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know,"" Marshall said.State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Richmond Heights, told Missourinet that Marshall was incorrect on automatic weapons being a federal issue. She pointed to House Bill 294, which passed in 2011.""Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri,"" Newman said. ""We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.""We were wondering, are machine guns legal in Missouri? Are they under federal or state jurisdiction? And, has Missouri loosened restrictions on them? We tried to reach out to Newman to clarify her statement, but received no response.We spoke with people knowledgeable on gun laws in Missouri, who said that when it came to Newman’s statement, there’s context missing and multiple ways to interpret it.Regulating machine gunsBasically, a machine gun is an automatic weapon that is capable of firing more than one round per trigger pull, Allen Rostron, law professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, said in an email. A semi-automatic requires a finger pull for each round but automatically loads the chamber after a shot.The sale of automatic weapons has been restricted since the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. The act was inspired, in part, because of frequent use of machine guns in crime, including the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in Chicago and the 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City.The original act imposed a tax on automatic weapons and required they be registered with the Secretary of the Treasury, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.""It essentially amounted to a ban, because it became a crime to possess a machine gun without having it properly registered with the government,"" Rostron said. ""But technically it wasn’t actually a ban, because it didn’t prohibit machine guns. It just made them subject to much stricter regulations than other guns.""In 1986, Congress passed additional regulations that cut off the supply of new machine guns to civilian buyers. Any existing machine guns manufactured before May 19, 1986, are still allowed to be purchased and were grandfathered into the law.Essentially, that’s where the federal law stands today.""There are something like 400,000 or 500,000 of these machine guns that are legally possessed by civilians in the United States,"" Rostron said.State vs. federalPrior to 2011, Missouri prohibited the possession of machine guns in the state. HB 294, which Newman referenced, ""Allows a person to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell a machine gun, short barreled rifle or shotgun, or firearm silencer if he or she conforms with federal law,"" according to the bill summary. The bill passed by a majority in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Jay Nixon.""So in other words, Missouri went from having a stricter law that completely banned machine guns to having a law that said you’re allowed to have a machine gun if federal law permits it,"" Rostron said.Featured Fact-checkRon Johnsonstated on February 15, 2021 in a radio interviewSays Jan. 6 Capitol riot “didn’t seem like an armed insurrection.”By Eric Litke • February 15, 2021As of April 2017, there were 9,588 machine guns registered in Missouri, according to a 2017 ATF report, said Hannah Shearer, staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for more restrictive gun regulation.So is Marshall or Newman correct that machine guns are a federal or state issue? Well, it depends.Marshall is correct that federal law has the ultimate jurisdiction over machine guns. However, states can impose stricter laws that go beyond federal law, such as Missouri did prior to 2011.""Rep. Marshall’s statement is incomplete or inaccurate to the extent it suggests state law is completely irrelevant to this,"" Rostron said. ""So it is not purely a federal issue as he seemed to suggest.""However, Newman’s statement could also be misleading. She is correct that machine guns were legalized in Missouri, but they must still comply with federal law.""If her statement gives people the impression that machine guns have been legalized in Missouri and so now they’re not subject to any special restrictions, then that is not correct, because machine guns remain subject to the federal (National Firearms Act) restrictions that apply throughout the nation,"" Rostron said.However, other experts disagreed, and claimed that machine guns are solely a federal issue.""This is theater,"" St. Louis University School of Law Professor Anders Walker said in an email about Newman’s statement. ""Machine guns are controlled by federal law, full stop,"" and linked to a Giffords Law Center webpage. An NRA spokeswoman agreed.Kevin Jamison, attorney and president of the Western Missouri Shooters Alliance, pointed to the fact that no state agency regulates machine guns, and said that the only difference is that the Missouri law allows prosecutors to try a case in a Missouri court.""Doesn’t happen very often, but it could possibly happen,"" Jamison said.Loosening restrictions?Newman also said, ""Ever since (House Bill 294 passed), continually my whole time in the Legislature, we have loosened restriction.""Experts said the accuracy of Newman’s statement depends on whether she was referring to machine guns specifically or gun laws in general.When it comes to machine guns, experts said Missouri has not loosened restrictions since 2011.However, Shearer pointed out that the state has loosened restriction on gun laws more generally.""Rep. Newman is also correct that Missouri has weakened its gun laws over time, including last year, when state lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto to enact permitless concealed carry,"" Shearer said. ""Missouri’s weak laws correlate with a comparatively high gun death rate. In 2016 Missouri had the ninth highest per capita gun death rate among all the states,"" pointing to a Giffords Law Center scorecard.Our rulingNewman said, Missouri legalized machine guns.There’s some truth to that, but also some caveats. In 2011, the Missouri legislature overturned a full ban of automatic weapons. But all that did was make state law comply with federal law. Federal law doesn’t outright ban machine guns, but it does heavily regulate them. Generally, machine guns are hard to acquire.We rate this claim Half True.","http://www.missourinet.com/2017/10/02/missouri-lawmakers-condemn-las-vegas-shooting/,http://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB294&year=2011&code=R,https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/national-firearms-act,https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/49,http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills111/sumpdf/HB0294T.pdf,/personalities/ron-johnson/,/factchecks/2021/feb/15/ron-johnson/yes-jan-6-capitol-assault-was-armed-insurrection/,https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/undefined/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017/download,http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/hardware-ammunition/machine-guns-50-caliber/,http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/",,"Missouri,Guns,Stacey Newman",,,,,

This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country."" But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.)The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years.So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year.That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever.The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale.Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger.Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax billInflation-adjusted dollars American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013)$321 billionTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010$210 billionEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981$208 billionCurrent tax proposal$150 billion - $220 billionRevenue Act of 1964$64 billionRevenue Act of 1945$60 billionRevenue Act of 1978Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021$55 billionRevenue Act of 1948$38 billion At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill.And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax billPercentage of GDPEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 19812.89 percentRevenue Act of 19452.67 percentRevenue Act of 19481.87 percentAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013)1.78 percentRevenue Act of 19641.6 percentTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 20101.31 percentCurrent tax proposal0.8 percent-1.2 percentRevenue Act of 19780.8 percent  By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP.The group added in a blog post that ""if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.""No formulation of the current proposal is close to that.""Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it’s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history,"" said Joseph J.

Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate.McFarlane, reacting to Francis’ announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they haven’t debated.""We debated multiple times,"" McFarlane said. ""I’m not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that we’ve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five.""How can one candidate say he’s still waiting to debate while another says they’ve debated ""multiple times?"" Because they appear to have different definitions of the word ""debate.""Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one.""Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race,"" he said in a statement. ""Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision.""McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters.Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate.That may be true. But that doesn’t necessarily mean either candidate’s definition of ""debate"" is accurate.Defining debateMerriam-Webster defines ""debate"" as ""a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides"" and Dictionary.com says it’s ""a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints.""By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions.The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988.The commission doesn’t offer a definition for a ""debate"" or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals.The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they don’t necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate.Key componentsThey all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals.The experts cast doubt on McFarlane’s claim that forums qualify as debates.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they don’t.""Unless they’re addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldn’t be a political debate,"" McLennan said.Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as ""joint appearances."" He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that.He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates ""are not much good if you don’t have an audience.""Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesn’t think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying there’s got to be ""crossfire.""""When we talk about what is a debate, we’re talking about an organized clash,"" Imbody said. ""‘If there’s no clash or discord, then there’s nothing to debate. You’re just giving speeches.""So let’s look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlane’s campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact.Raleigh eventsOn Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlane’s campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates.""During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members,"" Sonneman said.The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate.In closing comments, Francis said, ""I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight.""On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. ""As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered,"" he said.On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question.In Monday’s press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other.""They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose,"" Rindge said. ""However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate.""Our rulingMcFarlane said she has debated Francis ""multiple times."" The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back.

He then opted out of his 49ers contract and has not been re-signed.Many people think Kaepernick has been blacklisted by the NFL for his protests. USA Today and ESPN then reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem. The stories both used anonymous sources, because Kaepernick had not (and as of this writing, still has not) spoken publicly about whether he would continue his protests.On Oct. 8, 2017, CBS Sports reporter Jason La Canfora told The NFL Today host James Brown that Kaepernick wanted to play in the NFL again. Brown asked La Canfora, who said he had spoken to Kaepernick the night before, whether the quarterback would continue to kneel in protest.""He's not planning on kneeling,"" La Canfora answered.That garnered some attention in the sports world, but upon further review, La Canfora walked back his remarks. He clarified his answer via Twitter shortly after the broadcast, writing that that he had not actually asked Kaepernick about his protests.Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about sat.

However, I cant say if they are true or not. Colin and I didn't discuss— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 8, 2017In an apparent response to La Canfora, Kaepernick tweeted the quote later that day.""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.

This and other misattributed Churchill quotes often spread online, he said.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post""Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.""By Bill McCarthy • February 8, 2021""The irony is that today such misattributed quotes circle the globe a thousand times before the truth even begins to think about putting on pants,"" Riley said.Churchill historian Richard Langworth found the saying traced back to President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, who wrote: ""A lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on.""Langworth also noted Churchill would have said trousers, not breeches, so there’s that. But we’re still only partially dressed with that explanation.This quote has dozens of variations, stretching back quite some time. If we go to 1919, Mark Twain got credit for saying, ""A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.""(Samuel Clemens died in 1910, by the way.)Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon allegedly used a version with boots in it back in 1855. The saying sometimes substitutes shoes. In 1840, it was credited to Thomas Jefferson.There’s an entire history of the saying on QuoteInvestigator.com, citing sources that attribute versions of it to all manner of outlets, from magazines to Chinese proverbs.The origins of the quote reach all the way back to the 18th century.One version is attributed to English clergyman Thomas Francklin. ""Falsehood will fly, as it were, on the wings of the wind, and carry its tales to every corner of the earth; whilst truth lags behind; her steps, though sure, are slow and solemn,"" he wrote in a 1787 sermon.But Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and amateur etymologist, told PolitiFact that she and other word investigators found a probable origin with no mention of boots or pants.""Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it,"" Jonathan Swift wrote in The Examiner in 1710.""I should note that it's possible, though maybe not terribly likely, that the metaphor wasn't entirely Swift's,"" Taylor-Blake said. ""He may have adapted it from an earlier, now-unknown form, even a version not then in English.""Our rulingKaepernick credited Churchill for saying, ""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.""This is a quote that often is attributed to the British prime minister, but there’s no record of him saying it. But that’s a common mistake, experts told us. The line has grown and evolved — and then credited to different people — many times over hundreds of years, potentially starting with a version by Swift in 1710.This is a broken play by Kaepernick.

Another ironically wrote that he ""couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture.""The Vets for Trump Facebook page didn’t accept messages or list phone or email information. It listed as contact information the website VeteransForDonaldTrump.com, a domain registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets.  Trump targeted the NFL after a handful of players had decided to kneel during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, as a protest against racism in America. Trump demanded on Twitter that NFL players ""stop disrespecting our Flag & Country"" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand.More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either).Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day.Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke.The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016, and is credited to Rob Mar on the team’s website.What do you do in the victory locker room?

He said at a CNN town hall event on Sept. 27 that the protests were ""about treating people like human beings.""""The changes start with the heart,"" he said. ""This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing.

Ted Cruz.",,politifact,,"A West Texas Democrat seeking to represent the state in the U.S. Senate asserts that he’s already running even with incumbent Ted Cruz, who won the seat with 57 percent of the vote in 2012 before later running for president.In an August 2017 Facebook post, El Paso U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign said: ""Beto O’Rourke out-raised Senator Ted Cruz in the second financial quarter without taking a DIME from PACs, and the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck.""O’Rourke indeed raised more money than Cruz from April through June 2017 though Cruz, a Republican, ended the quarter with a balance of $5.7 million in campaign cash compared to O’Rourke’s $1.9 million. Also, we’ve previously noted that O’Rourke no longer takes PAC contributions.Let’s focus the Truth-O-Meter this time on whether the latest polls show O’Rourke ""tied neck-and-neck"" with Cruz.To our inquiry, Jody Casey of O’Rourke’s campaign emailed us a web link to an April 2017 USA Today Network news story headlined ""O’Rourke, Castro running even with Cruz, poll shows,"" Castro being U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, who later said he wouldn’t be challenging Cruz.According to the USA Today Network story, a statewide poll of 1,000 adults commissioned by the Texas Lyceum, a leadership group, found 30 percent of respondents favoring Cruz, 30 percent backing O’Rourke.That’s neck and neck--albeit with 40 percent of the respondents not accounted for.Texas Lyceum pollFor the full skinny, we turned to the Lyceum’s post about the poll, which specifies that the poll was conducted statewide April 3-9, 2017, and that 890 respondents who self-identified as registered voters answered this question: ""If the 2018 election for Senate were held today, would you vote for the Republican Ted Cruz, the Democrat Beto O’Rourke, or haven’t you thought enough about it?"" Each time, the order of the names was randomized, according to the results.   SOURCE: Documents showing topline results and crosstabs, 2017 Texas Lyceum Poll, April 18, 2017 (accessed Sept. 11, 2017)Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Beyond the 30 percent-30 percent split between O’Rourke and Cruz, the results indicate, 37 percent of respondents said they hadn’t thought enough about it with 3 percent refusing to reply or saying they didn’t know.By phone, Josh Blank the Texas Lyceum’s research director, told us that an observer could read the results as indicative of a neck-and-neck race; he said he thinks it’s too soon to reach that conclusion. ""The electorate isn’t knowledgeable enough yet,"" Blank said. The April poll ""is mainly a reflection of name identification and voter attitudes about"" Cruz, he said.By email, Blank noted that among the 37 percent of respondents who did not choose between Cruz and O’Rourke, 36 percent identified as moderates, 33 percent identified as conservatives, and 19 percent identified as liberals. That is, Blank said, ""a larger share of voters who admitted to not yet having a preference identify as conservative as opposed to liberal. When they choose to tune into the race, they are going to be predisposed towards supporting Cruz over O'Rourke.""Republicans underrepresented?We asked Mike Baselice of Austin, a pollster for Republican clients who’s not working for Cruz, to assess the April poll results. By email, Baselice suggested that the poll showed Cruz and O’Rourke with identical levels of support because it surveyed too few Republicans considering the actual Texas electorate. In the poll, 27 percent of adults identified as Republican, 32 percent as Democratic and 40 percent as Independent. Thirty-seven percent self-identified as conservative, 34 percent as moderate, 21 percent as liberal.Baselice wrote: ""Our surveys have shown an 8-10"" percentage ""point Republican advantage over Democrats in terms of partisan vote behavior. ""You can look at the down-ballot races where the vast majority of the candidates are unknown to the voters, and yet we see that Republicans defeated Democrats statewide by an average of 15 points in 2016,"" Baselice said. That margin, by our calculation, averaged 14.8 percentage points across seven races, one for the Texas Railroad Commission and six for judicial posts.Blank, asked about Baselice’s comment, said by email that the April poll intentionally gathered the opinions of more people than likely voters. Blank said future polls, closer to the November 2018 election, will be filtered to ""make the measurement of the electorate more conservative, and more in-line with the ultimate outcome ""Texas Tribune surveyBlank noted that more recently, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey of 1,200 Texas adults taken from June 2-11, 2017, found few people familiar with O’Rourke, who’s making his first bid for statewide office.That poll didn’t ask people to pick between Cruz and O’Rourke. Rather, 18 percent of respondents held a favorable view of O’Rourke, 15 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 13 percent felt unfavorable--with 55 percent not knowing or having no opinion. In contrast, the poll found 37 percent of respondents with a favorable view of Cruz, 12 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 45 percent unfavorable--with 6 percent not knowing or having no opinion.We otherwise heard back from Jim Williams of North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which serves Democratic clients. By phone, Williams said the firm last polled Texans about the 2018 U.S. Senate race in August 2016. That poll suggested Cruz would lead Democrat Wendy Davis or Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary; it didn’t test Cruz versus O’Rourke.Our rulingO’Rourke said ""the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck"" with Cruz.An April 2017 poll showed a 30 percent-30 percent race though a plurality of registered voters indicated they didn’t know enough to commit either way and the poll folded in too many Democrats. O’Rourke didn’t identify any other poll of the match-up nor did we find one.We rate this claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Sean Duffy recently argued for an increase in military spending, claiming the U.S. military’s air fleet is antiquated and leaves the nation at risk.Duffy’s push for more military spending came during a July 20, 2017, interview on The World Over with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN, days before Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the U.S. Senate. Duffy’s claim arose from a question by Arroyo about whether the U.S. spends too much on defense.Duffy (R-Wisconsin) responded with a firm ""no,"" then rattled off a series of familiar talking points about the nation’s military: the military is depleted; there’s peace through strength; and it’s vital to stay ahead of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.To drive his message home, he made a very specific claim about the U.S. air fleet.""We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology,"" Duffy said.Duffy’s wider point about a depleted military is one PolitiFact has addressed in fact checks of other politicians, such as Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan.In this item, we’ll look at whether the U.S. is really flying planes from 1987 that have 1987 technology and what that says about the state of the military.Aging aircraftIn 2015, Duffy did a fly-along in an F-16 with the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s 115th Fighter Wing in Madison. On the visit, staffers from the Air National Guard told him the planes were built in 1987 and had 1987 technology, aides to Duffy told us.""He received that information from the Wisconsin Air National Guard and took their professional guidance on the matter,"" said Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar.Capt. Joe Trovato, deputy director of public affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs, confirmed the fly-along happened and that Duffy recalled the conversation correctly. The F-16’s assigned to that specific fighter wing were built between 1986 and 1988, with the bulk in 1987.The conversation, however, was specifically about the F-16 and how peer or near-peer nations such as China and Russia are catching up and can match or exceed F-16 technology.In the EWTN interview, Duffy offered a broad statement about the nation’s military aircraft, without limiting it to specific planes or providing a sense of how many planes may fit the criteria.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021In any case, there is more to the story.The body and engines on the F-16’s in question remain largely the same as they did when they rolled off the assembly line. But in the years since, the government has upgraded weapons, sensors and software on the planes, Trovato said.For instance, they now have better GPS locator systems and better weapons and munitions.The aerospace policy experts we spoke with agreed with Duffy’s general sentiment, but said it passes over important context, such as the upgrades to the fighters.""These older aircraft have been upgraded and modernized over time,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank. ""While the airframe may be old, the cockpit, navigation systems, sensors, and other electronics have been modernized.""An F-16 flying today is much more capable and technologically advanced than when it rolled off the assembly line in the 1980s.""Still, Harrison and others said, there are limits to the upgrades: The F-16 can’t be upgraded to have the stealth capabilities common in the much newer F-22 Raptors or F-35 Lightnings.Laura McAndrews, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, said in an email that the average age of aircraft in the Air Force is 27, and fighter and attack aircraft specifically have an average age of 25.Typically, when the military wants to introduce a new generation of aircraft, it can take two decades to get an aircraft from the conceptual stage to test stage and finally full integration into the nation’s air fleet, according to Harrison and other policy experts.The F-22 Raptors, which first got off the ground in tests in the 1990s, are among the most recent additions. The Air Force has 183 of them, according to fact sheets.The F-35 Lightnings, a program started in 2001, are part of a controversial $400 billion order that, over 20 years, aims to replace aging aircraft across three branches of the military, according to the Department of Defense.Our rating Duffy said, ""We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology.""In the case of the airplanes Duffy based his claim on, the engine and body remain largely the same as in 1987, but experts and the military say the F-16 has undergone other technological upgrades. In addition, Duffy’s statement is more general, which ignores ongoing efforts to modernize the fleet and purchase and design new craft.We rate his claim Half True.

He made his escape by swimming through chemical waste, which turned his skin white and his hair green. He took his name from the eponymous playing card and has been arching Batman ever since.But something sounded off to this fact-checker, who thought Shapiro had a point about the Joker’s past being mysterious. PolitiFact has written about whether there’s been a female Thor, and whether Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot or Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill is paid more money, so we have some experience.In true geek fashion, we raised this objection with Tapper, saying that the Red Hood origin story was just the one with which people were most familiar.""Because it's the true one,"" Tapper replied.Because it's the true one— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) August 23, 2017We’ll see about that.Red Hood or red herring?The most succinct reply to this came from Nick Valente, a publicist for DC Comics.""You are correct, there is no definitive backstory for the Joker,"" he said.CASE CLOSED!But wait! Like most comic book plotlines, there’s always room for this story to expand and change.The Joker has been around almost as long as Batman himself, first appearing in 1940s Batman No. 1, when the Dark Knight got his own title after starting in Detective Comics a year earlier.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021There have been several iterations of the character, but through the decades he has been portrayed largely as a psychotic killer, bent on antagonizing Batman and the people of Gotham City.The Joker had no backstory to speak of until 1951, when the anecdote about the Red Hood that Tapper cited was printed. Versions of this origin have appeared in various forms over the years, with details changed.Glen Weldon, author of The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture‎, said that DC gave the character an origin story, but that was ""back in the halcyon days before a ravenous fanbase insisted that every random story must calcify into canonical truth.""One of the most famous modern versions of the Red Hood story is Alan Moore’s account in 1988’s The Killing Joke, in which the Joker is a former engineer and failed comedian who leads armed robbers into his former employer, Ace Chemical Processing, Inc., after the death of his pregnant wife. He wears the Red Hood as a disguise and jumps into the chemicals to flee Batman.But that doesn’t mean we should believe the Joker, because, well, he’s the Joker. He’s an unreliable narrator, because his insanity keeps him from telling the truth, and us from knowing the difference.Even Moore’s version of the Joker acknowledged that his story is essentially unknowable.""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another,"" the Joker said. ""If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!""There are plenty of other variations of the story. Sometimes Batman knocks the Joker into the vat, sometimes the hapless criminal jumps. Sometimes the Red Hood isn’t involved at all. Later storylines show that the Red Hood is an alias adopted by many other criminals. Eventually, even Batman’s sidekick Robin dons the Red Hood.""Since that (1951) story was first published, just about every time any comic's made even the most casual reference to Joker's origin, the Red Hood bit has come and gone, but the ‘fall into a vat of acid, goes nuts’ thing remains,"" Weldon said.The movies complicate things further.In the 1989 film version of Batman, Jack Nicholson’s Joker is a lifelong criminal named Jack Napier (the only time the Joker is given a first and last name) who actually is the man who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents. The late Heath Ledger’s acclaimed 2008 take on the Joker in The Dark Knight gives a nod to the ambiguity of it all, with the grease-painted antagonist telling different characters more than one version of how he was disfigured. (There’s also an offshoot movie based on Jared Leto’s tattooed Joker and Harley Quinn from 2016’s Suicide Squad coming, but that’s a different set of issues altogether.)DC Comics recognizes that their most famous villain juggles the truth. Their Origin of the Joker showed the killer acknowledging that even he gets confused by which story is right.""Though the Red Hood story — in its blurriest form of spills and chemical burns — is perhaps the most-pointed to origin story for the Joker, it is by no means the definitive one,"" said Brad Ricca, SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and a comics historian.Recent comic book storylines have suggested that Batman has actually matched wits with three different Jokers through the years. Other stories hint further that the Joker may be immortal. The character has cycled through several personalities and backstories, sometimes insane and sometimes not, but always a dark-humored and lethal opponent for Batman. That’s the strength of comic books, which are free to retroactively change the continuity however the creators see fit, our experts said.Will Brooker, a film and cultural studies professor at Kingston University, said that the most sinister aspect of the character is that inability to define how he became the way he is.""My feeling is that to pin Joker down to a fixed backstory and identity is reductive, unimaginative and suggests a lack of understanding of what Joker is really about,"" said Brooker, author of Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon.""He is essentially the opposite of Batman, who has a fixed, definite origin. The whole point is that Batman can never work out who Joker is and where he came from.""Our rulingTapper said the Joker's ""Red Hood"" origin story is ""the true one.""That's right, we're fact-checking where the Joker came from. So sue us!This claim is throwing down the gauntlet for comic book nerds, pointing to a 1951 backstory about the Joker wearing a disguise and swimming through chemical waste as the one, true origin of the archvillain. He may prefer that version, and that’s fine, because it’s not wrong. But comic historians and even a DC Comics publicist we consulted agreed that the Joker has no definitive backstory — indeed, that is one of the defining strengths of the character.We rate Tapper’s statement Mostly False.

""They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — Federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.""Under its Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines Chicago’s ""sanctuary city"" status, the Chicago Police Department ""will not question crime victims, witnesses and other law-abiding residents about their legal status."" It also will not use immigration status alone as grounds for detention, and it imposes strict limits on interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents.Like other cities with similar policies, Chicago says doing so fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department, so immigrants won’t fear coming to police to report crime or assist police investigations.Accusing the Chicago Police Department of maintaining ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" is a pretty serious charge from the nation’s top law enforcement officer. We thought this deserved a closer look.Punching bag cityChicago was one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city’s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to ""send in the feds"" to tamp down the city’s crime.If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 Sessions’ invocation of ""criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump’s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime.On Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago’s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration.""Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies are just one sad example,"" Sessions said. ""...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths – zero.""The alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions’ statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim.The response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--""deep background,"" ""background,"" ""not for attribution,"" and ""off the record"" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of ""All The President’s Men"" for guidance. But to no avail.To be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won’t.So what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.) Where to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there’s no way to be 100 percent sure there’s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago’s homicide rate.At the same time, the article does state flatly, ""There’s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates.""It also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ’s position. While 84 percent of Chicago’s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports.""FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity,"" the article states. It’s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren’t driving up Chicago’s homicide rate, it continues, but ""this isn’t what we’d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago’s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America.""DOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state’s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide.Still, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation.""The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country,"" Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. ""So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal.""Against those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions’ assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago’s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents.""Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates,"" said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences.One of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016:Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors.""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" he said in an email interview. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.""Crime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said.The NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.""Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000,"" that report said.These studies blow a big hole in Sessions’ underlying assertion of ""criminal aliens"" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago.Sanctuary safetyBut what about Sessions’ allegation that Chicago’s ""official policy"" protects ""criminal aliens?""CPD’s directive ""Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status"" lays out the do’s and don’ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony.The city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: ""(T)his policypromotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigrationstatus, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testifyas a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions.""A 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed ""sanctuary city"" policies bolsters Chicago’s case.""Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties,"" the report said. ""The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts.""The problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can’t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago’s favor appears strong, but it’s still anecdotal.Our rulingU.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago’s leaders ""have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.""Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents.But evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of ""protecting criminal aliens"" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can’t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants ""who prey on their own residents.""That absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn’t give him license to make claims that are groundless. Chicago’s sanctuary city policy does not protect undocumented people who commit crimes, despite what Sessions claims. Only the  microscopic sliver of ambiguity about conclusive data prevents us from labeling his statement ""Pants on Fire,"" our lowest possible credibility rating. Instead, we rate it False.

Thus, a 12-pack priced at $4 costs $5.97 at the register. The new tax adds 67 cents to a two-liter bottle. If marked on the shelf at $2.49, the new tax means you’ll pay 40 percent more at checkout.That’s how it works in Chicago, where the total price figures to be slightly higher than in the rest of Cook County even though the soda tax applies in the suburbs as well. Does that make Chicago-bought soda ""among the most expensive in the country?""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021Elite companyThe institute grants its statement a lot of leeway by using the word ""among.""Wherever the thirsty buy it, a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp. So the add-on cost of taxes is likely the prime factor behind any significant price differences. To date, the list of places embracing a soda tax is an extremely short one, hence Chicago’s (and Cook County’s) emergence as among the most expensive places to pop for a pop.As it stands today, Cook County is one of only eight U.S. locations to impose or plan to impose a per-ounce tax on sweetened drinks. The other seven are cities and, with a population of 5.2 million, Cook County is by far the largest jurisdiction to adopt such a tax.Issue-wise, this is right in the Illinois Policy Institute’s wheelhouse. It not only piles expense onto an extremely popular category of consumer products, but it also comes swathed in nanny state good intentions for the health of Cook County residents. By strange coincidence, this health concern arrives just as Cook County finds itself in desperate financial straits. (In another article, the institute claims Cook County can’t even get its nanny state act right, as federal rules prohibit applying the new tax to sweetened drinks purchased with food stamps. It notes that ""polling shows people with lower incomes are more likely to drink soda."")At one cent per ounce, Cook County is on the lower end of the soda tax scale. In Boulder, Colo., that two-liter soda will cost an extra $1.35 and a 12-pack will be $2.88 more. Cook County is also one of the three jurisdictions in which voters did not voluntarily adopt the tax by referendum. (Illinois has no provision for such referenda.)There have been many complaints that Cook County’s soda tax was sold to voters as an anti-obesity measure but also includes drinks containing non-caloric sweeteners. But the ordinance itself contains extensive language citing studies that link even diet drink consumption to kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity.Cook County and the city of Philadelphia are the only places where drinks sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners also are subject to the tax.Thus, even among the eight places in the nation taxing or preparing to tax consumers by the ounce for sweetened soft drinks, Cook County’s measure reaches an especially broad swath of consumers.Our rulingThe Illinois Policy Institute cites Cook County’s new sweetened drink tax as making soda sold in the city of Chicago ""among the most expensive in the country.""With Chicago already charging the nation’s highest sales tax of any major city plus a 3-percent soft drink tax, it’s almost certain that consumers in the city paid ""among"" the highest prices for soft drinks in the country even before the Aug. 2 arrival of the sweetened drink tax.But Chicago truly moved into a select group when its home county joined the seven other cities that have enacted or are poised to enact by-the-ounce taxes on sweetened soft drinks.With a nod to Captain Obvious, we raise a glass of flattened, left-out-in-the-open Coke in the direction of the Illinois Policy Institute as we rate this statement True.

Greg Abbott, said: ""Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers.""By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia offered as the basis of Patrick’s claim a state publication presenting statistics such as student enrollment. We did not spot information in the document speaking to what Patrick said.Texas Education Agency figuresBut when we reached out to the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded by pointing out state-posted figures for the 2015-16 school year, the latest year of audited spending totals.That year, according to the agency, state government recorded receipts of $58,796,907,294 related to public schools from state, local, federal and other revenue sources. The same year, according to another agency web page, 347,328 teachers were paid combined base salaries of $18,023,516,741, averaging $51,892.That $18 billion breaks out to 31 percent of the nearly $59 billion in total receipts.Some more money went to teachers, though, in nearly $1 million in stipends such as what’s paid to teachers that oversee extracurricular activities, Callahan told us. The resulting total teacher compensation, $19,005,561,634, divides out to 32 percent of the total education receipts.Additional money goes into other salaries. According to the agency, Texas schools in 2015-16 paid more than $24 billion to 68,699 teacher support staff — broken out by TEA into more than 20 job categories including counselors, school nurses and athletic trainers — plus 237,460 administrative, professional, paraprofessional and auxiliary staff — with spending on all employee salaries accounting for more than 70 percent of school-related receipts.Keep in mind, though, Patrick singled out the share of all spending solely devoted to teacher pay.School district advocatesWhen we asked finance experts who advocate for school districts if the equation based on TEA data holds up, we heard back that the math works, but the total-spending figure folds in spending deserving of an asterisk.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021In emails, Joe Wisnoski, a former TEA finance administrator who advises and lobbies for school districts, and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials each suggested it’s unfair to compare the $18 billion spent on teacher salaries to total receipts, which count money that doesn’t play into school employee salaries, each expert wrote.Wisnoski suggested it’s more appropriate to compare spending on teacher salaries to operating expenditures, which means not judging the teacher salaries against any money districts raise in bond proceeds or what’s spent on capital projects such as buildings or to pay off debt. Wisnoski noted that none of those funding streams would be available to could be diverted to salaries anyway.According to the TEA’s posted figures for 2015-16, 2015-16 ""all funds"" operating expenditures for schools totaled nearly $49.5 billion --of which the spending on teacher salaries accounted for 36.4 percent, Wisnoski said and we confirmed.""There are lots of ways to include or exclude things in the world of school district finances,"" Wisnoski said, ""and what is most appropriate somewhat depends on the person making the point and the specific point being made.""Canby called the equation that got us to 32 percent of all spending going to teacher salaries a misleading ""apples divided by oranges calculation."" He said he would gauge the share of spending on teacher salaries, starting from 2016 actual expenditure totals he said he fetched from the state’s Public Education Information Management System. Those figures suggest that teacher salaries cost $19,131,375,774 with benefits adding $3,429,356,293. The resulting $22,560,732,067 accounted for 47.7 percent of $47,303,105,584 in operating expenditures statewide, Canby noted.Canby also emailed us a web link to a July 2017 commentary by TASBO’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, stating that the group had been unable to verify numbers aired by Patrick indicating that of $163,000 spent per classroom, $52,000 is paid to classroom teachers.Ginsburg encouraged readers to consider a June 2017 report by Moak, Casey & Associates, the lobbying and consulting firm whose associates include Wisnoski. That report says that in 2015-16, Texas school employee salaries and benefits absorbed 79 percent of $46.4 billion spent on ""basic educational costs.""The share of that spending on teacher salaries alone doesn’t appear in the report, which states that ""instruction"" accounted for 61 percent of basic costs, taking into account some 333,000 teachers plus 63,700 education aides. The ""instruction"" entry in the report says: ""Also included here are the salaries and benefits costs of 4,500 librarians as well as the books and other materials that can be found in Texas school libraries. The cost of instructional materials and staff development are also included in this category as instructional costs.""Our rulingPatrick said: ""Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers.""This percentage, we found, aligns with the simple comparison of total teacher salaries to all funds spent on public schools. But it’s worth clarifying that not all funds can be diverted to teacher salaries. You could also say that close to half of available school spending in 2015-16 went to teacher salaries.We rate the statement Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Gov. Gavin Newsom.So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day.He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017:""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay.""This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated Mostly True his assertion that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, we rated Mostly False his statement that ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days.""In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries.We’ll fact-check this claim below.First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race.Governor’s raceNewsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction.Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player.As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race.Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook.Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide.Our researchWe interpreted Newsom’s claim of ""shot and killed"" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides.To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called ""Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010.""The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said.Authors of study weigh inWe contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as ""accurate.""""Yes, what he said seems accurate,"" David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. ""I think anyone who looks at the data would agree.""Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct.Grinshteyn described the report as ""purely an academic study.""She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation.On its website, the foundation says it supports ""research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms.""Related studyIn 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries.""PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides.It rated her claim Mostly True, citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other ""civilized countries.""But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine.Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries  as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.""If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed,"" she added.We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back.Our ratingCandidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries.""Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate.Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts.His statement could have used this additional information.In the end, we rated Newsom’s claim Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

It’s one or the other.Trump continued to blur the difference when he compared the obligations of China and the United States under the deal.""China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" Trump said. ""So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.""We asked the White House to tell us what part of the Paris agreement gave China permission to build coal-fired plants and what part banned them for America. We did not hear back.What’s really in the Paris agreementThe international declaration is big on the word ""should"" and light on the word ""shall.""As Boston College law professor David Wirth wrote in 2016, the distinction is crucial.""Even the most cursory review of the text of the Paris Agreement discloses a careful, purposeful alternation between the mandatory 'shall' — indicating a binding obligation governed by international law — and the hortatory 'should' — nonbinding statements of strictly political intent without legal force,"" Wirth wrote.The agreement says nations shall say publicly how much they will aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they shall report their progress. It’s up to each country to come up with its own plan, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to meet the overall goal to limit the world’s temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels.But then it says signatory countries ""should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies.""In other words, the public plan and reporting is a must-do, but the actual doing is optional.Of importance to Trump’s comparison, the agreement treats developed and developing countries differently:""Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Comparing Trump’s words to the agreementWirth told us that Trump’s words are technically inaccurate.""Nobody is allowing China to do anything, and nobody is prohibiting China from doing anything,"" Wirth said. ""And the same is true for the United States.""The agreement never uses the word coal, much less spells out how many coal-fired plants any country can build.As for China’s blueprint for what it plans to do, it does give itself until 2030 for its greenhouse gas emissions to peak. In contrast, the U.S. blueprint says ""the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025.""Critics of the arrangement point to China’s rising emissions as evidence of a fundamental unfairness. As Trump put it, the Chinese ""can do whatever they want for 13 years.""Again, Trump’s language gives more legal weight to the agreement than it actually has, but he also overlooks other parts of China’s plan that aim to ""control total coal consumption,"" and to increase the use of renewable energy supplies.China said it would reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels, and increase the share of non-fossil energy to around 20 percent. And to get there, it would start changing its policies today.As a practical matter, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have held steady for the past three years. China just halted the construction of 103 new coal-fired power plants, and its energy agency at the start of the year announced plans to pour more than $360 billion into renewable energy by the end of the decade.Wirth said that regarding coal-fired power plants, the Paris agreement creates diplomatic pressure for countries to move away from coal, but doesn’t mandate it.""Either China or the United States can build as many power plants as they want as long as they are offset in other sectors,"" he said. ""It was framed that way so as to give governments maximum flexibility to meet the goals they set for themselves.""Our rulingTrump said that the Paris agreement allows China ""to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" while the United States can’t. The White House offered no legal argument to back that up, and the text of the agreement fails to support it. The Paris agreement never mentions the word coal, and in Trump’s own words, it is nonbinding.It forces neither China nor the United States to do or not do anything.China’s voluntary plan to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions does allow emissions to rise until 2030, but it also moves the country away from reliance on coal, and the tangible results have been the cancellation of over 100 new coal-fired plants.Neither the law nor realities on the ground support Trump’s statement.We rate this claim False.

Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more?That’s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke’s.On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind.(Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke’s announcement. Two days after Abele’s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master’s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.)Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having ""penis envy,"" said Clarke’s legacies include reducing the number of deputies ""long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something.""Given that Clarke, who calls himself ""America’s sheriff,"" has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let’s see if Abele’s statement is on point.Sheriff’s role on crimeClarke’s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option.""But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff’s Office isn’t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff’s office ""plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency.""We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff’s office.That underscores an important point in weighing Abele’s claim: It’s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be.In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget.The numbers(Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.)With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff’s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin’s current governor, Republican Scott Walker.So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part.But the thrust of Abele’s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions.This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board. Again, we’re looking at the period before Abele took over as county executive.YearDeputies requested by sheriffDeputies recommended by county executiveDeputies authorized by County Board2003*6276252004*5735932005*Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021588588200653851951920074434434752008457457457200943943543520103933933932011328328328*Not availableThe figures, from the county budget office, are incomplete for the first three years. The number of deputies ultimately authorized by the County Board dropped by 37 by 2005, but the figures don’t show whether Clarke requested any reductions.In any case, 2005 was an important year.In that budget, Clarke requested and the County Board approved, changing 200 positions in the county jail from deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined.In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions.So, there were 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That’s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers.Our ratingAbele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff’s deputies from about 700 to about 300.The sheriff’s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That’s a total reduction of 321.Incomplete county records don’t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board. But in 2005, he requested and was granted a gradual turnover of 200 positions in the county jail from being deputies to lower-paid correctional officers.So, at least 200 of the 321 deputy reductions were specifically requested by Clarke, although those 200 deputies were jailers who were replaced by lower-paid correctional officers.We rate Abele’s statement Half True.

Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate.The national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them Mostly False. It called the statements ""bombastic"" and ""misleading."" The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios.PolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections.In a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim:""While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act),"" she said.Summary of PolitiFact’s findingsPolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact’s analysis and summarized it’s findings this way:The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition.Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition.States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.Here’s what’s wrong with the claimUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections.These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault.But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says.They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically.But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems.Problems prior to the Affordable Care ActThe blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage.These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist.None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions.For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance.""This is not something specific about sexual assault,"" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. ""But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future.""What repealing the Affordable Care Act could meanThe Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women.  Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge.The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition.What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act.""The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,"" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition.To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s ""health status."" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare.This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said.""Could"" is the key word.What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond.The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco.For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line.Sexual assault ""is the tip of the iceberg,"" Brindis said. ""There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid.""Our rulingVarious bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition.Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from ""would"" to ""could.""The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition.Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health.The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form.PolitiFact National rated this claim Mostly False.Following the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu’s claim Mostly False.MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: ""As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps. This bill represents a step backwards for Americans’ health in a number of ways.""Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

But that’s not the end of the story, by a long shot.The post originated on April 28 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked.TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""In this case, the site followed up its own story with another fake post the same day that said Nugent actually had been killed purposely by a ""white sympathizer"" named James Alan Whitland, under the alias Alex Hayne. This story also ended up on multiple sites.Whitland, the second post read, had been a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers and had assisted the man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016.

Nugent faced a year in jail and more than $1 million in fines over the waste of resources committed to the hoax, the site said, admitting that TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled, too.Of course, this was all fake, because the site is the outlet that made up the stories in the first place.Our contact with the supposed creator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a person who says his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, did not reply to our email seeking comment on the ruse.Nugent’s assistant, Linda Peterson, did reply to PolitiFact’s questions about the stories, sending a two-word email that read, ""Fake news.""It’s apparent Nugent was not killed, nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax.

201,,,,mostly-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/apr/25/brad-schneider/are-there-three-times-many-solar-energy-jobs-coal-/,"""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.""",,politifact,,"As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy.In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.""We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look.The sources of Schneider’s statisticsWhen we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement.The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016.The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one.So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why.Comparing data for energy jobs is trickyOne problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies.The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories.The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees ""engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low ""to the point of being fiction,"" said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council.""They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees,"" Headley said. ""They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working.""A better sourceWhile there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing.This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.)Here’s the full summary:This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote.Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use.She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal.""We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017,"" Sinclair said.  ""Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward.""Our rulingSchneider said, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.""Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Jerry Brown’s signature the bill will go into effect in November.The Golden State’s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country.Our researchAsked for evidence, Patterson’s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation. That map and its numbers, however, are outdated.A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees.It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California’s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation.Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California’s tax will trail Pennsylvania’s by 8 cents per gallon.""You won’t be No. 1, that’s for sure,"" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. ""Pennsylvania will still be the highest.""A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation’s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state.Based on current rates, California’s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts.We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California’s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii’s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said.Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline.This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state’s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which ""would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,"" Henchman said.Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not.Our rulingRepublican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California’s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the ""highest gas tax in the nation.""Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates.Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California’s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania’s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November.California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation.These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute.In the end, we rate Patterson’s claim False.UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline. The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California’s new legislation. It concluded ""Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin."" This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November. The state’s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California’s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation’s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would  be ""just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.""FALSE – The statement is not accurate.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations. They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders. Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders.Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offender as a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating.State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults.""When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,""Gallivan said at a news conference. ""Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison.

The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison.That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000 resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013.Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year.

Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court.More recent dataThere were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016.

It is a total increase of 4.1 percent.""",,politifact,,"Gov. Eric Greitens announced his recommended budget for fiscal year 2018 at a preschool for students with special needs in Nixa, Mo., instead of at the Capitol in Jefferson City. By speaking at a preschool, the new Republican governor said he was highlighting his commitment to public elementary and secondary education.Greitens described the difficult challenge he encountered making cuts to balance Missouri's ""broken budget."" The budget was broken, he said, by decreased tax revenues paid by special interests and by rising health care costs due to the Affordable Care Act. He promised K-12 classrooms would be protected from budget cuts.After the speech, Greitens took questions from the press. One reporter asked for clarification about elementary and secondary education funding and higher education funding.Greitens said: ""K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. And just to be specific, I’ll give you the exact numbers. Last year it was $5,914,000,000. This year is $5,951,000,000. We’re actually increasing spending for K-12 education. There will be more money from gaming funds, federal funds and state funds into K-12 education. It is a total increase of 4.1 percent.""We wanted to check into this claim, especially because cuts Greitens proposed to school transportation would cause some schools to dip into other accounts to transport kids to and from school.Education department numbersRight off the bat, Greitens is correct in saying that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would receive more total funding than in FY 2017 under his proposed FY 2018 budget. And the budgeted numbers he cited also check out.According to the governor's FY 2018 budget, last year the department received a total of $5,914,605,606 to fund public schools and other programs. This year Greitens recommends appropriating $5,950,859,927.But the governor said this was a 4.1 percent increase. The $36.3 million increase was actually an increase of 0.613 percent — just a little off.PolitiFact tried to get in contact with Greitens to understand where he came up with his 4.1 percent figure. His office referred us to the Department of Revenue, and his press secretary has not responded to our calls and emails.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021Throughout the speech, Greitens reiterated he was was increasing funds to K-12 education, but according to records available in the Office of Administration, he’s not increasing funds as much as previous years.Since unveiling his budget proposal, Greitens recommended that $11 million of $52 million received from a tobacco legal settlement be put toward K-12 school bus transportation. That increases the total amount for the department to $5.96 billion, or an 0.8 percent increase over the previous year.School transportation allocationEven with this additional money, Greitens’ proposal would still underfund school districts’ requests for reimbursement in transportation spending.To fully fund all of the school district's transportation requests, the department would need to dole out $280 million, said Roger Dorson, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The extra $11 million puts the total for transportation up to $80 million.School administrators were quick to point out when Greitens first unveiled his budget that school transportation funding decreased 34 percent from the previous year — or $36 million. To make up for this, administrators said they’d have to take money from classrooms or make changes to their local busing policy. By law, districts must transport students who live more than 3.5 miles from school, and the state will reimburse up to 75 percent of the total cost for the district.Additionally, the governor’s budget won’t fully fund the Foundation Formula by nearly $45 million. The formula determines how state money will be allocated to each district to ensure that every student, no matter where he or she lives, receives an adequate education. When the formula isn’t fully funded, schools must find other sources of money — or make cuts — to meet their financial needs, said Shari LaPage, the the chief budget officer of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.Greitens is giving $3.2 million more to the formula than the previous fiscal year, yet the amount still isn’t enough to allocate the amount of money to each school as required by law. Since 2014, the Foundation Formula hasn’t been fully funded.Our rulingGreitens said, ""K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent.""Greitens is right that his proposal for FY 2018 would allocate more money to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, but he is overstates the size of the increase. Even after including the money from the tobacco legal settlement, the increase would still be less than 1 percent. And the funding for core K-12 education falls short of the state’s own benchmark formula.We rate this claim Mostly False.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,https://www.facebook.com/EricGreitens/posts/10155039363264747,http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-schools-busing-cut-proposal-will-hurt-classrooms/article_84ac13ff-0a5e-5d07-b479-3666d17a5092.html,https://dese.mo.gov/faqs/school%20transportation",,"Education,State Budget,Missouri,Eric  Greitens",,,,,

Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, published a news release on Feb. 14 highlighting a letter she and 70 other congressional representatives signed asking Trump to include funding in his infrastructure investments to expand access to high-speed internet.""Roughly one-fourth of rural Missourians are unable to purchase high-speed internet which puts them at a disadvantage in everything from education to entertainment to health care,"" Hartzler said in the release.In a tweet from the next day, she expanded the spectrum of her assertion and said, ""Roughly one-fifth of Missourians are unable to purchase/access high-speed internet.""In an era of unceasing digitalization, access to the internet is only becoming a greater daily necessity.We wanted to fact check her numbers.An outdated reportWe reached out to Hartzler’s spokesman, Kyle Buckles, to find the source of this information. Buckles provided us with the Eighth Broadband Progress Report compiled by the Federal Communications Commission and released on Aug. 14, 2012. The report was also included in the news release, via hyperlink.  According to these 2012 numbers, Hartzler’s statement about rural residents is correct: some 24.2 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don't have access to high-speed internet. However, in her tweet she noted that one-fifth of all Missourians don’t have access to high-speed internet. This figure is inaccurate, according to the 2012 report, which says that 7.5 percent of the total state population doesn't have access to high-speed internet.The problem gets worse, though. The 2012 report provided by Buckles used an outdated benchmark internet speed. Measured in megabits per second, or mbps, the speed of an internet connection is a measurement of data transfer. The first number refers to the download speed, which is how fast your connection can retrieve data from the server, and the second number refers to the upload speed, which is how fast you can deliver data to the server.The benchmark number for high-speed internet used by the old FCC report is 4mbps/1mbps. The 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report has a benchmark of 25mbps/3mbps.The raised benchmark has drastically reframed the picture of access to high-speed internet in Missouri.Faster internetAccording to the 2016 report, 1,257,622 Missourians — or one-fifth of the state population — don’t have access to high-speed internet. (This is the same figure that Hartzler cited in her tweet, which leads us to believe that she gathered the data for her tweet from the most updated FCC report.)Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 21, 2021 in a postFacebook users can avoid “problems with your Facebook going against community standards” by changing your settings.By Daniel Funke • February 24, 2021Additionally, 61 percent, or 1,053,213 Missourians, who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet. That is a drastic increase from the 25 percent Hartzler cited in her release. It should also be noted that of those without access to high-speed internet, roughly 84 percent live in rural areas.Missouri ranks behind the national figures in both the percentage of the total population that lacks access to high-speed internet, 10 percent, and the percentage of rural the population without access, 39 percent.The importance of high-speedWhich brings us to the question: why does having high-speed internet matter?Heather Shoenberger, an assistant professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication who formerly worked on the Missouri Broadband Project, put it simply: ""Just think of all of the things you use internet for.""In addition to the rapid potential that continues to be unlocked by the internet and the internet of things, Shoenberger pointed to more mundane tasks like applying for a job.""You can’t get online to Monster(.com) and put your information in,"" she said. ""My parents actually have a small company and they often post to (job) boards that people supposedly have access to, (but) they’ve had some ads that have had zero response. And it’s not a result of the fact that people don’t need jobs in that area, because they most certainly do.""She continued, ""Everything we do almost is connected online now; almost everything is in the cloud and if you’re not part of that, you’re really sort of part of a group of people who are kept in the dark from a lot of information that’s out there. Anything from political information, to jobs, to the ability to search for a better price online, to compare car prices, to know if your car is a lemon.""But Shoenberger also said she wasn’t sure that expanding broadband infrastructure was the right solution, partly because of how much of Missouri’s farmland would have to be torn up to lay the broadband fiber, and partly because of the price.""Having access, that’s great, but then you have to have it at a price that people can pay for,"" she said. ""And I’m not certain that they can. I’m not certain that people in many of our communities can even afford a computer.""I think most people in these more poor communities are using cellphones for all of their internet accessing needs. That may be the best way of attacking the issues: just making the cellphone service really topnotch,"" she said.Our rulingHartzler said that one-fourth of Missourians who live in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet, but her numbers were based on an outdated FCC report from 2012 that used a much slower benchmark speed for internet.According to the most recent 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC, which uses a benchmark speed of 25mbps/3mbps for high-speed internet, nearly 61 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don’t have access to high-speed internet.Hartzler’s point is definitely correct, but her numbers are out of date and incorrect, which exacerbates the problem even more.On balance, we rate this claim Half True.","http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-infrastructure-plan-20170308-story.html,https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-12-90A1.pdf,https://hartzler.house.gov/taxonomy/story-type/blog/rural-access-high-speed-internet?utm_content=buffer1bcae&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer,https://twitter.com/RepHartzler/status/831882049753579520,https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-12-90A1.pdf,https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/24/facebook-posts/dont-waste-your-time-you-cant-block-facebooks-comm/,https://mobroadbandnow.com/",,"Technology,Missouri,Vicky Hartzler",,,,,

Tammy Baldwin greeted the Obamacare replacement bill -- she calls it ""Trumpcare"" -- with a sharp retort.This was the Wisconsin Democrat’s tweet on March 8, 2017, two days after the unveiling of the the House GOP bill:#ReadtheBill & you’ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.To be sure, the top executives at five major insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth, Anthem and Humana -- already make millions, with each CEO earning between $10.3 million and $17.3 million in 2015, according to the latest figures.Could the CEOs make millions more as a result of the GOP bill?There would be an opportunity for that: A proposed tax break in the bill connected to executive compensation would be worth millions of dollars to the health insurers.But the tax break would go to corporations, not personally to the executives.And Baldwin’s claim assumes the corporations would give millions of dollars in raises to the executives.A tax deduction changeBaldwin’s attack centers on a provision of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump, that would change a tax deduction:Currently, Obamacare limits to $500,000 the amount of an individual executive's compensation that a health insurance company can deduct as a business expense.The aim, as U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., has noted was to prevent health insurers from passing along profits they made via Obamacare to their executives, and then deducting the cost of those raises on the company’s taxes.The GOP replacement bill would repeal the $500,000 limit, generally making the cap $1 million, the same amount that applies to other types of businesses. In other words, health insurance companies could increase their tax deduction.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 15, 2021 in a post on Facebook“If you make $50,000/year, $36 of your taxes goes to food stamps. $4,000 goes to corporate subsidies.”By Madison Czopek • February 19, 2021The upshot for the federal government, as estimated by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: $400 million in lost tax revenue over 10 years.The effectsSo, as Baldwin suggests, the GOP proposal would allow health insurers to claim a greater tax deduction for the pay it gives its top executives.A CNN/Money news report said that of the $73 million paid to the CEOs of the five major insurers in 2015, only $2.5 million was deductible under Obamacare tax laws, but more than $70 million of it would be deductible under the Republican legislation.But there are other important facts to consider:It’s misleading to say that executives would ""personally"" benefit from the change, given that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals.The health insurance companies would have more of a financial incentive, in terms of tax deductions, to give raises to their executives.

He was echoing reports from ""multiple news outlets.""""Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,"" said deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on March 5. ""There are multiple news outlets that have reported this.""At one point in the segment, Sanders specifically named the New York Times and BBC as news outlets that have covered the wiretapping allegations. Show host Martha Raddatz pushed back and said Trump started this issue with his specific tweet.ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosSanders repeated her point: ""I hardly say he started this when there were multiple news reports prior to that.""If the basis of Trump's comment is media reports, he doesn't have a case. A White House spokesperson sent PolitiFact five articles from the BBC, HeatStreet, the New York Times, the National Review and a transcript from Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier as evidence of Sanders’ claim.Before we get into those, it’s worth noting that many news outlets have suggested Trump’s remark was inspired by a March 3 post on Breitbart News. The post was not included by Trump’s team as backup, but the Breitbart article links to some of the other reports.The Breitbart article followed up on comments by Mark Levin on a March 2 segment of his conservative radio show. During the show, Levin claimed Obama’s administration used ""police state"" tactics in the fall to watch over Trump’s team.Trump sent his tweet early March 4. As of March 5, he had still not provided evidence.""How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" Trump wrote.How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017The Breitbart article recapped 10 news events of the 2016 campaign that laid the foundation for Obama’s administration to ""eavesdrop on the Trump campaign."" Among the events included as an example is the Wikileaks release of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which the Clinton campaign used to blame ""Trump and the Russians.The Breitbart article also mentions two requests under the the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which grants a court the authority to grant (or deny) warrants for electronic surveillance. The reporting about FISA requests is taken from a Nov. 7, 2016, report from the conservative-leaning website called HeatStreet. HeatStreet published an article, it said, based on two unnamed sources. ""The FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counterintelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia,"" reads a line from the HeatStreet piece.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021The story says the FISA warrant was in relation to an investigation to the ""Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia’s Alfa Bank."" Other reports about this FISA requests come from the BBC and the Guardian. (The White House did not send the Guardian over as evidence.) Importantly, these sources do not back up Trump’s accusation that Obama himself ordered the wiretap as part of political sabotage.On Jan. 12, the BBC reported that lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice filed applications to the court that handles intelligence matters related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA.""A lawyer — outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case — told me that three of Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry,"" wrote Paul Wood, a British journalists who wrote the article in first person. The article did not say anything about Trump Tower.Six months earlier, the Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a warrant to monitor members of Trump’s teams interactions with Russia from the FISA court in June. The story was light on the details. It said the June application was turned down by the court, and briefly mentioned a report that the FBI was granted a warrant in October, but that has yet to be confirmed.Trump’s team also sent over two articles from the New York Times. These articles are about intelligence probes related to Trump associates and Russian officials.The first article, published on Jan. 12, reported that ""American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of then- President-elect Trump.""At one point, the article indicates that intelligence reports stemming from the intercepts were given to Obama’s administration.""One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House,"" it reads.The other article from Jan. 12 is about the Obama’s administration expanding the powers of the National Security Agency through new rules that relaxed limits on ""collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.""Trump’s team also cited an article from the National Review as well as a March 3 Fox News interview between host Bret Baier and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The National Review article repeats the same information from HeatStreet. Baier asked Ryan about the report on FISA requests, which Ryan said he had not heard about. To be clear, that isn’t an example of Fox independently confirming the HeatStreet report.It’s worth noting that Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said on NBC’s Meet the Press he was not aware of any wiretaps that Trump alleged. And Obama, through a spokesman, has denied wiretapping Trump Tower. And Obama officials have also said a president cannot unilaterally order a wiretap. Our rulingSanders said ""multiple news outlets"" have reported that Obama ordered wiretaps on Trump, including high-profile sources such as the New York Times and BBC.Trump’s team cited multiple reports to back up this claim, but it’s clear only one is at the root of Trump’s claim: a November 2016 blog post based on anonymous sources that has not been corroborated by independent U.S. journalists. Trump's spokeswoman made it sound as if Trump was merely following a well-documented string of reports, but that is not the case. A few of the reports allude to the FBI requesting permission from FISA to eavesdrop on Trump’s associates, but none (minus the anonymously sourced website) definitively said the probes centered on Trump himself or came directly from Obama.We rate this claim False.

It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trump’s tweet.""On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion,"" the Gateway Pundit website reads. ""On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office!""The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury.But, experts say, people shouldn’t read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne.""Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels,"" Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us.""Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns,"" he said.The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check.Looking at the debt numbersTrump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is ""debts held by the public,"" which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else.On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion.

But experts say it’s likely to shoot back up any day.""I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about,"" said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel.""This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future?""Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, ""both matters that he has not affected one iota.""Added Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters: ""No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all. There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number.""Donald Marron,  Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute, speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obama’s administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department.By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion.Our rulingTrump tweeted, ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion.""Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is ""down"" after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise.This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure.We rate this claim Mostly False.Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title.  Share the Facts   Politifact    4 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion.""

Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the state’s pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits.He hasn’t, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the state’s mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions.""The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005,"" Rauner wrote in Springfield’s Capitol newspaper, ""costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.""For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois’ current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assembly’s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.We decided to dig in to Rauner’s claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate.Borrowed timeA 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group.Featured Fact-checkIllinois Republican Partystated on February 5, 2021 in social media posts“Pritzker’s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities” puts prisoners, politicians and college students ahead of “individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.”By Kiannah Sepeda-Miller • February 12, 2021The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays.The SEC settlement document underscores Rauner’s claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds’ condition. ""Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions,"" it reads, ""the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the State’s creditworthiness.""Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauner’s claim was supported by the facts.In an email, Hertz said, ""The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line.""According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, ""the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045.""Our rulingIn an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate.The General Assembly’s own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions.

Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a YouTube video uploaded Feb. 1, 2017.As Sanfelippo spoke, a graphic behind him caught our attention.It claimed that ""Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release.""Repeat offendersTo check the claim, we turned first to an official report on recidivism published by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in September 2016. It tracks whether inmates are sentenced for a new crime after they are released from prison for an earlier offense.The report shows recidivism trends covering more than 156,000 offenders who were released from the Wisconsin correctional system between 1990 and 2013, Corrections Secretary Jon E. Litscher wrote in an introduction.Quick takeaway: Since the early 1990s, the percentage of inmates who are convicted of a new crime within three years of getting out of prison has fallen steadily.In the category of ""violent"" criminals, the Department of Corrections looked at those convicted of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, other sexual assault, simple assault, and other violent offenses including intimidation, illegal abortion, extortion, cruelty toward a child or wife and hit-and-run driving with bodily injury.Violent crimes do not include aggravated burglary or burglary, DOC spokesman Tristan Cook told us. The standards come from the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) Performance-Based Measures System.For those who committed violent crimes -- the group Sanfelippo is interested in -- 27.2% were considered recidivists, according to the latest state report.So does that mean Sanfelippo is way off target by saying ""over 39% return to prison?""Not necessarily.There’s a wrinkle here related to the definition of ""recidivism.""Under the definition used in the report, recidivism means those who are convicted and sentenced for a new crime.That leaves out a whole category of offenders who return to prison without being convicted of a new crime. Typically they land in prison when their probation, parole or extended supervision is revoked by the state.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021When you factor in those cases, the rate was 39.7% in the most recent figures, according to the state Department of Corrections. It’s that calculation that Sanfelippo points to in backing up his claim.The state calls that the ""reincarceration rate."" It’s a commonly used measurement in incarceration research.And Sanfelippo’s phrasing in the video squares with that data.Another factorBut there is one issue with his approach.Sanfelippo portrays these repeat violent offenders as ""terrorizing our neighborhoods,"" but many who are sent back due to parole violations and related matters have done something that does not warrant a new criminal charge.Violent offenders are returned quite frequently for technical violations, in part because they are under more stringent supervision due to the serious nature of their offenses, said Thomas LeBel, a criminal justice expert at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.A Journal Sentinel investigation published in 2015 found the process that sends violators back behind bars relies largely on the judgment of individual parole agents, which can vary widely.Among the reincarcerated, more than half were imprisoned when their probation, parole or extended supervision was revoked, with no new conviction and sentencing, Corrections Department statistics show.In those types of cases, there was suspected criminal activity in about 70% of cases involving some 3,000 ex-offenders sent back to prison without being convicted of new crimes in 2015, Corrections Department statistics show.But technical violations are a factor too. They can include things such as accepting a job without permission, missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer, or leaving their home counties, according to a study by WISDOM, a statewide group of faith leaders and activists dedicated to prison reform.Indeed, some can wind up back in prison even if acquitted of charges in court. In February 2017, the Journal Sentinel wrote about Damien Payne, a Milwaukee man on state supervision after release from prison in 2010.Payne was found not guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of carrying a concealed weapon, but still was sent to prison for more than three years.

But it’s far from his only criticism of the former president’s trademark health care law.Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017.""This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases,"" the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states.""This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren’t statistics, these are real lives,"" he said. ""These are real families facing huge premium increases.""Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, ""hurting people right now"" and attributable to Obamacare?Numbers are on the markThe basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second.The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016.As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend.Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017.The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas.Premiums affect many peopleRyan’s description of the law as ""hurting people right now"" is a bit subjective, but it’s clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing ""families facing huge premium increases.""Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that’s $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy.That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That’s more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare?The final hurdle for Ryan’s claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now — in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs.This year’s 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan.For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation’s largest businesses — an indicator of overall health insurance costs — will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers.Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended — reinsurance and risk corridors.Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low.Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders.Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market.They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren’t available to redistribute.Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace.This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others.Our ratingRyan said soaring Obamacare premiums are ""hurting people right now,"" including one state with an increase of 116 percent.The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren’t eligible for subsidies.And while we can’t exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up.The missing nuance in Ryan’s claim is that it doesn’t acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn’t have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we’ll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care.For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means.Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, she’s spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety.It was no surprise Speier spoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign.But we found a similar statistic on the organization’s website: ""Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence."" The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19.The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015.To examine Speier’s claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting.We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19.That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speier’s claim of ""more than seven"" per day.These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides.

All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents.Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction.The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website.

This stop on his multi-state ""thank-you tour"" was mostly a campaign-style rally, but there was some policy, too.  Midway into his remarks, Trump said:""We’re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. This includes a massive tax cut for the middle-class and middle-class families from Wisconsin, too.""We’re also going to lower our business tax rate so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That’s what we want. We’re going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we’re going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And when we finish, we’ll be one of the lower taxed, one of the lower.""Whether the president-elect keeps his promises on taxes will be something to be determined by PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter, which will be launched in 2017.But we can answer now whether America’s business tax rate is the highest in the world.Top U.S. rate: 35%The corporate income tax rates in the United States range from 15 to 35 percent. And that 35 percent top rate -- at least as a ""statutory"" rate (more on that below) -- is relatively high.The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes the top corporate tax rates for the 35 countries that belong to its organization, which includes most advanced, industrialized nations.The U.S’ top rate of 35 percent ranks first, just ahead of France, 34.4 percent; Belgium, 33 percent; and Australia and Mexico, 30 percent. On the low end: Switzerland, 8.5 percent; Ireland, 12.5 percent; Latvia and Canada, 15 percent; and Germany, 15.8 percent.Sometimes references are made to a combined corporate tax rate, which includes federal and state corporate taxes; the U.S.’ combined rate is 38.9 percent. But Trump was referring to the 35 percent federal rate, the one he vows to reduce.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 15, 2021 in a post on Facebook“If you make $50,000/year, $36 of your taxes goes to food stamps. $4,000 goes to corporate subsidies.”By Madison Czopek • February 19, 2021There are, however, two clarifying points to make.Other nations, and what is paidTo back Trump’s statement, his campaign cited a Forbes article that noted the United States has the highest corporate rate among industrialized nations. But Trump didn’t limit his statement to industrialized nations.The accounting firm PwC tracks the top federal corporate tax rates for 155 countries. That list shows five other countries that also have a top rate of 35 percent: Argentina, Chad, Congo, Malta and Zambia.And there are two countries with higher top corporate tax rates: United Arab Emirates, 55 percent; and Puerto Rico, 39 percent.It also needs to be understood that America’s 35 percent top rate is the statutory rate -- before deductions -- but U.S. companies aren’t actually taxed at that rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits.Indeed, a March 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax.And a May 2016 paper by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing found U.S. multinational firms have used tax planning to generate effective tax rates ""that are far lower than the statutory rate, and often in the single digits.""Our ratingTrump said America’s federal business tax rate is the highest ""in the world.""The top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the world’s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent.Also, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/077f53a2-c756-458f-b4f3-4f872d820085","http://live.jsonline.com/Event/Live_Coverage_Donald_Trump_in_West_Allis,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/09/j-jacobs/did-jfk-answer-vince-lombardis-call-spring-green-b/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/kanye-west/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mike-pence/,https://www.c-span.org/video/?420078-1/presidentelect-trump-vice-presidentelect-pence-deliver-remarks-west-allis-wisconsin&start=2423,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/nov/10/donald-trumps-campaign-promises-first-100-days/,https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/oct/14/guide-trumps-promises-businesses-and-families/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/nov/17/coming-2017-trump-o-meter/,http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf,http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204,https://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm,http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-misleads-about-tax-bill-breakdown/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2015/03/25/the-truth-about-corporate-tax-rates/#22f462be20a5,http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/tax/corporate-tax/worldwide-tax-summaries.html,http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/uk/taxsummaries/wwts.nsf/ID/Corporate-income-tax-(CIT)-rates,http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf,http://equitablegrowth.org/report/profit-shifting-and-u-s-corporate-tax-policy-reform/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/077f53a2-c756-458f-b4f3-4f872d820085",,"Corporations,Foreign Policy,Taxes,Wisconsin,Donald Trump",,,,,
218,,,,true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/dec/02/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-spending-increases/,"""We spend less than 2 percent more every year. That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers.""",,politifact,,"The Cato Institute recently issued fiscal policy report cards to America’s governors, and the libertarian think tank gave Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a B for his ""impressive tax cutting."" But Cato also warned New York state’s spending is rising briskly.Since then Cuomo has boasted about the state’s restrained spending since he took office in January 2011. Holding the line on spending let Albany pass on the savings to taxpayers, he said.  ""We spend less than 2 percent more every year,"" Cuomo said. ""That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers. No other governor has reduced spending as much as I have, Democrat or Republican. George Pataki, Nelson Rockefeller, Republicans. I spend less.""So who’s right? Is the state’s spending rising briskly, or has it been restrained? We checked if Cuomo posted the smallest spending increases since Rockefeller.Tracking the spendingThe state has kept consistent data on spending since Nelson Rockefeller’s days as governor.The state Department of Budget says the data dates back about 57 years. Data before then is unconfirmed or doesn’t exist.Rockefeller held office from 1959 to 1973, when he left to become President Gerald Ford’s vice president. Malcolm Wilson, his lieutenant governor, served out the rest of his term until 1974.Annual spending increases averaged 11.1 percent during the four terms of Rockefeller and Wilson.Here’s how the other governors, with legislative support, spent since then:Hugh L. Carey increased spending by an average of 8.7 percent each year during his two terms in office from 1975 to 1982.Mario M. Cuomo increased spending by an average of 6.9 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1983 to 1994.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021George E. Pataki increased spending by an average of 5.1 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1995 to 2006.Eliot L. Spitzer took office in 2007 but remained governor only until 2008 when scandal prompted him to resign. David Paterson, his lieutenant governor, took over for the remainder of the term ending in 2010. Spending increased by an average of 3.8 percent annually between 2007 and 2010.Cuomo’s recordCuomo has approached budgeting differently than other governors. Instead of using anticipated revenue to craft a spending plan, he’s imposed an annual 2 percent cap on state spending. This year’s budget marked the sixth consecutive year of spending increases at or lower than 2 percent.In Cuomo’s six years in office, spending has increased an average of 1.4 percent each year, when adjusted to exclude federal emergency aid for disasters like Hurricane Sandy recovery.Without adjusting for federal aid, average annual spending under Cuomo rose 2.2 percent, still less than his predecessors dating back to Rockefeller.So what’s Cato talking about?The Cato Institute’s report in October says the state’s general fund ""increased more than 8 percent in 2016 and is expected to increase more than 5 percent in 2017."" The report’s numbers are correct, but they do not show the whole picture of the state’s spending. The Cato report refers only to the state’s general fund, not total state spending.New York state over the decades has created hundreds of special revenue accounts that exist outside the general fund. The general fund is the largest but only makes up about 60 percent of state spending. The state has cut spending in the other accounts to come to the 2 percent or less increases during Cuomo’s time in office, according to the Department of Budget.Our rulingAt an event in Fishkill last month, Cuomo said, ""We spend less than 2 percent more every year. That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers.""It’s true that Cuomo has enacted the lowest spending increases since state government started tracking that data. No comparable data exists before the Rockefeller administration.We rate this claim as True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2dc30eaa-f63d-4b26-a8ac-fd0c1a6c634d","https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2016#full,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/,https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/executive/eBudget1617/fy1617littlebook/BriefingBook.pdf,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-and-legislative-leaders-announce-agreement-2016-2017-state-budget,https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2016#full,http://publications.budget.ny.gov/budgetFP/FY2017FP.pdf,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2dc30eaa-f63d-4b26-a8ac-fd0c1a6c634d",,"Economy,State Budget,New York,Andrew Cuomo",,,,,

Rattner asked Priebus on the Nov. 14 show.""Well, there's not that many, the conflicts aren't as great as you're outlining,"" Priebus responded. ""President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That's not extreme, that's exactly what is in the House today.""Is Priebus right? We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trump’s proposals.Trump’s immigration policiesOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because ""immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening.""Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism.""When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats,"" Trump said June 13, 2016.In December 2015, Trump called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif.In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would ""suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.""Congress policiesWe reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trump’s immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own.A bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of ""covered aliens,"" to ensure they are not a threat to national security.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021The bill defines a ""covered alien"" as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011.Individuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said.A refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 ""appropriate Congressional Committees"" that the person is not a national security threat.The American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January.Another House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are ""not reasonably satisfied"" that the refugee does not pose a security threat.Under that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she ""has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee"" and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location ""is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants"" in the area is too high.Thirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. It’s been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.This summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to ""suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees.""The bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries.Forty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security.Babin’s bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies.Our rulingPriebus said, ""President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting.""Trump's policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees.As for the restrictions, a bill passed in the House that is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate.Two other House bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugees have not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined. We rate Priebus’ statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f40b918e-faf3-4f51-8678-fc939998891f","http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/priebus-donald-trump-gets-that-he-serves-you-808279619641,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/26/how-trump-plans-build-wall-along-us-mexico-border/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/aug/30/what-donald-trump-has-said-about-deporting-undocum/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/trump-nearly-180000-illegal-immigrants-have-crimin/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/19/donald-trump/trump-says-us-admits-100000-permanent-immigrants-a/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-500-pe/,https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-addresses-terrorism-immigration-and-national-security,https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/nov/09/politifact-sheet-donald-trumps-immigration-plan/.,https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/immigration/,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038,/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/,http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=2&vote=00004,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4078,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5816,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f40b918e-faf3-4f51-8678-fc939998891f",,"Immigration,National,Homeland Security,Reince Priebus",,,,,

On the opposite side: ""Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein.""We wanted to know more about the story behind this claim, so we reached out to the Ohio Republican Party.Though the flier literally reads, ""Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military,"" Ohio’s GOP spokesperson Brittany Warner told PolitiFact Ohio, ""Under no circumstances is this written to imply that Mr. Weinstein has no faith in the service of our men and women in uniform.""The candidate’s military background makes the words in this ad all the more puzzling. Weinstein, 34, is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. He is an Air Force Reserve captain currently separated from active duty.His father, his brother, and his wife are also graduates.Confused? Turns out, ""no faith in our military"" is a paraphrase of Weinstein’s stance in a 2004 lawsuit against the Air Force Academy. The lawsuit asked for renewed enforcement of the constitutional separation of church and state on the military campus.The lawsuit was filed by Weinstein’s father, Mikey Weinstein, a former Air Force officer. Four cadets at the Air Force Academy, including the candidate Casey Weinstein, joined the suit, and claimed that the Air Force Academy imposed a hostile environment by pushing Christianity on the non-Christians in their ranks.  One of the incidents detailed in the suit was an Air Force Academy-promoted screening of Mel Gibson’s film, The Passion of the Christ. (Weinstein is Jewish, and Gibson’s movie has been criticized for portraying Jews as enthusiastic participants in the crucifixion of Jesus.) The movie screening was not the plaintiffs’ only example of pervasive religious activities occurring on duty.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 26, 2021 in a viral video""In March 2020 the United States deployed 30,000 troops to Europe to ... free child-trafficked children and arrest deep state cabal members.""By Madison Czopek • January 29, 2021We contacted Mikey Weinstein, who wanted to be clear that his participation in this fact-check is not an endorsement of his son nor an opinion on the race. The elder Weinstein is the founder and president of the nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, dedicated to restoring ""the obliterated wall separating church and state in the most technologically lethal organization ever created by humankind: the United States armed forces."" He is a 1977 graduate of the Air Force Academy who went on to serve for ten years in the Judge Advocate General Corps (as a ""JAG"" officer), and as legal counsel to President Ronald Reagan's administration in the White House. Mikey Weinstein pointed out that the campaign flier gets the ""sued our soldiers"" claim wrong on two points. First, it implies that the suit targeted individuals for their individual acts, which is not accurate. A lawsuit filed against a military branch and its highest civil servant -- in this case, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force -- is an action against the institution, not the individual.Secondly, the servicemembers of the U.S. Air Force are referred to as airmen and airwomen, not soldiers. ""Soldiers"" applies to members of the Army.Mikey Weinstein said that his organization has represented over 48,000 service members across every branch of the military and any faith (or lack thereof).As for the lawsuit against the U.S. Air Force, it was dismissed by a federal judge after Weinstein and his co-plaintiffs graduated, losing their legal standing against the institution. An internal Air Force investigation later substantiated the claims brought by the Weinsteins’ lawsuit and prompted the issuance of new religious tolerance policies.Our rulingA GOP-funded campaign flier stated, ""Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military,"" and, ""When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein.""The mailer twists many facts about a lawsuit to present Weinstein, an Air Force reservist from a military family, as hostile to the armed forces.There is an element of truth in that Weinstein did sue the Air Force Academy, asserting that the institution unconstitutionally promoted the evangelization of Christianity by its leadership and cadets on duty. His lawsuit did not target fellow ""soldiers,"" but the institution itself (also, Air Force members are not called ""soldiers""). The flier further capitalizes on the two possible interpretations suggested by the phrase ""no faith in our military."" A cursory read of the flier could easily leave voters with the impression that Weinstein was critical of the armed forces.For manipulating the real narrative, we rate the claims in the mailer Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4264508e-222a-4309-9db5-ccf92962ff8b","https://www.ncronline.org/news/art-media/decade-later-passion-still-raises-questions-anti-semitism,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/troops-werent-sent-europe-free-trafficked-children/,https://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/,http://www.salon.com/2014/09/17/air_forces_mind_boggling_violation_members_forced_to_swear_religious_allegiance/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/22/AR2005062200598.html,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4264508e-222a-4309-9db5-ccf92962ff8b",,"Ohio,Military,Religion,Ohio Republican Party",,,,,

But those nudges didn’t single out cowboy hats and boots.Starnes said in his Oct. 28, 2016, opinion piece posted by Fox News that he learned of the advice about hats, boots and other no-no’s from a story  posted the same day by the College Fix, a conservative student-written website.Its story opened: ""Leave your cowboy boots and Hawaiian leis at home this Halloween unless you want to hear from University of Texas-Austin administrators.""Like other accounts including a subsequent Houston Chronicle news story and a blog post on the Austin American-Statesman website, the story included a web link to what's described as the relevant checklist for UT students.An introduction to that checklist, titled ""Costume & Theme Selection,"" states: ""You don’t have bad intentions, but your social theme or costume idea could have a negative impact. Themes and costumes may intentionally or unintentionally appropriate another culture or experience.""Hunting for mentions of hats and boots, we saw that at the bottom of the second page, under ""Harmful Themes and Costumes,"" the document lists:--Any time you paint or tint your skin in an attempt to appear to be a different skin tone, race, or culture (e.g., Blackface)--Generalized representation/stereotypes of Asian cultures--’Cowboys and Indians’/anything ‘Squaw’ or generalized depiction of an indigenous person or peoplesThe list of discouraged themes or costumes goes on to specify eight other questionable themes.

Bird responded to our inquiry by saying the pages highlighted in news accounts fail to note a preceding page in the presentation. Bird then pointed us to UT’s post of a full copy of the guidelines showing that a three-paragraph statement on the first page says the ""voluntary guidelines"" are intended ""to educate students about costume and party theme selection.""That opening section continues: ""UT Austin does not place limits on students' freedom of expression. We do not regulate their speech or enforce costume guidelines as rules. Our philosophy is to educate students and remind them that they are accountable to each other and that their actions can negatively impact other members of the university community.""We offer these voluntary guidelines in that spirit,"" the section closes.We asked Bird if the ""cowboy/Indian"" mention might reasonably be read to deter students from donning cowboy boots or hats on Halloween. Negative, Bird said by phone, in part because nothing there or elsewhere in the guidelines  explicitly counsel against simply wearing such hats or boots.For a student perspective, we reached Will Deer, a senior who told us he’s close to ending a one-year term as the student president of the University of Texas Interfraternity Council, which oversees 29 fraternity chapters.By phone, Deer said he personally sees the guidelines as mandates that help ensure student events are culturally appropriate. ""That’s because I am a representative for the entire IFC community,"" he said.But by his read, Deer said, the ""cowboys and Indians"" portion of the guidelines speaks solely to party themes the university would advise against. Commentator Starnes' claim specific to hats or boots, Deer said, ""kind of took that out of context. It’s incorrect.""""The culture here in Texas is cowboy boots and cowboy hats,"" Deer said.Our rulingStarnes wrote: ""Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween.""Voluntary student guidelines distributed before Halloween 2016 listed ""cowboys and Indians"" among potentially harmful themes or costumes to avoid. However, the administration’s advice didn’t stretch to counseling students not to wear cowboy boots or hats.We rate this claim False.FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

""They do such a great job, it’s incredible and it’s an honor.""He professed fondness for Cleveland, and said, ""In 17 days we are going to win the great state of Ohio, and we are going to win the White House. Together we’re going to deliver real change that once again puts America first.""Trump continued, ""As an example, this used to be a great plant. Thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries. Not going to happen anymore, we’re going to tell you why, but not going to happen anymore.""We wanted to know whether one of the prime convention sites for Northeast Ohio was formerly a hoppin’ manufacturing plant. Here’s what history told us.The I-X Center was originally built in 1942 for the U.S. Defense Department during World War II, according to Case Western Reserve University’s Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. It became known as the Cleveland Tank Plant or the Cleveland Bomber plant, and under General Motors it employed 15,000 people who built parts for the B-29 bomber.The plant closed when the war ended, and the city of Cleveland retained it as an exhibition hall and sales center before leasing it to National Terminals for the storage of soybeans.The facility resumed wartime service in 1950, when GM’s Cadillac Division chose it as the manufacturing site for Army tanks destined for battle in Korea. GM immediately employed 6,000 workers, but after two years of production, the Army rejected the Cadillac Tank Plant’s output due to a problem with the gun mechanism. After a redesign of the gun sight, the plant produced Walker Bulldog tanks used in the Korean war between 1953 and 1955. Production ceased on the Walker Bulldogs in 1959.Cadillac won a new military contract in 1960 to build the self-propelled T195 and T196 howitzer tanks and M114 armored personnel carriers.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post“Trump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 4, 2021 In 1965, GM shifted the management of the Cleveland Tank Plant to its Allison Division. It made M551 16-ton Sheridan tanks up to 1972, when the contract was completed and Congress decided against its renewal. The U.S. Defense Department sold the plant to the Park Corporation of Charleston, W.Va., in 1977, which opened it in 1985 as the I-X Center, calling it the ""largest single-building exhibition facility in the world."" Now, it appears to be the United States’ ninth-largest.Nowhere in the building’s history does it appear that manufacturing was transferred overseas. Military contracts kept the site active for its first 30 years, interrupted by a period in which it stored soybeans. In 1985 it became an exhibition hall, the function it serves today.About an hour after this fact-check was published, the Trump campaign responded in disagreement with our findings.""Mr. Trump used the history of the I-X center as a great manufacturing facility as an introduction to his hour long speech where he talked about issues impacting jobs in Northeast Ohio, and PolitiFact does its readers and its brand a disservice by running such misleading headlines and false ratings,"" said Seth Unger, the Trump campaign's Ohio spokesman. Our rulingTrump said that Cleveland’s I-X center was an example of a once-great plant, but ""thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries.""Trump’s lamentation of outsourcing isn’t historically accurate. The I-X Center was alternately called the Cleveland Tank Plant, and GM’s Cadillac and Allison Divisions built military bombers, tanks and personnel carriers there between 1942 and 1972. Production stopped when a military contract expired and was not renewed. Once acquired by the Park Corporation, it opened as an exhibition space in 1985 and has operated as one ever since.We rate Trump’s statement False.Editor's note: This fact-check was updated shortly after publication to include the Trump campaign's response.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b6973bb-4d55-4b41-9d84-92394ece37b9","/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/blog-posting/no-there-wasnt-attempted-assassination-against-tru/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b6973bb-4d55-4b41-9d84-92394ece37b9",,"Ohio,Corrections and Updates,Jobs,Donald Trump",,,,,

""Here's another example: He was asked if he would defend our allies.

NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.To back Clinton’s claim, her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy. Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.""Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have 'fulfilled their obligations to us,' "" the New York Times reported.According to a transcript of the interview with the New York Times, Trump also said many NATO members ""aren’t paying their bills.""Reporter David E.

Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.""Our commitment to come to our allies' defense -- and theirs to ours -- isn't in return for any payment,"" Daalder said. ""It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty.""NATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares, said Jeff Rathke, senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. And to be clear, funds are paid to NATO, not to the United States.Beyond the common funding of certain capabilities, each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense, said Rathke, who served on NATO’s International Staff from 2009 to 2011. Allies are to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, though many are not meeting the guideline.Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack, ""it would be the end of NATO.""""This would be a very damaging blow to U.S. national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world,"" Benitez said.Our rulingClinton said when Trump was asked if he would defend our allies, ""He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.""Trump has raised questions about other NATO nations not paying their fair share for defense.

A country that we have a good relationship with, that can help us in a lot of ways -- not just with oil, but in military situations such as what’s going on in a number of places in the Middle East.""Having said that, though, this regime has embraced Wahhabism. Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam that they have paid to export throughout the world.""This Wahhabism is the principle force -- going from Pakistan to Ethiopia to Mali and now to Kosovo -- that is turning perfectly moderate Muslim peoples, peace-loving peoples, into people who adopt an extreme religious approach where the women are all covered up and they are basically taught that Americans are the devil.""How can we allow a country to be perceived as a friend -- across the board, without any questions -- when they are doing such a terrible thing?""So, has a U.S. ally ""paid to export throughout the world"" Wahhabism -- ""an extreme form of Islam"" that basically teaches ""Americans are the devil""?Saudi is an allyAs Feingold intimated, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, even if the relationship is sometimes uneasy.Saudi Arabia has been a close ally in the Middle East since World War II, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in April 2016, even as differences on issues such as Iran have strained the relationship.In testimony before a congressional committee in May 2016, a Middle East scholar from the Brookings Institution led off by saying: ""On the one hand, the Saudi government is a close partner of the United States on counterterrorism. On the other hand, Saudi support for an array of preachers and non-government organizations contributes to an overall climate of radicalization, making it far harder to counter violent extremism.""Politico Magazine was more blunt. In 2014, it named Saudi Arabia No. 2 on its list of America’s 25 most awkward allies, saying: ""No country buys more U.S. weapons than the autocratic, oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, and no country — with its obscurantist interpretation of Islam, medieval punishments and harsh treatment of women — makes for a more embarrassing U.S. ally.""It paid to export WahhabismEstimates on the dollar amount vary, but there is widespread agreement that Saudi Arabia pays to export Wahhabism.UCLA history professor James Gelvin, whose research specialties include Social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, told us it’s been estimated that since the 1960s, Saudi Arabia has spent $100 billion spreading Wahhabism through schools, mosques, the media and other means.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Saudi expert David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, told us he’s not convinced the amount is that high but there’s no question billions have been spent.And an August 2016 news article in the New York Times, in which three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries were interviewed, stated there has been ""lavish spending on religious outreach for half a century, estimated in the tens of billions of dollars.""Wahhabism is extremeThe Times article said Wahhabism, the Islam taught in and by Saudi Arabia, is named after an 18th-century cleric who founded it and is a ""literalist, ultraconservative form of Sunni Islam"" whose adherents ""often denigrate other Islamic sects as well as Christians and Jews.""Westerners typically understand Wahhabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran, as PolitiFact National noted in rating as Pants on Fire a claim that a school President Barack Obama attended in Indonesia taught Wahhabism. Indeed, the Islamic State adheres to strict, literal interpretations of the Koran and Islamic teachings that are rooted in Wahhabism, which is the dominant faith in Saudi Arabia, as PunditFact has reported.William McCants, director of the Brookings Institution’s Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World, told us Wahhabism ""is one of the most intolerant forms of Islam."" And in Gelvin’s view, Wahhabism ""has squeezed out other, more moderate forms of Islam and in many places in the Middle East, it is the only game in town.""Americans are the devil?Thie final part of Feingold’s claim is more debatable.""I would agree with everything except the ‘Americans are the devil,’"" Islamic specialist Khaleel Mohammed, a religious studies professor San Diego State University, told us. ""Having studied there, I must say I never found any insinuation as such. But, I would agree that Wahhabism promotes ‘occidentophobia’ (anti-Western sentiments among Muslims).""Weinberg, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called that part of Feingold’s claim debatable and other experts use different characterizations.The Brookings Institution’s McCants told us that ""official Saudi textbooks teach that Christians are seeking to destroy the religion and must be hated as a consequence.""Calling Feingold’s devil reference ""a bit of an exaggeration,"" Gelvin said Wahhabism conflicts with American values such as equal rights for women and popular sovereignty, ""and acts as the gateway drug for many who go on to become jihadis.""Our ratingFeingold says Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has ""paid to export throughout the world"" Wahhabism -- ""an extreme form of Islam"" that basically teaches ""Americans are the devil.""Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, albeit sometimes with strained relations.

Help end the Hillary-Feingold corruption by demanding Senator Feingold’s emails be released immediately.""So, the claim is that ""just like Clinton,"" Feingold had a ""run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund"" -- the ""Feingold Foundation"" -- while ""plotting"" to run for the Senate seat he lost to Johnson in 2010.Then there’s the reference to State Department emails.Let’s look at this in two parts.‘Personal slush fund’The ""personal slush fund"" allegation, refers to Progressives United -- a political action committee Feingold founded after he lost his try for a fourth term in the Senate.In June 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice revealed that the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC. For instance, Feingold's longtime chief of staff was paid $317,823 by the PAC and a related nonprofit from February 2011 until July 2013, when she left to take a job joining Feingold at the U.S. State Department. And Feingold received $77,000 from the two groups.Moreover, $42,609 was spent to buy hundreds of copies of a book he authored (though Feingold did not receive royalties for those books).The Wisconsin GOP acknowledged to us that it is referring to the PAC as the ""Feingold Foundation"" and that there isn’t such a foundation.Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation, an international health and development charity, has been controversial for very different reasons.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, claimed that 80 percent of the foundation’s money goes to overhead, PolitiFact National’s rating was False. But the figure was only 10 to 20 percent.The Clinton Foundation has been criticized more for potential conflicts of interest, not its spending. It has accepted millions in foreign donations, including from countries with business in front of the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.Donors were able to get access to Clinton. For example, Clinton had been reluctant to grant a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain after he made requests through official channels. But a short-notice meeting was granted to the prince, whose government gave more than $50,000 to the Clintons’ charity, after a longtime Clinton aide who helped create the foundation interceded.‘Plotting another run’As for the ad’s allegation that Feingold was operating a personal slush fund while ""plotting"" his 2016 run for the Senate, the state GOP told us that Feingold is ""just like Hillary Clinton"" in that there are questions surrounding his time at the State Department.But once again, the circumstances involving Feingold and Clinton are quite different.The party alleges that Feingold violated federal law by engaging in political activities as a federal employee -- that is, planning his Senate run while he worked as a special envoy for the African Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.A conservative website says the State Department has agreed to its requests to provide emails Feingold exchanged with top Senate Democrats and two of his former aides, although it’s not known whether the release will come before the Nov. 8, 2016 election.Feingold has denied any wrongdoing.In contrast, Clinton has faced much more than partisan allegations over her State Department emails.It has been well established that Clinton exclusively used a private email address while serving as secretary of state. Because she didn’t use the government system, the department didn’t have her emails on hand when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see them.So in 2014, Clinton’s lawyers combed through the private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said were about personal matters.Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim incorrect. There was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, but her email setup exposed her to hacking.Our ratingThe Wisconsin GOP says that ""just like"" Clinton, Feingold had a ""run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. the Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate.""There is no Feingold Foundation. The ""personal slush fund"" reference is to a political action committee established by Feingold that spent significant sums that benefited Feingold -- for salaries and consulting fees to Feingold and his former aides, and to buy copies of a book he wrote.But the Clinton Foundation got into controversy not over its spending, but for potential conflicts of interest, given that it accepted donations from foreign countries that had business before Clinton as secretary of state.And while Clinton clearly broke State Department rules by setting up a private email system, nothing has been established beyond allegations that Feingold did anything improper with emails during his employment by the State Department.For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.","https://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-johnson/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q49Y_FDzZ2Y,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/russ-feingold/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/,https://www.wisgop.org/end-the-hillary-feingold-corruption/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/republican-party-wisconsin/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9962fa26-c63a-4fcd-a9c9-2010b28c7281,http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/russ-feingolds-pac-funded-salaries-for-former-staffers-himself-b99518602z1-307322531.html,https://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/01/fact-checking-clinton-foundation-controversy/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/post-about-keystone-pipeline-falsely-claims-buffet/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/reince-priebus/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/republican-national-committee-republican/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-false-claim-80-clinton-foundation-c/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/20/reince-priebus/hillary-clinton-took-money-kings-four-countries-go/,https://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/01/fact-checking-clinton-foundation-controversy/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/emails-reveal-how-foundation-donors-got-access-to-clinton-and-her-close-aides-at-state-dept/2016/08/22/345b5200-6882-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html,http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/30/feingold-johnson-build-support/89587234/,http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/feingold-delivers-last-speech-as-us-envoy-senate-bid-expected-b99451043z1-293894861.html,http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/09/30/report-state-department-expedite-feingold-emails/91348028/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/19/politifact-sheet-hillary-clintons-email-controvers/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/",,"Campaign Finance,Ethics,Foreign Policy,Wisconsin,Republican Party of Wisconsin",,,,,

At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant.The next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview.

Then last year, a report said waste from the process was still coming into the state.Lawmakers grilled Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos at a water quality hearing in Albany. He contradicted the report.""No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State, and those who perpetrated that are wrong,"" Seggos said at the hearing. ""There's no high volume hydraulic fracturing going on in New York. It's going on in other states. No waste from those other states is coming into New York.""Environmental advocates, however, point to information from Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection that indicates trucks carry fracking waste from the Keystone State to landfills in upstate New York.So do upstate landfills accept fracking waste?The Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania confirmed that landfills in New York State took in fracking waste. We looked into what kinds of waste comes into the state, and which ones do not.Waste brought into New YorkFracking is different from traditional gas drilling. Instead of drilling a well straight into the ground, a company first drills vertically, then directs the well horizontally. The drillers then blast porous rock with fluid to extract natural gas.Regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation block any waste more than 80 percent liquid from being dumped into landfills. That prevents liquid fracking waste, like flowback water, from being brought into the state for disposal. But any solid waste that may have come in contact with fracking liquids is permitted under current regulations.Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows three New York State landfills this year accepted waste from high volume hydraulic-fractured drilling. According to a database from the Pennsylvania agency, the Chemung County Landfill took more than 15,000 tons of waste, including what’s listed as drill cuttings, synthetic liner materials, servicing fluid, soil contaminated by oil- and gas-related spills, and ""other oil and gas wastes."" Hakes C&D Landfill in Steuben County took in about 1,900 tons of drill cuttings. Hyland Facility Association in Allegany County took 550 tons of soil contaminated by oil- and gas- related spills.The definitions of this waste from the state of Pennsylvania are vague. We spoke with Scott Perry from the Pennsylvania environmental agency for a better understanding.Perry said any soil contaminated by an oil- or gas-related spill more often than not comes in contact with flowback water - a mixture of fluids and chemicals used during the fracking process.""The most commonly spilled material is flowback water,"" Perry said. ""Drilling fluids and diesel are probably the next most common.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021Companies are not required to detail what they include in the ""other oil and gas wastes"" category. Perry said it’s considered a catch-all for waste that does not fit any other description. He said it could mean anything from the packaging used to store chemicals before they are used for fracking to broken equipment.Synthetic liner materials are thick mats or liners used to prevent chemicals and other waste from leaking into the ground. Perry said any residue is washed from the liners before they’re transported for disposal.Servicing fluid is used to maintain the wells and can include a water/oil-based mud and foam.All three New York State facilities that received waste this year are owned by Casella, a landfill operator. When we contacted one of the landfills, they said they do perform analytics on the waste as it’s brought to the facility, but a message to Casella for details was not returned.We also reached out to both companies that operate the wells where the waste came from, but neither responded to our request for more information.As recently as last year, one facility in Syracuse was still accepting fluid that the Pennsylvania agency says includes brine from fracking. But no records indicate any New York State facility has accepted the fluids this year. Landfills accepted flowback waste from fracking as recently as 2013.The state's responseWe contacted the Department of Environmental Conservation about the contradiction between Seggos's statement and the Pennsylvania database. In a statement, the department said any drilling waste brought into the state was strictly regulated. In the same statement, the department said waste from fracking was not allowed in the state.""Given recent public statements from advocates, it is important to set the record straight regarding the disposal and use of high volume hydraulic fracturing waste,"" said Kevin Frazier from the Department of Environmental Conservation. ""Under Gov. Cuomo’s leadership, New York State banned high volume hydraulic fracturing and prohibits the use and disposal of any high volume hydraulic fracturing waste or fluids, including brines, anywhere in the state.""""DEC also strictly regulates the State’s four landfills that currently accept drill cuttings from drilling operations. These landfills employ radiation detectors to ensure that no regulated radioactive materials are received by the facility. In addition, DEC staff provide on-site oversight and inspection to ensure operations are in compliance with state regulations.""The DEC said it is ""in the process of strengthening these already robust regulations."" A public review and comment period about the proposed revisions ended Sept. 13, Frazier said.When asked to clarify the confusion over banning some waste while accepting others, the DEC did not offer a clear response.Our rulingDuring a hearing on water quality, Basil Seggos, the New York State commissioner for environmental conservation, said ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State.""Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicates waste from fracking is transported from Pennsylvania’s wells to three landfills in New York.

It turns out he was.In 1973, Trump, as a 27-year-old, was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management. It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. By all accounts, including his own, Trump was a hands-on president and very active in managing the day-to-day business operations.That year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race.""The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,"" the complaint reads.Black people, the government found, were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent.In one instance, a black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18, 1972, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot.The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government said the company’s comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said ""C"" for ""colored"" to every application submitted by a person of color.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit.Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But he did offer an explanation in the debate.""As far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued,"" Trump said. ""We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.""Indeed, both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle. Trump claimed victory, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: ""In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt""However, under the agreement, Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements.It’s also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly -- ""north of 98 percent,"" Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law, previously told PolitiFact. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt.""That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence"" against Trump, Schwemm said.Our rulingClinton said that Trump ""started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans.""Both parts of the statement are carefully worded and accurate.

Tammy Duckworth revived and added specificity to a charge that dogged U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk throughout his successful 2010 U.S. Senate campaign.""This is the man who knows so much about national security. He’s been wrong about every issue on national security he’s ever been involved in,"" Duckworth said. ""And who, by the way, claims all this based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times.""Those who followed Kirk’s campaign against then-Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias likely recall that Kirk in 2010 issued clarifications and apologies related to his military claims on more than one occasion. But ""at least 10?""The Duckworth campaign provided a list of Kirk’s alleged infractions. It says Kirk falsely claimed he: won the Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award, performed combat duty in Kosovo, was shot at in Afghanistan and while flying over Iraq, was ""deployed"" to Afghanistan, took part in Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, was the only member of Congress as of 2005 who was a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, commanded the Pentagon’s war room and did not violate military policy about campaigning while on duty.We decided to look into the allegations.The backgroundKirk served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1989 to 2013 and frequently mentioned his military experience during the years he spent as U.S. representative for Illinois’ 10th Congressional District from 2001-11. There’s nothing unusual about that. As Chicago Sun-Times columnist Carol Marin noted in a June 2, 2010, column, ""In American politics, military service is like a platinum credit card.""Kirk might have kept his platinum card status had Terry Welch, an Afghanistan veteran and blogger at Nitpicker.com, not looked into a claim in 2005 by U.S. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, that Kirk was the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress. (Kirk became part of this narrative only as a side player. Schmidt brought up Kirk’s service record to refute a claim by her opponent that, if elected, he would be the first Iraq War vet in Congress.)Kirk’s official House website at the time said Kirk ""is the only member of Congress to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom…""In a series of posts in 2005 (here, here and here), Welch painstakingly dissected Kirk’s claim of Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran status. Kirk’s office eventually changed the wording, though Welch noted that it took 50 days for it to do so.""While we applaud the service of Mark Kirk, his service occurred before the March 19, 2003, start date of the mission, according to the Bush administration itself,"" Welch wrote in this post.The episode, though clumsily handled by Kirk’s office, faded in the years that followed. But when Kirk in 2010 became the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Barack Obama, it became a crack in a dam that soon would unleash a flood of reporting on similar incidents in which Kirk inaccurately described his military career.The questions started anew in May 2010, when Kirk’s opponent, then-Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, challenged Kirk’s claim to have been named Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year in 1999. This led to an admission by Kirk that he had not won the award, but was part of a unit that won a different honor.""Commander Danny Hernandez, a Navy spokesman, said Thursday the individual 1999 Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year was given to another reservist and not to Kirk,"" the Chicago Tribune reported.Also around that time, Kirk changed his website to remove the word ""combat"" from his description of military service in Kosovo.On June 3, Kirk faced new allegations of embellishment when he visited the Chicago Tribune editorial board. From the Tribune’s report:In a new disclosure, Kirk acknowledged that his campaign's promotion of him coming under fire while flying aboard an intelligence reconnaissance plane in Iraq may not be correct because there is no record of whether his aircraft was being fired upon.Kirk also acknowledged a constituent letter sent out by his North Shore congressional district office last year that described him as a member of Operation Desert Storm, though he did not participate in that effort.""I am sorry, absolutely,"" Kirk said. ""You should speak with utter precision. You should stand on the documented military record. In public discourse, for high office, you should make sure that there is a degree of complete rigorous precession.""If you’re keeping score, that’s six of the 10.On June 13, the Tribune ran a story challenging Kirk’s claim that he had been ""deployed"" to Afghanistan when really he had been there for short training stints. The article again quoted Navy spokesman Commander Danny Hernandez. ""A deployment is a deployment and annual training is annual training,"" Hernandez said.That’s No. 7.On July 8, 2010, PolitiFact summarized more inaccuracies in Kirk’s telling of his military background. These found Kirk claiming, incorrectly, that he had served in Operation Desert Storm and that he ""command(ed) the war room in the Pentagon."" PolitiFact mentioned those and other incidents while testing the veracity of a claim by Kirk’s opponent that Kirk had been disciplined for ""violat(ing) Pentagon rules...for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 18, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden didn’t act in response to the emergency in Texas.By Samantha Putterman • February 19, 2021PolitiFact ruled the statement True, which brought more trouble for Kirk when his office persisted in claiming that he never had violated those rules.That’s 8 and 9.But Duckworth specified 10, and among those was a claim that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan. This is based on a Huffington Post article published June 4, 2010, that claimed Kirk had given conflicting accounts of whether or not he was shot at in Kandahar.In January 2009, Kirk had told the suburban Lake County News Sun that he ""never got shot at"" during recent service in Afghanistan.In January 2010, Kirk was asked on a Chicago Sun-Times questionnaire about the ""wildest thing"" he had ever done in his career. He responded, ""Last year, I was with a Dutch armor unit in Kandahar, getting shot at.""The original HuffPo article inferred that Kirk gave conflicting reports about the same incident. But Kirk’s campaign spokesman said in an addendum to the article that that was not correct:Eric Elk, a spokesman for Kirk, said that there is no contradiction in the statements. The Congressman, he says, was referring to two different instances in which he was in Kandahar.""He there was there in December 2008/Jan 2009 and then December 2009/Jan 2010,"" said Elk.That would be the last of the new accusations pertaining to Kirk’s military career. Kirk weathered the storm and made numerous statements of contrition, then went on to defeat Giannoulias in a narrow victory in November.Our rulingDuckworth said Kirk claims military and defense expertise ""based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times.""There is no disputing that Kirk spent the summer of 2010 explaining and apologizing for misstatements in describing his military experience.The Duckworth campaign listed these 10 examples when we asked:Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year AwardTaking fire while flying over IraqServing combat duty in KosovoBeing shot at in AfghanistanBeing ""deployed"" to AfghanistanTaking part in Operation Desert StormParticipating in Operation Iraqi FreedomClaimed to be the only member of Congress who served in Operation Iraqi FreedomClaimed to command the Pentagon’s war roomClaimed he had not violated Pentagon policy about campaigning while on dutyThe fourth claim on this list, that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan, is in dispute. The original source for that claim contains an update indicating Kirk described two separate incidents. Kirk’s current campaign spokesman, Kevin Artl, reiterated that explanation when contacted for this article.The groundwork on the other nine claims was done six years ago or longer, sometimes by multiple media outlets. If you follow the links included above, you’ll see that the coverage at times creates a confusing patchwork of sourcing that makes it difficult to put all this into a smooth timeline.You’ll also see a long pattern -- albeit one that appears to have ended after the summer of 2010 -- of ambiguous language and conflicting claims throughout Mark Kirk’s frequent pronouncements on his military activity.We rate Duckworth’s claim Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8059518-2eac-4135-b133-dc20c19ae331","http://www.pressreader.com/usa/chicago-sun-times/20100630/281908769404951,https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1473/103/1600/kirkdistorts1.jpg,https://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2005/08/jeans-lie-outs-fellow-republican.html,https://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2005/08/its-time-for-mark-kirk-to-apologize.html,https://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_archive.html,https://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2005/08/bullshit.html,http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/05/gop-senate-candidate-kirk-overstated-military-award.html,http://www.pressreader.com/usa/chicago-sun-times/20100602/281878704609718,http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/06/kirk-apologizes-acknowledges-more-errors-in-military-resume.html,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-13/news/ct-met-senate-kirk-military-record_1_mark-kirk-congressman-kirk-treasurer-giannoulias,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/08/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-says-kirk-mixed-politics-militar/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-joe-biden-wasnt-silent-or-inactive-texas-freeze/,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/04/mark-kirk-may-have-missta_n_601192.html,http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionResults.aspx?ID=pdeeGST8d2w%3d,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/04/mark-kirk-may-have-missta_n_601192.html,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8059518-2eac-4135-b133-dc20c19ae331",,"Military,Illinois,Tammy Duckworth",,,,,

After additional training, they were deployed to Iraq in March and April of 2006.While in Iraq, Mowrer served as an intelligence analyst with the ""Ironman Battalion,"" which was tasked with convoy security on the western region of the Iraqi theater of operations.In January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense announced an extension of that deployment from 12 months in Iraq to 16 months as part of the military's ""surge.""The unit, which was in fact the longest-deployed unit of the Iraq War according to a congressional resolution, returned to Iowa in July and August of 2007, and Mowrer ended his service honorably in 2009 without being redeployed. He returned to Iraq as a civilian analyst and adviser to the commander of U.S. forces later that year.According to military records, Mowrer was mobilized from October 2005 through August 2007 — almost 23 months.

These are individuals encountered or identified by (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.""",,politifact,,"A number of the statements Donald Trump made in his high-profile immigration speech in Phoenix were ones we’d checked before. But one was new to us.""Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities,"" Trump said. ""These are individuals encountered or identified by (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.""As it turns out, the numbers are a lot more complicated than Trump indicated. Let’s take a closer look.Where does the 300,000 figure come from?Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Trump, directed us to Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies. (Officially, the center’s website says the group’s research has convinced many of its staff to be ""animated by a ‘low-immigration, pro-immigrant’ vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted."")Vaughan said that the 300,000 estimate comes from three distinct numbers.• In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a cumulative 86,288 criminal aliens from custody pending removal proceedings. (That number has actually fallen year by year, from 36,007 to 30,558 to 19,723.) This number was announced by Sarah R. Saldana, ICE’s director, at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on April 28, 2016. According to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, these 86,288 criminal aliens collectively were convicted of more than 231,000 crimes.• From Jan 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015, state and local law enforcement agencies turned down 18,646 requests by ICE to hold deportable aliens arrested for non-immigration-related crimes until ICE could take them into custody. This figure was verified by ICE during an investigation by the Texas Tribune.• Vaughan has calculated that between 2013 and 2015, ICE officers, due to prosecutorial discretion, ""let off more than 200,000 criminal aliens they encountered, instead of initiating deportation. Most of these were in local custody at the time. The encounters were hands-on, usually interviews at a jail – not just reviewing a list or getting a hit in a database.""Vaughan said this number comes from internal ICE reports on enforcement activity -- the Weekly Report on Departures and Detention. The original documents are cited in the footnotes of Vaughan’s work here, here and here.If you put these three figures together, they add up to roughly 300,000.How solid is the 300,000 number?On purely numerical grounds, the experts we checked with didn’t express much concern about the first two categories, which collectively add up to about 105,000 individuals. The 200,000 figure is more controversial, however.Part of the concern stems from relying heavily on Vaughan’s calculations of ICE data, made necessary in part because the numbers from ICE are often opaque, hard to obtain, or both.Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University who has studied the issue, said that Vaughn offers ""no evidence about whether there was actually probable cause under the law to arrest most of those who were not arrested. The report treats every encounter by an ICE agent as one in which we know there could have been an arrest. But as we know from many studies in lots of policing contexts, many police encounters end without an arrest because there is no basis for an arrest to be made.""Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Other experts also urged caution about the number. ""We cannot confirm that ICE has released 300,000 criminal immigrants and not placed them in removal proceedings,"" said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes that well-managed immigration brings ""benefits to immigrants and their families, communities of origin and destination, and sending and receiving countries.""Meanwhile, another concern stems from differences of opinion about what ""prosecutorial discretion"" means.The Obama administration has enacted a policy of ""prosecutorial discretion"" to prioritize removal proceedings. The guidelines place a lower priority for removal on those who came to the United States before age 16, are currently below age 30, have resided in the U.S. consistently for five years, are in school or have graduated or are serving in the military or have been honorably discharged -- and have ""not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses.""To supporters, this simply makes sense: In a world of limited resources, ICE should be putting the most dangerous or disruptive deportable individuals at the top of the list.To critics, however, this policy is a smokescreen for failing to uphold the law.Current law, Vaughan said, states that all aliens who are here illegally ""are potentially subject to deportation regardless of whether they have other criminal convictions."" Prioritization hasn’t been driven by resource constraints or public-safety considerations, she said, but rather ""by political considerations.""There’s a related question of whether it’s reasonable to call the Obama policy ""political correctness,"" but that’s an opinion, so we’ll set that aside.At the very least, we can say that there is a professional dispute about whether the 200,000 figure is accurate. And since this category accounts for two-thirds of the total number referenced by Trump, this at least raises a question about whether his 300,000 figure is credible.How accurately did Trump describe Vaughan’s statistic?Beyond the question of whether the number is accurate, experts told us that Trump cut a few corners in how he described the number in his speech.• The three categories are a mixture of different statistics, and there may be some overlap. Vaughan acknowledges this, though she suspects the impact would be small. ""There may be a few duplicates in the mix, if an individual was encountered or released more than once during the time period, but these are not enough to throw off the estimate by a lot,"" she said.• Trump is loose with his terminology. He uses the term ""criminal aliens,"" even though the widely accepted definition of that term refers only to the first category of the three -- the one that counted 86,288 over the three-year period. As for the third category -- the cases where a local law enforcement agency declined to hold a deportable individual in custody for ICE -- it counts arrests, not convictions, making the term ""criminal alien"" inappropriate in at least some instances. Cox cited research showing that nearly one-third of all noncitizens taken into federal custody this way between 2008 and 2012 had no criminal convictions.• It’s an overreach to lay all of this at the Obama administration’s feet. For starters, Saldana in her congressional testimony said that between one-third and two-thirds of the criminal releases -- the first category -- were required by law, not by ICE’s choice, depending on the year. ""These folks would also have to be released by ICE even if Trump were president, unless the agency was planning to flout court orders and ignore the detention rules written into law by Congress,"" Cox said.One problem, as we’ve noted previously, is that in some cases, the individual’s home country -- notably Cuba and Vietnam -- refused to accept them. We found that in fiscal year 2013, home country refusal led to the release of 3,746 people. (Critics, including Trump, say the U.S. should work harder to punish those recalcitrant countries.)Meanwhile, the primary actor in the third category are state and local law enforcement agencies, not the Obama administration, meaning it is ""flatly incorrect to say that these are ‘criminal aliens’ that the Obama administration has allowed . . .  to return back into United States communities,"" Cox said. In fact, he added, ""ICE has been extremely unhappy about this resistance and has worked hard to get local governments to comply with detainer requests, so it is misleading to say ICE is ‘responsible’ for any such releases."" (Vaughan countered that these releases ""could have been prevented if the Obama administration had taken action against"" sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that do not routinely turn over deportable aliens in their custody. ""Instead, the administration has facilitated them,"" she said.)Our rulingTrump said that ""since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.""One can make a reasonably strong -- though not foolproof -- case for 100,000. But immigration professions are divided over how credible the next 200,000 is. Meanwhile, Trump’s description of the number in his speech is not entirely accurate.

We need to be top line on the polls,"" Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11.This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached 18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact.We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race.None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnson’s average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average.Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question.We ran Johnson’s theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasn’t been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021""It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said. … You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible,"" Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT.Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldn’t necessarily be in his favor.""(Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think ‘I don’t really like either of these folks.’ And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, ‘Oh, there’s another option,"" Berinsky said.When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, ""As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree.""Since Johnson’s likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens.It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent article by the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538’s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992.Our rulingJohnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent.Many polls do include Johnson’s name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible.

""Then, realizing how detrimental her position could be to her election prospects, Rosen reversed course and said she would have opposed it.""Rosen’s position isn’t exactly a complete flip-flop. Her initial support for the deal wasn’t as clear or as strongly stated as the blog says.We decided to weigh her statements on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes.Republicans have sought to tie Democrats (including in Nevada) to the 2015 diplomatic arrangement with Iran, which aims to extend the time it takes for the country to make a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.Rosen, a former Henderson synagogue leader and political newcomer, has addressed the deal publicly on just a handful of occasions.She made her first remarks about the deal in an interview (audio) with the Las Vegas Sun and a PolitiFact Nevada reporter in April, saying Obama ""made the best deal"" he could.""Just being an ordinary citizen, I do believe that he made the best deal that he thought he could at the time or he probably wouldn't have made it,"" she said at the time. ""That being said, it doesn't mean that we don't watch everything they do. It doesn't mean that we don't watch where money gets invested into Iran. Where they're spending their money. It doesn't mean that we don't keep watching them. It doesn't mean we don't keep improving on the agreement where we have to or imposing sanctions where we have to.Featured Fact-checkHarry Reidstated on February 19, 2010 in a television interview with Las Vegas political analyst Jon Ralston""We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is.""By Louis Jacobson • February 22, 2010A month later, Rosen again addressed the deal, but this time she struck a different tone. She told political reporter Jon Ralston that she would have voted against the deal had she been in Congress at the time.She said it said didn’t reflect a change in position.""I guess as I have had a chance to think about and clarify it, it hasn’t changed,"" she said. ""I did say I want to hold their feet to the fire, I want to look at where the money goes, and I don’t want a nuclearized Iran.""PolitiFact reached out to the Rosen campaign, which provided a statement from the candidate saying that her position on the deal has been ""clear and consistent.""To help prove the point, the campaign also provided an email exchange from late March to early April between Rosen campaign manager David Furr and a staff member at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee over an Israel policy paper including her position on the Iran deal.The paper reflects what Rosen said to Ralston in May.""If Jacky had been in Congress when the vote on the Iran deal had occurred, she would have opposed the deal,"" the paper reads. ""But now that it has been agreed, the United States must demand that Iran abide by the agreement completely, and any cheating or subversion of the agreement should be dealt with swiftly.""A few caveats do apply — this paper wasn’t previously available publicly, so there would be no way for voters to know her position. Rosen also doesn’t list any foreign policy positions (or any issues, for that matter) on her website.Our rulingRosen has only been quoted a handful of times on the Iran deal. In April, she expressed measured support of the deal (without using the word ""support""), saying she believed it was the best deal Obama could have reached, and that it could be improved. Her view the next month was more articulated. She said she would have voted against it as a member of Congress.Because she has partially changed her position, we rate Rosen’s position as Half Flip.","https://www.nrcc.org/2016/08/15/new-revelations-highlight-jacky-rosens-iran-deal-flip-flop/,https://www.nrcc.org/2016/08/15/new-revelations-highlight-jacky-rosens-iran-deal-flip-flop/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kczrgWP2CzY,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/08/politifact-sheet-6-things-know-about-iran-nuclear-/,https://soundcloud.com/riley-snyder-914544736/jacky-rosen-iran,http://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/apr/20/congressional-candidate-jacky-rosen-talks-issues-f/,http://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/apr/20/congressional-candidate-jacky-rosen-talks-issues-f/,/personalities/harry-reid/,/factchecks/2010/feb/23/harry-reid/reid-calls-nuclear-waste-issue-solved/,http://watch.knpb.org/video/2365753672/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2oNAgpKFunVaoPG0euVGL4QfUliEgVc-42y56TB23g/edit?usp=sharing,http://www.rosenfornevada.com/",,"Nevada,Nuclear,Jacky Rosen",,,,,

He recounted how it was the ""worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812"" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited ""Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help.""Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: ""By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.""Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, ""We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush."" He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, ""since Sept. 11.""Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using ""abbreviated language.""But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to ""radical Islamic extremism"" is murkier in others.The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of ""violent jihadist attacks"" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification.That’s because strict definitions like ""hate crime"" or ""terrorist attack"" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — ""questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation,"" said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America.That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role.2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting  On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard.Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine.2002 Beltway snipersIn October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24.The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over ""the continued oppression of black people.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence.2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shootingOn July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle.A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor.In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits ""into the terrorist mold"" while the New America Foundation lists it as a ""violent jihadist attack,"" because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions.2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attackIn March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians.He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree,"" he wrote in one letter.UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006.Terrorist attacks that were unsuccessful or with unknown motivesTwo other infamous attacks don’t exactly fit Giuliani’s criteria, but are worth noting.The 2001 anthrax scare, which occurred shortly after 9/11, is the worst biological attack in U.S. history and a major terrorism case, according to the FBI. Five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured during the attacks. In 2008, the FBI was about to bring charges against Dr. Bruce Ivins, but the microbiologist committed suicide before they were filed.The 2001 shoe bomber, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid, attempted to light explosives on an American Airlines flight before he was subdued.In addition to these attacks, the New America Foundation has documented a handful of thwarted terrorist plots before Obama’s presidency.Our rulingMoments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, ""Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States.""Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments.Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them.We rate his claim False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9f7f5498-8a3a-4ee1-8be2-70eb05f12c2f","http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2752536.1471309646!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/front-rudy-0815.jpg,http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_obama_twitter_forgets_911_islamic_terrori.html,https://youtu.be/5AGeel-VeeY?t=8m1s,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/08/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-there-were-no-domestic-attacks-durin/,https://www.nbcnews.com/id/34779020/ns/politics/t/giuliani-no-terror-attacks-us-under-bush/#.V7NKa5MrJAY,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/rudy-giuliani-blames-9-11-forget-gaffe-abbreviated-language-article-1.2753356,https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/09/25/lax.shooting.asylum/,https://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/04/12/airport.shooting/,https://web.archive.org/web/20070711215404/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.malvo04dec04,0,3960951.story,http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/14/nation/na-snipers14,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/23/us/virginia-justices-set-death-sentence-in-washington-sniper-case.html,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/beltway-snipers,http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Six-shot-one-killed-at-Seattle-Jewish-federation-1210235.php,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/29/us/29seattle.html,http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/08/02/seattle-jewish-center-shooting-suspect-charged-with-murder-hate-crime.html,http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Emergency/PlansOEM/SHIVA/2014-04-23_Terrorism.pdf,http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html,https://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/25/schuster.column/index.html,http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/07/nation/na-plow7,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/us/defendant-offers-details-of-jeep-attack-at-university.html,https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/amerithrax-or-anthrax-investigation,http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/terror-plots.html",,"National,Terrorism,Rudy Giuliani",,,,,

""He is the founder of ISIS. He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.""Trump has been making similar comments for several months, and he repeated his latest talking point in an interview with Republican radio host Hugh Hewitt the day after his Broward speech.In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious interpretation of his assertion — that Obama and Clinton ""created the vacuum"" in the region and thus ""lost the peace"" to ISIS — Trump rejected that formulation, sticking with the most literal version of ""founder"" and ""co-founder.""""No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS,"" Trump told Hewitt. ""I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.""Hewitt pushed back, saying, ""But he’s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He’s trying to kill them.""Trump dismissed that again, saying, ""I don’t care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that, that was the founding of ISIS, okay?""And hours after the Hewitt interview aired, Trump tripled down on the attack in a speech to the National Association of Homebuilders in Miami Beach once again accusing them of being the founder and cofounder of ISIS.Trump was already incorrect when he said Clinton ""invented"" ISIS with her ""stupid policies,"" as he did a few weeks ago.Now he’s taking it a step further with the ""co-founded"" attack.Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton ""co-founded"" ISIS.The creation of ISISExperts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected.But Trump’s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance.For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state.ISIS has used several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014.The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in 2010.Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.But you could also argue Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup.The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS.As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign has previously pointed to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. While Clinton does bear some responsibility for the Iraq war that gave ISIS an opening, she isn’t solely responsible: The vast majority of senators — from both parties — joined her in supporting the intervention advocated by Bush.""So yes, Hillary's vote for President Bush's misguided policy to build democracy in Iraq directly assisted the Republican decision that opened the door to the radicalization of Iraq and destabilization of the Levant,"" said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told us in July when Trump attacked Clinton. ""Bush's destruction of the Iraq Army and state is the single-most important decision that led to the expansion of al-Qaida into the region and later emergence of ISIS.""Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and that did not include an agreement to leave a large force behind.Trump’s campaign has also pointed to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence for allowing ISIS to grow. As secretary of state in 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria and said Assad needed to ""get out of the way.""""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion.""In recent years, the United States has targeted ISIS militarily, with some signs of progress and some setbacks. After an ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels, Obama said that destroying the group is his ""top priority."" (For what it’s worth, Clinton herself was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels but was overruled by Obama. She also advocated for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011.)As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it’s possible to argue that the administration’s withdrawing from Iraq, its lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the power of ISIS.These concerns track those we’ve heard from foreign-policy experts. However, this more limited and defensible critique of Clinton’s record is what Hewitt offered Trump on his radio show, and the candidate forcefully rejected it out of hand — twice.Our rulingTrump said Obama ""founded ISIS. I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.""There’s a credible critique that Obama’s and Clinton’s foreign-policy and military decisions helped create a space in which ISIS could operate and expand. But Trump explicitly rejected this formulation, saying he literally means Obama is ""the founder of ISIS"" and Clinton is the ""cofounder.""In reality, the founder of ISIS was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama has said destroying ISIS is his ""top priority.""All this makes Trump’s statement a ridiculous characterization.

We continue to rate her statement Mostly False.Californians will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Proposition 64, a much-debated measure on the state’s ballot.U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, who opposes Prop 64, says a green light for the initiative could strip away advertising rules and dramatically change what’s seen on TV.Prop 64 ""allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers,"" Feinstein said on July 12, 2016, in a No On Prop. 64 campaign press release.We know Prop 64 would allow Californians to legally smoke pot in their homes, yards and possibly in designated shops where it’s sold and regulated.But would it also lead to marijuana ads on ""prime time"" TV? Or is Feinstein blowing smoke? We decided to fact-check the senator’s statement.Half-baked claim?Prop 64 is backed by Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democratic Party. Recreational marijuana is already legal in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. Several states in addition to California are set to decide on legalizing pot in November.Feinstein’s office did not expand on her statement. Instead, it referred us to the No On Prop. 64 campaign.The campaign pointed us to Prop 64’s chapter on advertising and marketing restrictions, specifically Section 26151.It states: ""Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print and digital communications shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data.""Wayne Johnson, spokesman for No On Prop. 64, said the 71.6 percent threshold is so low that only a few shows, such as Saturday morning cartoons, would be prohibited from airing marijuana ads.""It’s a ridiculous standard,"" Johnson said. ""It only applies to the tiniest handful of shows.""In this photo taken on Thursday, May 26, 2016, Sarah Seiter, curator of the exhibit ""Altered State: Marijuana in California"" handles a cannabis leaf with gloved hands at the Oakland Museum in Oakland, Calif.  Ben Margot / APClaim ignores federal lawTV and legal experts say Feinstein’s statement ignores federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal drug and prohibits advertising it on television.""If Prop 64 passes, nothing will change in terms of what radio and television stations can legally broadcast,"" said Joe Berry, president of the California Broadcasters Association. ""The federal government licenses the radio and TV stations in California. The federal government’s position is that marijuana is an illegal substance. So, it’s illegal to advertise that substance.""Berry added: ""The stations themselves are federally licensed. So, there is a risk to the license for the station at license renewal.""Experts said cable and satellite television services would likely be subject to similar restrictions.They point to Section 843 of the Controlled Substances Act, which specifically prohibits using ""communications facilities"" to transmit advertisements for the sale of Schedule I drugs, which includes marijuana, heroin and ecstasy, among others. The law was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon in 1970.It defines ""communications facilities"" as any and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication.""Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021Marijuana leaf (AP photo)Legality a cloudy issueOthers say the legality of advertising marijuana on television -- particularly in states that have legalized the drug -- remains cloudy, at best.""There is no (Federal Communications Commission) rule that prohibits such advertisements in states with legalized cannabis,"" Kathleen Kirby, a media lawyer based in Washington D.C., told PolitiFact California in an email.A spokeswoman at the FCC could not point us to one, and declined to elaborate on the subject.Kirby said several of her clients in states where pot is legal have been approached to run marijuana advertisements.""I don’t say no, but I counsel,"" regarding the lack of clarity, Kirby told the American Bar Association in an online article.Kirby noted in the December 2015 article that all of her clients had decided to hold off on the ads.She added in her email to PolitiFact California that federal law ""would need to change to make accepting such ads risk free. The feds have more or less signaled that they will look the other way, but you never know with changes in administration or even changes in federal prosecutors.""No TV ads in other statesIn recent years, federal drug enforcement authorities have taken a ‘hands-off’ approach on the sale and cultivation of marijuana in states that have legalized and regulated the drug. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll look the other way on federal advertising rules, said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the Marijuana Law, Policy and Reform blog.A local TV station in Colorado had planned to run the nation’s first marijuana TV advertisement in 2015, but backed away over concerns about federal rules.Stations have yet to air any marijuana ads on television, Berman said.Those ads would be treated ""from a federal regulatory perspective as equivalent to if you were broadcasting (ads for) heroin,"" the law professor added.The Yes on Proposition 64 campaign filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court in early August demanding what they described as ""false and/or misleading statements"" -- including the claim about marijuana ads on TV at the center of this fact check -- be removed from the official ballot arguments submitted by the measure’s opponents.Efforts to change federal law are underway. But it’s unclear if, when and how much the law will change.Berman said California’s provisions, if approved through Prop 64, could pave the way for advertising on TV, but only if the federal rules change first.""It ain’t happening anytime soon,"" he said. ""Certainly, it’s not something that’s going to automatically happen based on how California votes this fall.""Our rulingCalifornia Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently said the state’s pot legalization initiative ""allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers.""Proposition 64 includes a provision that marijuana advertisements ""shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older.""If Feinstein had said Prop 64 helps pave the way for marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate.But experts say Feinstein’s claim, as she stated it, is misleading. The federal Controlled Substances Act bans TV stations from advertising illegal substances, including marijuana.There’s an element of truth to Feinstein’s statement: The FCC doesn’t have a rule expressly prohibiting marijuana television ads in states that legalize the drug. And federal authorities could choose to ignore the Controlled Substances Act.Still, the experts we spoke with say California’s Prop 64 will not lift the legal cloud of uncertainty by itself.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., criticized Donald Trump’s fiscal proposals during his debut convention speech as the Democratic vice presidential nominee.Independent analysts, Kaine said, ""found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt.""We’ll take a look at this statement in two parts.Trump ‘would rack up $30 trillion in debt’As we have previously reported, this figure originated in an analysis from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals.In its report, the center found that ""including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036."" This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has not specified any cuts to offset his plan.So Kaine has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats.• That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed ""window"" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window.Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion.So Kaine, like Clinton before him, cherry-picked the biggest number for his talking point — a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021• Kaine overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years.The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Kaine cited in the speech.‘Given to the wealthy and big corporations’The benefits of Trump’s plan skew toward the top of the income heap, independent experts have concluded.As we have noted, Trump’s proposal would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty.Meanwhile, Trump’s reforms to the corporate tax code would collapse the eight tax brackets ranging from 15 to 35 percent into a flat rate of 15 percent and to tax the foreign income of U.S. companies abroad.While virtually everyone would pay less under the Trump plan, it offers particularly big benefits to the richest taxpayers.The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent of after-tax income.Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, working out to roughly 1 percent of after-tax income.Our rulingKaine said that independent analysts ""found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."" Kaine is on pretty solid ground with the substance of his assertion, but he’s cherry-picked the biggest figure of several that were available.

Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates?Superdelegates, if you’ll remember from our primer, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party’s system. Under the rules that governed this year’s primaries, the superdelegates weren’t bound to the voting results in their state and could vote for whomever they wish.Many superdelegates backed Clinton before voting even began, and she commanded a disproportionate lead in superdelegates throughout the primaries, eliciting many cries of unfairness and cronyism from voters and Sanders supporters.  But Trump is wrong. Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders.The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us, but the ""analysis"" he may have been referring to could be a blog post on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog.The post’s headline is ""NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!"" It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead.  That math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality.  The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won 3.8 million more than Sanders). Experts told PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer. And to top it off, Sanders himself repeatedly advocated for superdelegates to follow the will of their state’s voters.In other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state’s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton.Here’s a breakdown of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers’ superdelegate count. ClintonTotal (superdelegates)SandersTotal (superdelegates)Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

In raw dollars, Pence’s claim holds up. But when adjusted for inflation, education spending at its highest point under Pence is still lower than it was in 2010 and 2011, before Pence took office.We got some help from Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University who has compiled state budget data.Prior to Pence, Indiana education spending for K-12 and higher education combined peaked at $9.3 billion in 2011, according to DeBoer’s data. Not adjusting for inflation, education spending has surpassed that peak every year from 2014 on.

(For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.)While education spending under Pence is certainly on the rise, the pace of that increase proves not to be so dramatic when adjusted for inflation.Also, the graph appears to show a huge jump in spending leading into 2010. DeBoer noted that this reflects a big change in the spending structure among the state and localities, so it’s not useful to compare education spending today to pre-2010.One more way to put the state’s education spending in context is to look at its size compared with the Indiana economy. Education spending as a share of total Indiana income has been on a consistent decline since 2010, but it is becoming a bigger share of the state budget overall, DeBoer noted.Our rulingPence said that as Indiana governor, he has made ""record investments in education.""In raw dollars, Pence’s statement is accurate.

""We can do more to secure our border, and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows.""This is pretty consistent with her view as a New York senator and secretary of state.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio of Florida. That bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. That bill passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House.Clinton’s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact Florida when we fact-checked a similar claim by Trump that we rated False.Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924.It’s wrong to conflate ""open borders"" with anything less than perfect enforcement of immigration laws, he said. It’s also wrong to ""claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws.""But Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than President Barack Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible — although that is in legal limbo after the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House.Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA.Beck has told PolitiFact that the term ""open borders"" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can ""stay as long as you don’t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don’t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay.""Our rulingGiuliani said, ""Hillary Clinton is for open borders.""Clinton supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions in border security in addition to a path to citizenship. As a presidential candidate she has called for securing the border and targeting deportation to criminals and those who pose security threats. While her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, that’s not the same as allowing a free-for-all at the border and ending enforcement.We rate this claim False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbe27e82-8435-4872-8e49-12f87464cb98","https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s744/text,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/15/compare-candidates-clinton-vs-trump-immigration/,http://www.nbclosangeles.com/on-air/as-seen-on/Hilary-Clinton-Talks-Presidential-Race_Los-Angeles-378354731.html,https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/,http://latinousa.org/2015/11/09/clinton-you-have-to-control-your-borders-video/,/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-marco-rubio-open-border/,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/09/transcript-the-post-univision-democratic-debate-annotated/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/09/transcript-the-post-univision-democratic-debate-annotated/,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-ln-hillary-clinton-rally-20160505-story.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/transcript-msnbc-telemundo-clinton-sanders-town-hall-n520781,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbe27e82-8435-4872-8e49-12f87464cb98",,"Immigration,Florida,Rudy Giuliani",,,,,

His insistence that he will not engage in budget negotiations until Democrats pass business and government reforms led to a historic impasse that has left the state with no budget -- and a fast-growing pile of debt -- since June 30, 2015.To back his case for business-friendly reforms, Rauner frequently cites figures intended to demonstrate the toll Democratic policies have exacted on the state economy.Such was the case June 1, when Rauner appeared with local Republican lawmakers and school officials at the administrative offices of Community Unit School District 3 in Mahomet. Rauner’s visit came a day after, for the second straight year, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly adjourned without passing either Rauner’s various reforms or a state budget.""We’ve had massive out-migration of people and jobs. We have the highest unemployment rate of any state in America,"" Rauner said, detailing a litany of Illinois’ problems on the business and government front. ""We have the highest level of corruption and cronyism and patronage of any state in America. We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois. We are fundamentally in decline because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats.""Rauner made several claims here, but we’re going to focus on the part about family incomes. Is it true that Illinois has lower family incomes today than in 1999?According to his office, Rauner based his claim on U.S. Census Bureau data (click here and scroll to Table H-8) for median household income from 1984 to 2014. The 2015 figure won’t be out until September, so Rauner’s ""last 17 years"" really means from 1999 to 2014.The top chart below shows average annual household incomes for Illinois and Indiana in the period mentioned by Rauner. The lower chart shows Illinois and its neighboring states. Indeed, the 2014 median household income in Illinois was $54,916 and the 1999 median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $65,850. That’s a decline of 16.6 percent.Pretty bad, right?Featured Fact-checkIllinois Republican Partystated on February 5, 2021 in social media posts“Pritzker’s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities” puts prisoners, politicians and college students ahead of “individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.”By Kiannah Sepeda-Miller • February 12, 2021But look at neighboring Indiana, which saw its median household income plummet 17.2 percent -- to the current $48,060 -- in the same time period. Or Wisconsin, which had a 10.5 percent drop. Missouri went from $58,819 in 1999 to $56,630 in 2014 -- a 3.7 percent decline.Nationwide, the inflation-adjusted median income went from $57,843 in 1999 to $53,657 in 2014. That’s a drop of 7.2 percent. So there’s no disputing that Illinois’ median household income fell between 1999 and 2014, but Rauner presented the figure as if Illinois were an outlier among other states; that its political leadership had chartered a uniquely disastrous course. A look at the same time period for Indiana -- a state repeatedly cited by Rauner as a beacon of economic growth -- shows Illinois was far from alone.In fact, only four states in the nation -- Maryland, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon -- had higher median household incomes in 2014 than at some other point in the Census Bureau's 30-year survey. (Only North Dakota had a Republican governor in 2014.)And 1999 is no ordinary year for Illinois in this set of numbers. It’s the year with the highest median household income in the 30 years covered. Had Rauner gone for a 25-year comparison and used 1991’s median household income, he would have found an increase of 1.5 percent ($54,068 in 1991 and $54,916 in 2014).Pinpointing whether and to what extent state government policy influenced an economic trend like median household income is difficult, says Darren H. Lubotsky, a professor in the economics department at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a member of the university’s Institute of Government and Public Affairs.A state’s industrial base is the greatest indicator of how it will reflect or resist an economic downturn like those that hit the national economy after 9/11 and in the Great Recession, Lubotsky says.""Is it accurate to blame state government leadership? Maybe. Is it the unfunded pension liability? The quality of schools? Crime? The so-called culture of corruption? Maybe they all play a role or maybe only some do. I am not sure one could credibly point to what policies really matter,"" Lubotsky says.Our ruling""We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago.""Rauner is stretching the time frame when he says income is lower ""today"" than it was 17 years ago. The Census Bureau won’t even have 2015 figures for three more months.But the bigger problem here is that by choosing the peak income year among 30 years’ worth of data and presenting Illinois as an isolated case, Rauner tacitly asserts that Illinois is unique in seeing lower income ""today"" than in 1999.We rate the statement Half True.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiT_5IS-P8o,https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html,/personalities/illinois-republican-party/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/illinois-republican-party/did-pritzker-prioritize-inmates-pols-and-college-k/",,"Income,Illinois,Bruce Rauner",,,,,

She savaged their dignity and shamed them.""The video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we’ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any were taken out of context.But before that, there’s some history you need to understand.AccusationsThe Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton’s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault.Five women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post.Bill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations.  Sources other than the Washington Post — such as the conservative website Breitbart — have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed.The pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad’s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We didn't weigh in on those issues. What we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton’s quotes. Let’s go one by one.The ‘Cosby’ tweetThe ad says, ""When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.’ ""The ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until ""disbelieved"" by evidence.But the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby.The tweet itself links to Clinton’s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence — CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day.The Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian.No evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby.‘Loony toon’The ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called her husband’s accusers ""loony toon.""The ""loony toon"" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky — whom the Post lists as a consensual affair — as a ""narcissistic loony toon.""Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021The citation is correctly attributed to Blair’s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine.The ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman — Lewinsky.  Experts had differing takes on whether the ""Lewinsky affair"" was consensual or not.‘Floozy, bimbo and stalker’The ad says ""The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy, bimbo and stalker.' "" Note, it does not say Clinton said these words — which she didn't. The terms are found in a book — Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton — by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article.In the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett — Bill Clinton’s former lawyer — referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a ""floozy, bimbo flake."" The book attributes the ""stalker"" remark to Sidney Blumenthal — a former White House aide — speaking with author Christopher Hitchens.The quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate.‘A lot to answer for’The ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said ""some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.""The comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband.""The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president,"" Clinton said.She goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband’s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are ""not going to be proven true.""""And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,"" she said.This could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various ""right-wing"" political operatives based on the interview’s prior context.The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers.The ad claims Clinton was questioning the accounts of the women involved. Going back to the source, that is not certain.The Clinton camp declined to go on record for this fact-check.Our rulingA pro-Trump advertisement makes several claims about Hillary Clinton’s hypocritical treatment of women, relying primarily on her own words or those of close confidants.The broader message — that Clinton enabled her husband’s alleged sexual assaults — has been and continues to be debated, by pundits and experts alike.We didn't weigh in on those arguments, but we did look into the ad’s more specific use of quotes attributed to Clinton. The quotes themselves are hearsay in some cases and subject to different interpretations based on context.The ad further misleads by saying Hillary Clinton ""savaged"" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault ""and shamed them.""We rate this claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOK4i35BcXA,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/90s-scandals-threaten-to-erode-hillary-clintons-strength-with-women.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/30/a-guide-to-the-allegations-of-bill-clintons-womanizing/?tid=a_inl,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/31/rap-sheet-the-women-who-claim-to-be-victims-of-bill-and-hillary-clinton/,https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/668597149291184128,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wr9PFK52wg,https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/campus-sexual-assault/,https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/11/13/4-more-women-to-join-defamation-suit-against-bill-cosby,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-monica-lewinsky-a-narcissistic-loony-toon/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,https://books.google.com/books?id=1v5e4lZiS08C&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=floozy+bimbo+clinton&source=bl&ots=2QSUeDS7U-&sig=eoiBv8wIY9zLRiZ4dEufiQnpV38&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxqryy-c3NAhUB1CYKHUnACfsQ6AEIWzAN#v=onepage&q=floozy%20bimbo%20clinton&f=false,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/90s-scandals-threaten-to-erode-hillary-clintons-strength-with-women.html,http://leany.com/Conspiracy/hillary_clinton_transcript.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/29/pro-trump-groups-ad-misrepresents-hillary-clintons-comments-about-women/,https://www.amazon.com/Hell-Pay-Unfolding-Hillary-Clinton/dp/0895261979,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6",,"National,Candidate Biography,History,Women,Rebuilding America Now",,,,,

Clinton was introduced at her rally by a Durham teacher and by former Gov. Jim Hunt, a Democrat known for his education initiatives.""You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education,"" Clinton said. ""Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family.""There are two things here that made our ears perk up. Can the average teacher ""barely support a family"" on his or her salary? And if not, is it the fault of McCrory and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature?How much teachers makeThe average North Carolina public school teacher made $47,819 in 2014-15 according to the National Education Association, an advocacy group. Both the NEA and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction have estimated the average teacher this school year is making just shy of $48,000.That’s the equivalent of slightly more than $23 per hour when adjusted to 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.That’s not the schedule teachers work, but we’ll use it for the sake of comparison since it’s what most people are familiar with.North Carolina’s cost of livingWhat does it mean to be barely able to support a family? Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond on the record, but there are a few ways of looking at it.The average teacher’s salary is more than triple the minimum wage. It’s also enough to keep a family of nine out of poverty. For a more traditional family of four, it’s about double the poverty level.But the government’s poverty guidelines have faced criticism for being outdated and/or inaccurate. So what about other ways of measuring ways to support a family?MIT professor Amy Glasmeier created something called the Living Wage Calculator. It takes local-level data on taxes, rent, transportation, food, child care and other costs into account. The formula also assumes non-working adults are providing full-time child care.Glasmeier has written that it shows ""the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses"" – a pretty good approximation of what Clinton was talking about.A single parent making the average teacher’s salary could support one child but would struggle to support two children, according to the living wage calculations.Likewise, if the teacher is married with a child, an average salary could easily support the child and a stay-at-home spouse.The salary would still be considered a living wage even if that couple had a second child – here it gets to the level of barely enough – but not if they had a third child and the spouse remained unemployed.Featured Fact-checkJenna Wadsworthstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.""By Paul Specht • February 1, 2021But we didn’t want to just take a calculator’s word for it. So we asked a professor who studies poverty and politics, Duke University’s Anirudh Krishna. He agreed that a teacher’s salary can provide for a family’s basic needs but not much more.""An annual salary of $48,000 is less than what typically makes for significant intergenerational upward mobility,"" Krishna said. ""Rents or mortgages usually make up for half of that amount, and food and fuel account for much of the rest, leaving relatively little for a rainy day, far less for a child’s college education.""So this part of Clinton’s claim could be accurate or not, depending on how big the family in question is and what you consider to be barely supporting that family – whether it’s simply keeping the children out of poverty or being able to do more.But is Clinton right to pin the blame on Republicans for not giving teachers even higher salaries?Political blameSince 2010, the average teacher has earned right around the state’s median household income. Republicans took control of the state legislature in January 2011.In most states, teachers make more. North Carolina is one of the 10 lowest-paying states for teachers, and inflation-adjusted salaries have dropped 10.2 percent in the last decade, according to the NEA. Only three states saw teachers’ salaries fall by more between 2004-05 and 2014-15.Who is responsible? Both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their watch in the last decade, although Democrats were in power most of that time.Under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley average teacher pay grew by thousands of dollars, to $48,454 in 2008-09, his last year in office.Then the Great Recession happened and in 2009-10, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue ordered a pay cut for state employees and teachers. That cut was approved by a Democrat-led legislature, and average teacher pay continued to fall every year under Perdue.Republicans were in charge of the statehouse the last two years of Perdue’s term. Both years, Perdue vetoed the budget and said more money should’ve been spent on education, but to no avail.Average teacher pay continued dropping after she left office. It reached its lowest point in McCrory’s first budget – the third year of GOP legislative control – when it dipped below $45,000 to 47th in the nation in 2013-14.But since then, teacher pay has been rising. It’s still not yet back to pre-recession levels, but it could be next year. The House, Senate and McCrory’s office have all said teachers ought to earn more than $50,000 on average in 2016-17.Our rulingClinton said the average North Carolina teacher’s salary ""can barely support a family"" and placed the blame squarely on Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators.The average teacher salary of just less than $48,000 is higher than what most households around the state make per year. Yet it’s also right around what’s considered the bare minimum ""living wage"" for a couple with two kids.Clinton, however, muddles the political blame. Average teacher pay did hit its lowest point when Republicans controlled both the governor’s office and General Assembly. Yet the only actual salary cuts happened under Democratic control. And more recently, Republicans have raised teacher pay almost back to pre-recession levels.We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af0c5cf5-08de-414b-8ccd-705444c458a8","http://livingwage.mit.edu/resources/Living-Wage-User-Guide-and-Technical-Notes-2015.pdf,/personalities/jenna-wadsworth/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/jenna-wadsworth/elaine-marshall-has-won-more-statewide-races-anyon/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af0c5cf5-08de-414b-8ccd-705444c458a8",,"Education,Families,State Budget,Workers,North Carolina,Hillary Clinton",,,,,

It enters the body, spins & explodes.""",,politifact,,"Filmmaker and liberal commentator Michael Moore made a provocative claim about the ammunition used in the June 12 Orlando shooting — that it is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.""Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention,"" Moore tweeted June 14. ""It enters the body, spins & explodes. Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over.""  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later identified as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check’s publication.Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore's office but didn't hear back. What is the Geneva Convention?The 1949 Geneva Conventions are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without ""judicial guarantees.""In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes — the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime.The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the supplementary protocols.The closest thing to Moore’s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits ""weapons, projectiles and materials … causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering"" but does not offer further clarification.In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime.""No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition,"" Joyner said.Mateen’s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions.Different conventionsWe looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen’s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases.The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams.Declaration III of the 1899 Hague Convention bans bullets that ""expand or flatten"" upon entering the body — commonly known as ""hollow-point bullets."" The same language is included in the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.The catch? Hague only applies ""in the case of war"" between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross notes that many parties to the Hague Convention use ""expanding bullets"" in their domestic police forces.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore’s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention.""That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force,"" Mauser said.In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a ban on a narrowly defined type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said.""ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation,"" said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor.The bulletsExperts are unsure whether Mateen’s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used.George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore’s tweet) are .223 ""full metal jackets.""These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are ""not expanding,"" ""not explosive,"" and ""not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition."" Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle.However, investigators have not confirmed whether ""full metal jackets"" were in fact what Mateen used.Tim O’Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen’s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point ""controlled expansion"" rounds in Florida, he said.Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets’ ""spin,"" O’Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to ""tumble"" in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired.O’Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body.Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries noted the severe damage done to victim’s bodies, such as ""big, giant cavities"" in the victims.One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue.""It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn't hit,"" said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver.""Our rulingMoore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition.Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen’s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement.That being said, Moore’s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors’ reports support Moore on the general point about damages.We rate Moore’s claim False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a","https://twitter.com/MMFlint/status/742873607936712704,https://twitter.com/ATFHQ/status/742105007693156352,https://nypost.com/2016/06/13/weapons-used-in-nightclub-shooting-bought-at-ex-nypd-cops-gun-shop/,https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf,https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions,https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=568842C2B90F4A29C12563CD0051547C,http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp,http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/lawwar.asp,https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf,https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule77,/personalities/greg-kelly/,/factchecks/2021/feb/09/greg-kelly/newsmax-host-falsely-claims-only-one-person-died-c/,http://www.smallarmsstandards.org/isacs/0330-en.pdf,http://www.smallarmsstandards.org/isacs/0120-en.pdf,http://www.philly.com/philly/news/science/20160616_Doctors__High-velocity_Orlando_rifle_inflicts__quot_devastating_quot__wounds.html,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a",,"PunditFact,Guns,Michael Moore",,,,,

""If by cartel you mean a group that gets together behind closed doors to set policy, that does not happen.""Meanwhile, there are approximately 4,200 accredited colleges and universities in the United States. And they compete against each other for students, government aid and grant money. Each institution decides what degrees to offer and what is required to attain them.Indeed, anyone can create a college — the accreditation only comes in as a means for students to get federal student loans.""As we know from Trump ‘University’ and from McDonald’s ‘University,’ you can use it as a euphemism,"" Nassirian said. ""You can use it in any context you want to. And nobody stops you from awarding whatever degree you want to award.""We also turned to somehow who knows cartels well — Ellen R. Wald, an expert on the OPEC oil cartel and a professor of social science at Jacksonville University.She defines cartel as ""a group of companies or countries that coordinate and collude to set prices by increasing or decreasing production in unison.""There is no indication that universities collude to determine the number of diplomas granted, let alone the price, she said. If they appear to act in unison, it is because they are responding to the same government regulation and accreditation requirements.""The only example in which universities coordinate to set prices is the Ivy League's decision to prohibit scholarships that are not need-based, which has the effect of raising overall prices,"" she said.Even then, the eight Ivy League schools are only a tiny portion of the 4,200 accredited institutions.Our ratingRyan called to break up the ""college cartel,"" implying that collusion is preventing better options from entering the higher education market.While it is true that the accreditation process acts as a ""gatekeeper"" of federal student aid, but that is a policy standard and, in practice, is different than a cartel which would require collusion between institutions and many other factors.For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/060b4ac4-b038-4783-aeff-ab62c05fe309","https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/opinion/nocera-the-college-sports-cartel.html,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/293763/college-cartel-vance-h-fried-reihan-salam,http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/expanding_opportunity_in_america.pdf,http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cartel,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-advances-transparency-agenda-accreditation,http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/agencies.aspx,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/060b4ac4-b038-4783-aeff-ab62c05fe309",,"Education,Wisconsin,Paul Ryan",,,,,

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says he pushed to crack down on the financial services industry even before the financial collapse. And, he says he played a role in the 2010 financial reform bill.Canova, a law professor and first-time candidate, said in a June 1 Medium post he ""helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments.""Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., co-author of the reform bill, expressed some skepticism that Canova played a role.""He does seem to be denigrating the financial reform bill, of which I was a co-sponsor, while simultaneously claiming credit for having written it,"" Frank said at a press conference for Wasserman Schultz in Broward May 31.We decided to fact-check Canova’s role in helping to draft part of Dodd-Frank.Effort to audit the Federal ReserveThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a sweeping law with multiple components intended to avert another financial meltdown. (Canova has some criticisms of the law which he details in his book, The Bottom-Up Recovery.)The part of the law Canova said he helped draft related to auditing the Federal Reserve, including its emergency lending in the aftermath of the economic collapse.  At the time, Canova was a professor of international economic law at Chapman University in California.U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought for two decades  to pass a bill to audit the fed. Bipartisan interest in Paul’s pet project grew after the financial collapse.The House Financial Services Committee passed an amendment 43-26 to audit the Fed on Nov. 19, 2009. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, whipped Democratic votes. The amendment required government audits of the Federal Reserve including how much the central bank lent to banks. Critics felt it could lead the auditors to interfere with monetary policy.""It was a major legislative achievement, the first time the Federal Reserve was subject to audit, and again over the objections of Barney Frank,"" Canova told PolitiFact Florida.The concern about monetary policy drew objections from Frank, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd, the Fed and the Obama administration. So the Senate author, Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, scaled back audit powers to exclude monetary policy but include disclosing information about the emergency loans. The limited audit was included in the final Dodd-Frank bill that was signed by Obama in July 2010.Canova’s role was behind the scenes, serving as a resource to at least a couple of House and Senate staffers at the time.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021Canova said he was contacted by staffers on Capitol Hill after he published articles on the Federal Reserve. (One of his articles, ""Financial Market Failure as a Crisis in the Rule of Law,"" was published in the Harvard Law Policy and Review in 2009.) He was also quoted in many news articles about the financial crisis.One of those staffers was Matt Stoller, a senior policy adviser to Grayson who worked on the amendment.Canova ""was an adviser as we worked on the Federal Reserve emergency lending disclosure provisions of Dodd-Frank,"" Stoller told PolitiFact Florida. (In 2011, Stoller wrote an op-ed about the Federal Reserve and quoted Canova.)Another staffer was Warren Gunnels, an aide to Sanders. Canova also told Rolling Stone that he worked with some of Sanders' staff on the bill. (Gunnels now works on Sanders’ presidential campaign and did not respond to emails from PolitiFact Florida.) Sanders named Canova to a committee to advise him on Federal Reserve reform in 2011. Sanders backs Canova in his congressional race.Canova forwarded to PolitiFact Florida a few emails he exchanged with Stoller and Gunnels in July 2010 shortly before the Senate passed Dodd-Frank.For example, in an email July 13, 2010, Canova wrote to Gunnels: ""I have continued working through the provisions of the Dodd-Frank conference committee bill."" Canova suggested that Sanders insert into the record some clarifying language that the audit would apply to financial assistance from the Federal Reserve starting Dec. 1, 2007, through the enactment of the bill.""I am happy to claim a small bit of credit for a supporting role in helping the drafters of one of the very best provisions of the act,"" Canova told PolitiFact Florida.In an interview, Frank -- who is backing Wasserman Schultz -- told PolitiFact Florida he had never heard of Canova while working on the bill. As for the audit portion of the law, Frank argued Canova shouldn’t get credit because the final version didn’t include auditing monetary policy. Frank said he opposed that portion because he saw it as ""political interference.""Frank said he didn’t want the members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ""being called before an auditor and asked about votes on interest rates.""Our rulingCanova says he ""helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill.""The Dodd-Frank bill was a sweeping piece of legislation with many components. Canova was involved in one piece of the bill.Canova played a behind-the-scenes role advising a House staff member and a Senate staff member about amendments to allow the government to audit the Federal Reserve.

Michael Bennet of wanting to give nuclear weapons to Iran.The ad opens with a narrator highlighting Keyser’s role as a military intelligence officer in Iraq, where he ""conducted capture and kill missions to remove high value targets in urban areas.""""For us, Baghdad was the roughest. We weren’t fighting amateurs; we were fighting a vicious enemy armed by Iran,"" Keyser says.Then he pivots to the claim we’re fact-checking: ""Now Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it.""Keyser is among five Republicans vying to win the June 28 primary and the right to take on Bennet in the general election.He’s not the only Republican attacking a Democratic opponent this election season on the Iran deal, which the Obama administration and five other nations approved in 2015.Earlier this month, PolitiFact Florida issued a False rating when a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate said two Democratic opponents ""supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.""Those Democrats did support the deal, but the intention was clearly not to allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. When we rechecked the terms for this fact-check, we found that was still the case.Keyser’s ad goes a step further to say Obama and Bennet want Iran to produce such a weapon. That incendiary characterization is also not true.We contacted the Keyser campaign. A spokesman did not provide evidence to back up the claim.The deal’s termsThe deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years.A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb.  Featured Fact-checkHarry Reidstated on February 19, 2010 in a television interview with Las Vegas political analyst Jon Ralston""We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is.""By Louis Jacobson • February 22, 2010To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be.Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes.Several experts have told PolitiFact in recent months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated.A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s ""breakout time"" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal.""It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. ""It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days.""Bennet was among a majority of Democrats who voted three times over 10 days in September to successfully block a Republican resolution to kill the Iran deal. According to the New York Times, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called multiple votes on the measure to reject the Iran accord. In part, he wanted to see if he could win a few votes needed to break the deadlock, the Times reported, but the votes also forced Democrats to repeatedly endorse a deal that they’d have to defend this election year.  In a statement after his vote, Bennet said, ""My conclusion is that the (Iran agreement) is more likely to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than the plausible alternatives.""Bennet added that the deal ""has flaws,"" and he has co-sponsored legislation to ""clarify better how we will respond if Iran cheats on this deal."" The legislation, which remains in committee, seeks to create a ""strategy with our partners to ensure that Iran appreciates the consequences of its violations, for the next 15 years and beyond,"" he said in a separate statement.Our rulingKeyser said, ""Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it.""Keyser portrays the agreement as a plot to arm Iran with nukes when it’s designed to do exactly the opposite.The terms of the deal forbid Iran from pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must allow inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal).It's ridiculous to say Obama and Bennet wanted this deal because they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c9edf88f-91bb-450c-82cf-14dacd88c0e3","https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/may/11/carlos-beruff/deal-allows-iran-produce-nuclear-weapon-us-senate-/,/personalities/harry-reid/,/factchecks/2010/feb/23/harry-reid/reid-calls-nuclear-waste-issue-solved/,http://dailysignal.com/2015/08/14/yes-iran-can-hide-nuclear-material-in-24-days-iran-deals-details-show-fatal-flaws/,http://www.cq.com/docag/H4sIAAAAAAAAAEvLyc8vKssvSdU1MjU0NTYAAgDFpymgEwAAAA?18,http://www.cq.com/docag/H4sIAAAAAAAAAEvLyc8vKssvSdU1MjU0NTczMDAAANlewnATAAAA?16,http://www.cq.com/docag/H4sIAAAAAAAAAEvLyc8vKssvSdU1MjU0MzQAAgALhn1cEwAAAA?3,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-senate.html?_r=0,https://www.bennet.senate.gov/?p=release&id=3446,https://www.bennet.senate.gov/?p=release&id=3473,https://www.bennet.senate.gov/?p=release&id=3437,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c9edf88f-91bb-450c-82cf-14dacd88c0e3",,"Colorado,Nuclear,Jon  Keyser",,,,,

She wants them all released.""",,politifact,,"Donald Trump didn’t mince words about Hillary Clinton’s criminal justice agenda when he addressed the National Rifle Association’s national convention on May 20, 2016.""President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians,"" Trump said. He continued, ""This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.""We think most observers would agree that releasing every violent criminal in American prisons would amount to political suicide, not to mention bad policy. But we thought it was worth checking Clinton's actual policy prescriptions.What Trump said is far off-base. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)Existing criminal-justice reform effortsTrump said Clinton wants to continue Obama’s release of ""thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members."" But Trump overreaches both on the substance of the policy and on Obama’s personal role in enacting it.In recent years, liberals and conservatives have increasingly found common ground over criminal justice reform. Many on the left, center and right -- including the libertarian Koch brothers and the generally more liberal American Civil Liberties Union -- have come to agree that many tough-on-crime policies instituted between the 1970s and the 1990s were misguided. They argue that policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and tough prosecution of low-level drug offenders have led to overcrowded prisons and exacerbated racial injustices.Obama has taken some steps to unwind these policies. Using his pardon powers, Obama has commuted the sentences of more than 200 inmates who had been convicted of drug crimes, though it’s important to note -- as Trump does not -- that all of them have been considered nonviolent under Justice Department guidelines.In addition, during Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department has approved the release of 6,000 federal inmates, about two-thirds of them to halfway houses or home confinement and about one-third who are expected to be deported.Unlike the commutations, these releases were prompted not by Obama but by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent body. In unanimously approving the changes, the panel estimated that the reduced sentencing guidelines could eventually qualify 46,000 of roughly 100,000 drug offenders in federal prisons for early release, according to the Washington Post. (It does not affect the larger pool of offenders in state prisons.) And federal judges must approve all early releases.Though applicants for early release typically have a connection to drug trafficking, the releases are not intended to free drug-traffickers and gang members who have a record of violence, as Trump contends. Obama’s then-Attorney General Eric Holder actually proposed excluding convicts who had used weapons or had significant criminal histories, but the commission put its trust in judges to weigh those factors on a case-by-case basis, the Post reported.The commission submitted the proposal to Congress in April 2014, and Congress did nothing to stop the proposal from taking effect six months later.What Clinton supportsClinton does support criminal justice reform, but we found no evidence that her plan includes the release of ""violent criminals,"" much less ""all"" of them.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021For starters, we should note that the Sentencing Commission’s action is now a done deal. Short of calling on the commission to reverse itself -- which the panel, being independent, could simply ignore -- or passing a law through Congress, there isn’t really anything Clinton (or Trump) could easily do to stop the forthcoming early releases. And of course, federal judges, not the president, are the ones who must sign off on applications for early release.More broadly, we looked at Clinton’s stated proposals for criminal justice policy and found that she focused her initiatives only on ""nonviolent"" offenders. The Clinton campaign said Trump’s comment is a misrepresentation of her views.On the criminal justice reform page of her website, Clinton summarizes her key proposals as follows:• ""End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons.""• ""Encourage the use of smart strategies — like police body cameras — and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities.""• ""Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society.""It’s worth noting that Clinton focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates.""Clinton has not focused on early release,"" said John H. Laub, a professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland.For a politician, this is a canny omission, because it sidesteps difficult questions about who should be released early.""There is little consensus about releasing violent criminals from prison before their terms end,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Then there is the question of who is ‘violent.’ Someone who has a prior record for a violent crime but whose current charge is for a nonviolent crime. or only those with a current charge for violence?""But even if Clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which, if any, inmates deserve early release, that position does throw a wrench into Trump’s accusation that it’s her stated ""agenda"" to ""release"" violent criminals.If anything, Clinton’s policy page bends over backward to focus her attention on ""nonviolent,"" rather than violent, offenders. Proposals specify ""nonviolent"" offenders no fewer than seven times. This consistent focus on nonviolent offenders undermines the notion that Clinton wants to release violent offenders at all, much less to do so willy-nilly.Our rulingTrump said it ""is Hillary Clinton's agenda"" to ""release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.""It would be preposterous for any politician who wants to win an election to propose freeing every violent criminal from jail. Like many political figures today on the right, center and left, Clinton supports something much more modest — easing how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent offenders.

But it has also caused frictions between Republicans and Democrats.A case in point is a recent Twitter exchange between presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party.On May 11, Warren tweeted this: ""You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?""Later that day, Trump tweeted back: ""Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!""Did Trump say he wants to abolish the federal minimum wage?To be honest, Trump's comments are so all over the map that it's hard to definitively say. That said, it's also wrong of Trump to accuse Warren of lying. First, some background. There’s a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 an hour -- that sets an absolute wage floor for the country as a whole. Beyond that, though, states can set their own minimum wages higher than the national level, and many of them have. (This map shows the current state-by-state breakdown.) In the meantime, localities can also set minimum wage levels higher than that of their state.The clearest example of Trump seeming to propose abolishing the federal minimum wage came in the May 8, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, when host Chuck Todd prodded Trump on his minimum wage views. Here’s the relevant exchange:Todd: ""Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states--""Trump: ""No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.""By answering no, we think many people would assume Trump does not want a minimum wage set by the federal government. That's what Warren certainly thought.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021We asked the Trump campaign whether he had simply misspoken in the heat of the interview and meant to say he supported keeping a $7.25 wage nationally and letting states set their own wage floor higher. But we didn’t hear back.Trump's other recent comments about the minimum wage articulate no clear position.• In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, ""Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.""• During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are ""too high"" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, ""I would not do it.""• In December 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tweeted, ""Donald Trump does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has said that he thinks wages in America are too high."" Trump tweeted back, ""[email protected] blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!""• On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, ""Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility.""• In the May 8 Meet the Press interview, Trump said, ""I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states.

""Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment.""We asked the Trump campaign for evidence for this claim, but they didn’t get back to us. The Clinton campaign vehemently denied it.""Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment,"" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said.We found no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. Schwerin’s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the past few years about the right to bear arms.However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few of Clinton’s comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted.Straight shooting on the campaign trailIn both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for stronger background check requirements all the while affirming her support for the right to bear arms.Clinton does want to keep guns out of the hands of ""people we all agree shouldn't have them — domestic abusers, violent felons, and dangerously mentally ill people,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence. But Trump’s charge exaggerates the controls she wants to put in place and ignores what she has said on the record.""I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this,"" she said in a January 2008 Democratic presidential debate.In response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia in August 2015, she said, ""We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.""More recently, she tweeted in April 2016,  ""We can protect our Second Amendment rights AND take commonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It’s just a question of whether we choose to.""Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over two points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence.Two smoking guns?Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall.Clinton said in October 2015 that a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was ""worth looking into."" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021That program is ""incompatible with private ownership of guns,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Dave Kopel, a pro-gun rights attorney and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver, equates her musing about Australia’s program as ""wanting to abolish the Second Amendment."" (The NRA shares this view.)The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program.""Communities have done that in our country. Several communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering on the national level if that could be arranged,"" she said, before comparing the buybacks to Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration’s voluntary vehicle trade-in program.Second, Clinton said she disagrees with the the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms.""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,"" she said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser.Volokh called the comment ""a smoking gun"" that bolsters Trump’s charge. Reversing Heller, said Kopel, would be a huge blow to the individual right to bear arms They both pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia and not the individual right to bear arms.Put both comments together, and Trump is correct, said NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter.UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.)""If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,"" he said. ""If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth.""The Clinton campaign told us Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.""This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment.Our rulingTrump said, ""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.""We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton’s comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence.Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation.For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct. So we rate it False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/132d21e9-e2e0-4082-b319-0d67d30341e8","https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/07/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-second-amendment/,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15demdebate-transcript.html,http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/candidates/2015/08/26/hillary-clinton-joe-biden-virginia-shooting-email-iowa-caucuses/32422669/,https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/719617115217661953,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15demdebate-transcript.html,https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/636871928280653824,http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/06/hillary-clinton-gun-control-stance/73483616/,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/996108027112393,https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/684423913863000065,https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/687831412528025605,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/31/stephen-king/stephen-king-says-australia-cracked-down-guns-homi/,http://www.c-span.org/video/?328774-1/hillary-clinton-town-hall-meeting-keene-new-hampshire&start=2824,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://membership.nrahq.org/6246/join,https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO,https://soundcloud.com/washington-free-beacon/clinton-bashes-nra,http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/07-290_amicus_former_doj_officials.pdf,https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZD.html,http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/us-heller-brief-1-11-08.pdf,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/132d21e9-e2e0-4082-b319-0d67d30341e8",,"National,Guns,Donald Trump",,,,,

Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina’s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show.The law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone’s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court.It was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State.On the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical.The show’s titular hosts – two down-home comedians with a conservative bent – are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations.So it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen’s name was brought up – although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law.""Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry – which is happening as I write – is one of them,"" Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show.McCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn’t command the adoration he once did – and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert.""I love Bruce Springsteen,"" McCrory said. ""I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn’t mention that. They didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted.""That got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number.Where'd he hear that?Here at PolitiFact North Carolina, we’ve seen our fair share of videos from Springsteen’s live shows (mostly to marvel at Nils Lofgren’s guitar solos). The crowds are always sizeable, if not sold out. We would be quite surprised if Springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his Greensboro show just two days before the concert.The Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics.So that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen – especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021But those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don’t care much for the Jersey rocker’s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers?No, according to the Greensboro Coliseum.Andrew Brown, the arena’s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets.""No idea where 8,000 may have come from,"" Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days’ notice.""It’s safe to say it would have sold out,"" he said.Like Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory’s campaign hasn’t responded to our questions, but we’ll update this if we hear back.The Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen’s cancellation cost it $100,000.Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Demi Lovato/Nick Jonas and Ani DiFranco have also canceled, while such acts as Jimmy Buffett, Beyonce and Mumford & Sons have played but spoken out against the law from on stage or in written statements.As for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth.Our rulingMcCrory was way off on the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact, the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty.That’s not just false – ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, it’s on fire. Pants on Fire!UPDATE: McCrory apologizesThe night after our fact-check went up, we heard back from Pat McCrory’s office about his claim that only 8,000 tickets had been sold.Although he’s standing by another claim he made – that he loves Springsteen’s music – McCrory admitted he was wrong about the sales figure and that it was the reason for the cancellation.""The governor apologizes for using the wrong number,"" wrote his spokesman, Josh Ellis, in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. ""It’s too bad Bruce Springsteen actually canceled on nearly 15,000 people at the last minute.

He then laid out some rather unflattering and harsh comparisons:""Fifteen neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank in Palestine. Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. We are talking about the United States of America in the year 2016 — a country in which the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.""While it would be wrong to take Sanders’ claim to mean that conditions overall are worse than Baltimore, we found that his specific comparisons are largely accurate.""The comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries,"" said Alan Berube, an expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution. ""This isn't isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes.""Let’s take Sanders’ claims one by one.Life expectancy in North KoreaThe Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.)His number is slightly outdated.  In 2014, the latest year where there’s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years.Residents in 12 of Baltimore's 56 neighborhoods lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That’s not 15, but it’s close.(For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S. national average, and four of them are relatively affluent and white.)Here’s a map from the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world:Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post“WHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 1, 2021An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down.Infant mortality in the West BankFor this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a Vox article that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore — Little Italy and Greenmount East — had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013.But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, 13.49 out of 1,000 babies died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA’s World Factbook.The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000.In 2014, 11 Baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That’s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and oppressive Uzbekistan.Teen health in distressed cities in developing countriesSanders claimed that ""Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa."" The Sanders campaign cited a Washington Post article by Johns Hopkins University researchers. ""Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China,"" they write.Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the Johns Hopkins researchers don’t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa’s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate.The researchers published a comprehensive set of studies published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2014 that compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China.Baltimore teens reported the highest rates pregnancy and, after Johannesburg, the second highest rates of substance use, sexual and physical violence, and feeling unsafe in their community:Our rulingSanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rivaled that of ""the West Bank in Palestine,"" ""North Korea,"" and ""distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.Some of Sanders’ figures need to be updated, but the gist of his specific comparisons are accurate: 12 Baltimore neighborhoods have a lower life expectancy than North Korea; 11 have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank; and research shows health conditions are worse for poor teens than in Baltimore than in Ibadan, New Delhi and Shanghai.We rate his claim Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525deb4c-b6b0-41fb-bfa0-ffb25203ddcc","http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/24/bernie_sanders_in_baltimore_poverty_is_a_death_sentence_similar_to_palestine_or_north_korea.html,https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/sep/21/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/30/baltimores-poorest-residents-die-20-years-earlier-than-its-richest/,https://web.archive.org/web/20150814201631/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html,http://bniajfi.org/indicators/Children%20and%20Family%20Health/LifeExp/,http://bniajfi.org/community/Cross-Country_Cheswolde/,http://bniajfi.org/community/North%20Baltimore_Guilford_Homeland/,http://bniajfi.org/community/Mount%20Washington_Coldspring/,http://bniajfi.org/community/Glen-Fallstaff/,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/blog-posting/who-did-not-say-you-dont-need-wear-mask/,https://www.vox.com/2015/5/4/8541369/infant-mortality-baltimore,https://web.archive.org/web/20150428041451/https://www.cia.gov/library//publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html,http://bniajfi.org/indicators/Children%20and%20Family%20Health/mort1/,https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/uzbekistan,https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/30/heres-one-way-baltimore-teens-are-worse-off-than-poor-youths-in-nigeria-and-india/,http://www.jahonline.org/issue/S1054-139X(14)X0003-0,http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00332-2/pdf,http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00356-5/pdf,http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00354-1/pdf,http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00355-3/pdf,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525deb4c-b6b0-41fb-bfa0-ffb25203ddcc",,"Global News Service,Poverty,Public Health,Bernie Sanders",,,,,

So we decided to check the claim.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001, decreasing from 856,200 to 564,900 in the span of 15 years. That correlates with a 34 percent decrease in jobs lost -- quite close to Trump’s 35 percent claim.However, the job loss in Harrisburg is off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the Harrisburg metropolitan area had 30,500 manufacturing jobs in January 2001 and now is home to 21,400. That’s a decrease of 30 percent, not 40 percent as Trump claimed Thursday.His campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.Trump was right when he told supporters in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has been among the hardest hit in the country by a loss in manufacturing jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C., reported last year that eight states lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 1998 -- Pennsylvania came in seventh behind California, Ohio, North Carolina, New York, Michigan and Illinois.That job loss is significant for a state that, in 2013, employed 10 percent of its job force in the manufacturing sector and made 12 percent of its gross domestic product from the industry. Major hubs of manufacturing the state were, at one point, steel mills in western Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, and the shipyard in South Philadelphia. The size of those industries has largely decreased since their heyday.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021Kevin L. Kearns, president of the United States Business and Industry Council, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents mid-sized manufacturing companies, said manufacturing job loss since 2001 can be chalked up to globalization and the proliferation of the use of robotics in manufacturing.He said thousands of jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector to technology. But the companies his organization represented that shut down in the last decade didn’t do so because of technology -- they did it because other companies in their supply chain had outsourced to other countries.Kearns said the impact of manufacturing job loss has an impact on every corner of the Pennsylvania economy, as people who were once middle class are now either jobless or in other industries that may not pay as well, causing them to spend less in other ways.""In a generalized way, it means that people in Pennsylvania are earning less money,"" he said. ""It has a massive footprint and a massive ripple effect.""Our rulingIn an attempt to show Pennsylvanians he would work to bring back jobs, Trump said ""Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001"" and ""Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001.""The figure about the statewide manufacturing job loss checks out, but his claim about Harrisburg losing 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001 is off by about 10 percent.

At issue: Whether to replace a city ordinance requiring ride-hailing services to submit drivers to background checks including fingerprinting with a mandate preferred by the services which doesn’t require fingerprinting.The letter’s first section refers to a tally of Travis County sexual assaults in 2015 before noting that many assaults go unreported, a conclusion the letter attributes to a Jan. 28, 2016, press release from SAFE, which stands for Stop Abuse for Everyone; the alliance brings together the Austin Children’s Shelter and SafePlace, which says it provides safety for individuals and families affected by sexual and domestic violence.In a new paragraph, the letter says safety ""must be a priority for our city, and that includes the safety of riders."" Then the letter says:""In the words of one of SAFE Alliance’s forensic nurses ‘I have taken care of about a thousand people in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault . . . I am now seeing a pattern of rape reports that all involve ridesharing and it is of extreme concern to me.’""SAFE describes ‘seeing too many sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month in our offices.’""One reported assault-by-driver a month?Group points to web postWe asked the campaign coordinator for Our City, Our Safety, Our Choice about the basis of the quoted statement. By email, Mykle Tomlinson replied that the letter originated with supportive women, not the group. He also pointed us to the Jan. 28, 2016, web post by Kelly White, CEO of the SAFE Alliance.And at first, it looked to us like the anti-proposition group’s claim was fully backed by what White wrote.In fact, after White’s post declares the rate of ""one per month,"" it says that’s an undercount, adding: ""And that’s just the people we see, which is not nearly everyone. Some go to other organizations, some go to the police, and sadly many go nowhere at all.""That well could be. At the least, a January 2016 Austin Police Department break-out of complaints about sex assaults connected to local ride-hailed vehicles or taxi rides supports speculation there may have been more than one alleged sex assault a month in 2015 connected to a ride-hailed driver. The department’s list, which we fielded for another fact check, indicates that from Jan. 15, 2015 through Jan. 1, 2016, police fielded 23 complaints concerning drivers for Uber, Lyft or, in two cases, ""independent"" ride-hailed vehicles. Entries on the list indicate possible crimes ranging from assault ""sexual nature"" to sexual assault to rape.We asked the Uber and Lyft companies for input about this claim. By email, Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin said that of the SAFE-described assault allegations, ""we have not been notified of any arrests or charges of this nature against a driver while using the Uber platform in Austin."" We didn’t hear back from Lyft.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021Pattern in 2015 hasn’t extended into 2016So, case closed on this ""one per month"" claim?Not quite, we found, because Austin’s SAFE reports no such reports from sex-assault victims in 2016.White, whom we reached by phone, said she wrote her January post to endorse an attempt by Austin Mayor Steve Adler to encourage, not require, individuals to provide their fingerprints before being permitted to work for Austin ride-hailing services.And, White told us, the ""one per month"" statement was rooted in the experiences of the alliance’s forensic nurses who, starting in June 2015, were newly available on the group’s campus to provide no-charge sexual assault forensic exams like those needed for evidence purposes; a clinic dedicated to providing the exams, Eloise House, opened on the campus in August 2015. By phone, alliance spokeswoman Victoria Berryhill said the alliance had become the sole Austin-area provider of the exams previously performed by another group in hospitals.Through 2015, White said, six women each told a nurse she’d been taken home and assaulted by a driver for the Uber or Lyft service. ""The pattern was of young women alone late at night"" or in ""early morning hours, getting under the influence, getting into a vehicle with a stranger,"" White said, ""and then they were getting taken back to their homes and they were getting assaulted in their own homes.""However, in the first few months of 2016, Austin’s SAFE nurses fielded no such driver-assault reports.That is, she said, ""we are not seeing"" the pattern ""any more.""Our rulingSupporters of the anti-proposition group wrote that Austin’s SAFE has seen in its offices ""sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month.""According to SAFE’s CEO, that count reflected what forensic nurses heard from victims over the last half of 2015. Separately, an Austin police tally of assault complaints tied to ride-hailed drivers might signal an even greater per-month average for that year.However, we learned, SAFE heard no such reports from sexual assault victims through the first three-plus months of 2016, perhaps a welcome indication that the pattern reported for 2015 hasn't persisted.On balance, we rate this claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Did Trump or his surrogates accuse Cruz of fraud in all these states?We remember that after Sen. Cruz prevailed over Trump in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, the New York businessman maintained that Cruz had deceived voters in part with misleading mailers about personal voting histories.We asked Luntz about the basis of all his bulleted states.On Twitter, Luntz said first that he didn’t have insider information. Then he guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, a website created for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. That’s a super PAC launched in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially another aspirant at the time, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to a Reuters news story.The post noted by Luntz touts the Trump Ballot Security Project which, the post says, is ""investigating hundreds of complaints of voter fraud in the Utah Republican Primary won by"" Cruz. The post also suggests fraud concerns in up to six additional states, starting with Cruz’s home state of Texas, whose GOP presidential primary he won.But, according to the post, the ballot-security project started ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case,"" the post says, ""votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio.""The group’s Texas claim is unsubstantiated, we found. Pants on Fire!After the Texas primary, stopthesteal.org’s post says, the group ""established a toll-free number to collect further reports of voter irregularities. Almost immediately,"" the post said, ""there were over 300 complaints from Oklahoma. Only a week later the Kansas and Maine caucuses brought hundreds of more complaints including claims of double-voting by"" Cruz ""supporters.""The post further says the project is ""analyzing voter irregularities in Ohio and Hawaii. The Trump Ballot Security Project is committed to investigating all complaints of voter fraud. In the event a pattern can be determined, the seating of these delegations can and will be challenged before the Credentials committee of the Republican National Convention. We have dispatched lawyers and election-law experts to all of the states mentioned above to investigate and document voter fraud.""From all that, we count seven states having or possibly having voting irregularities unhelpful to Trump: Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Maine -- with the Trump ballot-security project looking into fraud reports from Ohio and Hawaii.To be fair, the pro-Trump post explicitly names Cruz as the beneficiary (and possible miscreant) only in Texas, Kansas and Maine. Still, we spotted indications that Trump or his supporters have accused Cruz of wrongdoing in other states and heard as much directly from Stone.Other analysesFeatured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021The day we asked Luntz about his tweet, The Daily Wire -- which says its goal is to ""unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public  and devastate their funding bases"" -- posted a story laying out instances of Trump expressing dirty-trick concerns about pro-Cruz results in states including Louisiana and Wisconsin.Its story starts with mention of Trump’s complaint about the Cruz campaign in Iowa tweeting incorrect information about then-candidate Ben Carson. Next, the story describes Trump later asserting Cruz’s camp had illegally coordinated with an anti-Trump super PAC on a Utah Facebook ad showing Trump’s wife, Melania, once posing nude. That coordination charge recently came out False on the Truth-O-Meter.Also, The Daily Wire story noted, Trump posted a tweet threatening a lawsuit after the Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz might pick up as many as 10 additional delegates in Louisiana despite Trump drawing more votes in its primary. In April 2016, Trump told a Wisconsin crowd that even though he outpolled the field in the Pelican State, Cruz was garnering more delegates. ""It’s not fair, folks, it’s not fair,"" Trump said. ""Because I’m the outsider. What they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going.""According to a New Orleans Times-Picayune news story, Cruz had a chance after Louisiana’s balloting to pick up uncommitted delegates plus delegates who had committed to dropout Rubio. Meantime, Jason Doré, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said party officials would be prepared if Trump sued.The Daily Wire story also said that after Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement asserting an anti-Trump super PAC had coordinated its ads in the state with a pro-Cruz super PAC. In the statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Cruz was propelled to his win of the state by false advertising and he ""was coordinating with his own super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him,"" Hicks said.The Daily Wire story noted too that Stone said in an April 2, 2016, appearance on the online Breitbart News Saturday: ""Having worked very hard to collect evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Texas, frankly, they ought to put the handcuffs on him,"" referring to Cruz, ""because the Trump people can go to credentials,"" meaning the July 2016 Republican National Convention’s credentials panel, ""and challenge the seating of hundreds, literally hundreds of Ted Cruz’s delegates who were fraudulently elected.""""Go to StopTheSteal.org,"" Stone instructed. ""For over a month we have had an 800 number up, a toll-free number. We have collected and documented with sworn affidavits thousands of claims of voter irregularities in the states where Ted Cruz has won. And we’re prepared to present them to the credentials committee.""Summing up, then, that’s eight states either named by Trump or advocate Stone as having voting irregularities that helped Rubio or Cruz, not counting Ohio and Hawaii, where stopthesteal.org says Trump backers are still investigating.Stone: ‘Over 2,200 affidavits’Hoping for elaboration, we sent an email to Trump’s campaign and called the anti-fraud phone number on the group’s site. We didn't hear back from either.We had luck with Stone, though, who replied by email that the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness had no immediate plans to release what he described as over 2,200 affidavits documenting ""voter irregularities"" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona.Stone said the sworn statements would be submitted to the convention’s credentials panel if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel ""elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected"" through ""a pattern of voter fraud.""""Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign,"" Stone wrote.Stone was dismissive when we told him Republican party officials in Texas had told us they were unaware of any irregularities affecting the results in that state’s primary. ""Of course not,"" he wrote. ""Why would they admit it?""GOP officials: Nothing awryMike Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, had told us by phone that the party confirmed no irregularities in that state’s presidential primary. Also, our inquiries in a few other states, including searches of the Nexis news database, yielded no confirmed irregularities.At the Oklahoma Republican Party, spokesman Jake Parsons told us by phone there had been no irregularities in its March presidential primary or accusations by ""Team Trump"" against victor Cruz. Until we inquired, Parsons said, he hadn’t heard about any 300 phone calls (as mentioned on stopthesteal.org) suggesting pro-Cruz fraud. Parsons allowed, though, that individuals who failed to register as Republicans by a February 2016 deadline were upset at not being allowed to participate in the vote.""We actually have a great working relationship with the Trump and Cruz campaigns,"" Parsons said.We heard a similar refrain from Jason Savage, executive director of Maine’s Republican Party.""To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump's campaign,"" Savage said by email. ""In fact, we enjoyed working with Mr. Trump's campaign and the other presidential campaigns for our caucus. Our process was fair, secure and each campaign had access to exactly the same information and opportunities.""Savage said individuals ""may have voiced complaints from one side or another, but none of the presidential campaigns raised concerns over fraud.""In fact, I believe each of the campaigns praised our team's work and process in written or verbal form in the days following the caucus.Clayton Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said no Trump complaints have reached the party. Barker said he had seen Facebook posts suggesting busloads of Cruz supporters were able to vote in one county’s caucus and then hustle to vote in caucuses elsewhere but those were unconfirmed and, he said, party officials reviewed voter lists to ensure no one voted in separate caucuses.Our rulingLuntz said: ""Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud"" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin.Trump or Stone, his former campaign operative, have raised questions about the results in these states and more.But we didn’t identify ""Team Trump"" charges of fraud against Cruz in all the Luntz-listed states. The most pointed charges single out Cruz for supposedly misleading Iowa voters and later conspiring with super PACs in Utah and Wisconsin. Mentions of double-voting or unspecified ""irregularities"" in other states hint at a Cruz role without adding up to fraud accusations.On balance, we rate this claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

It passed unanimously in the Senate.The only Assembly member to comment on the resolution’s passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a ""warm and fuzzy feel-good bill"" only to be used for ""political benefit"" in future elections.""Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21,"" she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015.The resolution is straightforward. It’s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include ""earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship."" It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013.So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution ""pro-amnesty"" is harder to prove.In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman’s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as ""citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people.""Use of the word ""amnesty"" in immigration policy is contentious, and there’s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used.PolitiFact did look into use of the word ""amnesty"" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama’s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it’s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law.It’s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as ""amnesty"", but the resolution is just so vague that it’s difficult to call it ""pro-amnesty.""A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically charged word is ""debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation.""The resolution additionally doesn’t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, ""send a strong message to Congress"" to take up immigration reform.Nelson didn’t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community.Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher’s license in Nevada.And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee.Ultimately, there just isn’t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of ""symbolic"" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it’s almost entirely a federally managed issue.Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time.It’s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it’s difficult to tell if she’s present during the voice vote.That isn’t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman’s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote.Our rulingSeaman says Nelson voted ""yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country.""To be clear, the ""bill"" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly say it falls under the ""amnesty"" umbrella, and just doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate.We rate the claim Mostly True.","https://medium.com/@rileyjsnyder/recapping-the-erv-nelson-victoria-seaman-debate-2b4b9eeffb5f#.vbxxbkfd6,http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/nevada-has-top-share-unauthorized-immigrants,https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/Bill/2220/Overview,https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Bills/SJR/SJR21_EN.pdf,https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Votes/SJR15,https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PpDlhGJAYLyAZWE-FTiTPOMukpyVK1wsZUdN_RP2_c/edit?usp=sharing,https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/jim-demint/immigration-plan-enforcement-amnesty/,/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/,https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/,http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/,https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/Bill/1217/Overview,http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/,https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/Bill/1454/Overview,http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/,http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/dmv-nevada-has-issued-20000-plus-driving-cards-first-six-months,https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Minutes/Assembly/LOE/Final/1078.pdf,http://nvleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=14&clip_id=4815",,"Immigration,Nevada,Victoria Seaman",,,,,

Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same.""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte,"" McCrory said at a press conference Monday. ""Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago.""We’re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn’t answer it.The reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people.Carrboro also has a similar policy for contractors.A spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn’t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts ""any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public.""But he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn’t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn’t the right person to ask.Perhaps that’s because the law does invalidate those ordinances.""He’s completely wrong about that, unfortunately,"" said Carrboro’s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory’s claim that the law doesn’t take away any existing rights.Herman said the governor’s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors.""I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor – I give him all presumption of good faith – but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised,"" Herman said.More towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity.McCrory has also said those won’t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they’re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him.No more state claims for discriminationTaking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state – the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing.Featured Fact-checkBillboardstated on February 13, 2021 in a billboard“Gov Roy Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an under lying health issue!”By Paul Specht • February 17, 2021Such claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2.""This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein,"" the law states.""This is a seismic issue,"" said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. ""It’s huge. It’s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate.""Laura Noble, a Chapel Hill employment discrimination lawyer, agreed.""I won’t refer to this as a ‘bathroom bill’ because that's really not what it's about,"" she said. ""It’s about the elimination of discrimination protections.""The law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch’s Human Resource Commission.But Doggett said that group doesn’t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday.""There’s no remedy,"" he said. ""They have no teeth. … If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn’t mean anything if we can't enforce it.""Noble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it’s largely meaningless.""What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?"" She said.People can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts – less than six months, compared to three years – which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long.Debbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway.Our rulingMcCrory said that with the passage of HB2, ""we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina.""That is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask.And it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases.But even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong.We rate this claim False.

One focus of his talk involved condemning the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was a pact that gives ""the world’s leading state sponsor of terror"" $150 billion while the United States gets ""absolutely nothing in return.""""I’ve studied this issue in great detail — I would say actually greater by far than anybody else,"" Trump said. When the audience voiced skepticism he said, ""Believe me. Oh, believe me.""""The deal doesn’t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability,"" he said. ""Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, especially Israel.""Iran had not built a nuclear weapon at the time the deal was struck, so we wondered if Trump was correct in saying, ""when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go.""We emailed the Trump campaign looking for details, but didn't hear back.So we contacted other people who have also looked at the deal.It is correct that after 15 years, the limitations that prohibit Iran from enriching enough uranium to create a bomb will expire. We'll get into that in a moment.But to say that, at the 15-year mark, Iran will have a ready-to-go military nuclear capacity ignores the reality of creating that capability and ""simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association, which supports the deal.Various parts of the agreement expire at different times, as the following chart from the association shows.Yet some portions don't expire at all, such as the provision prohibiting Iran from conducting activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive. As long as it follows that part of the pact, it will never have nuclear weapons.But critics are focusing on elements of the deal that do expire. For example, the limit on the number of high-tech centrifuges needed to concentrate enough uranium to make a bomb goes away in 10 years. The requirements that uranium-235 be at a concentration no greater than 3.67 percent and that Iran have no more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium expire after 15 years. The concern is that, at that point, Iran would restart its nuclear weapons program.However, there would be nothing ""ready to go"" about their bomb or the delivery system needed to use it.At the time of the deal, the worst-case scenario was that Iran was two or three months from developing any type of nuclear bomb.Installing more and more sophisticated centrifuges ""would take at least several months,"" according to Matthew Kroenig of Georgetown University and a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign. He said it's true that once the enrichment limit is gone, that could set the stage for a nuclear weapon.""It is hard to know how long this would take because Iran never came clean on its past weaponization work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make covertly over the next 15 years. But again, several months is a reasonable assumption,"" he said.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021""Next, it would need to marry the warhead to its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in mounting conventional warheads on its already sizable ballistic missile stockpile, this should be a relatively routine matter, said Kroenig. ""So, in sum, after the limits expire, it would likely still take Iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon. But, the expansion of the enrichment program to ‘industrial size’ would be allowed at that point.""""To build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it would take several years,"" Kroenig said.""Iran will not have an industrial-sized nuclear capability, military or otherwise, when the deal ends at 10 to 15 years,"" said Richard Nephew of Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. The country had about 18,000 IR-1 centrifuges, most of which are dismantled and stored as part of the deal. As existing machines wear out, the stored ones can be brought out of mothballs to replace them. Iran would need about 50,000 to make fuel just for its nuclear power plant.""They won't go from 18,000 stored/operating centrifuges at year 10 to 15 to 50,000 over a weekend,"" he said.Kroenig said that if the intent is there, ""Iran can build as large and sophisticated an enrichment program as it would like, consistent with the terms of the deal. At that point there is very little other states could do to stop it from building nuclear weapons if it decides to do so.""But other experts we consulted said that's unlikely for a host of reasons.""U.S. intelligence concluded in 2007 that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003-04,"" and there is no indication the program was restarted, Nephew said.Then there are the permanent inspection requirements.""While Iran will be allowed to gradually expand its peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program after year 10, it must remain exactly that — a peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program,"" State Department spokesman Sem Werberg said in an email. ""If at any point in time — before 10 years, after 10 years, or at any point in the future — there is any evidence that Iran is 'militarizing' its nuclear program in any way, then it would be in violation of the deal AND its international commitments.""However, what the world would or could do about it at that point is a matter for debate.""Assuming that the Iranians are not cheating, then they couldn't have a 'military nuclear capability' ready to go ever,"" Nephew contended. ""In fact, provisions of the deal would preclude such a capability forever.""If Iran does decide to change course, supporters of the deal suspect that inspection and surveillance provisions of the deal will give other countries plenty of warning.""We will continue to have exquisite knowledge of how much uranium they have for 25 years because inspection of their mines and mills, will continue for 25 years. We will also know for 20 years how many centrifuge machines they will be producing where,"" said Kimball. ""To say there will be a military nuclear capability ready to go simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement.""""If Mr. Trump had studied the deal more than anyone else,"" Kimball continued, ""these facts would be apparent to him.""Our rulingTrump said, ""When those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go.""Key restrictions in the deal never expire, including the pledge to not conduct activities that would contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive.And even if Iran were to go all-out for a nuclear program once the 15-year limit on uranium enrichment goes away, it would take months, if not years, for the country to develop a bomb and delivery system so its military could go to war with nuclear weaponry.We rate the claim as False.","http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4586108/donald-trump-aipac,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/08/politifact-sheet-6-things-know-about-iran-nuclear-/,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/irans-unsung-plutonium-concession-in-nuclear-deal.html?_r=1,http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mhk32/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"National,Foreign Policy,Nuclear,Donald Trump",,,,,

""But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him.""A few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We’re putting O’Reilly’s specific claim that Garland voted ""to keep guns away from private citizens"" on the Truth-O-Meter.D.C. gun banO’Reilly’s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington’s gun regulations — essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home — were unconstitutional.This ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service.Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional.Based on O’Reilly’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion.Garland didn’t vote on this case at all.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case.It’s not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case.D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking them to send Heller back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School.""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Winkler said. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment.""We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked.The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an ""illegal national registration of gun owners,"" while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time.Our rulingO’Reilly said Merrick Garland ""voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens.""Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it.He voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but it’s impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case.We rate O’Reilly’s claim False.","http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/03/16/bill-oreilly-says-a-vote-merrick-garland-never/209336,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1iD255sUcU,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/16/conservative-media-have-settled-on-their-merrick-garland-narrative-hes-a-liberal-gun-snatcher/,https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/26/AR2008062600615.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090400474.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030902416.html,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,http://www.dcwatch.com/issues/gun070409.htm,http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/04-7041SCEN1039073.pdf,https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_35,http://www.fed-soc.org/experts/detail/a-raymond-randolph,http://armsandthelaw.com/archives/07-290tsacUnitedStates.pdf",,"Supreme Court,PunditFact,Guns,Bill O'Reilly",,,,,

This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.""",,politifact,,"U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders starts with the nation’s richest family when describing the magnitude of wealth inequality in the United States.""Today in America one family, the Walton family of Walmart. You all heard of Walmart. This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people,"" Sanders, I-Vt., said recently in Norfolk during a rally for his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.PolitiFact has looked at similar claims in the past from Sanders and other liberals, but the last time was in 2013. Since the statement has become a standard line in Sanders’ campaign speech, we decided to give it a new examination.The claim originates from research by Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California-Berkeley. She last updated her research in 2014.Allegretto tallied the total wealth held by the six relatives of Walmart founder Sam Walton: his sons Jim and Robert Walton; daughter Alice Walton; daughter-in-law Christy Walton; and his nieces, Ann Walton Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie.Using figures from the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans in 2013, Allegretto totaled the wealth of those six Waltons at $145 billion.Next, she turned to a survey of the net worth of Americans published every three years by the Federal Reserve. The most recent one was published in 2014 based on survey results from the previous year. The combined worth of the Walton clan in 2013, Allegretto said, ""equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43 percent.""We should point out that this is not a measure of ""income"" - the amount of money families earn every year.Instead, wealth is the bottom-line figure of a household’s ""net worth."" As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin pointed out in their 2013 fact-check, net worth is the amount left over after accounting for things such as savings and retirement accounts minus what’s owed on home mortgages, credit card bills and other debts.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021That means it’s entirely possible for someone earning a six-digit salary to be in the ""bottom 40 percent,"" because all their debts still could leave them with zero or even negative net worth.Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute free-market think tank in London, has been critical of comparing the Walton wealth to people of modest net worth. Worstall noted in a 2011 op-ed in Forbes that many high earners easily could fall into the category of zero or negative net worth, such as doctors still paying off loans from attending medical school.""If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket, you have more wealth than 25% of Americans. More than that 25% of Americans have collectively that is,"" Worstall wrote.Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington think tank, looked at the figure another way in a 2014 post. Noting that the Federal Reserve placed the median U.S. family wealth the previous year at $81,200, he wrote that it would take 1.7 million families with that amount of net worth to equal the wealth of the Waltons, he said.The Walton wealth has not been static since 2013. Forbes this year published figures showing the family’s wealth has declined to $121.9 billion -- a drop of $23.1 billion. Forbes explained it lowered the net worth held by Christy Walton after new information surfaced showing that her late husband, John - Sam Walton’s son - left some of his fortune to charity.We wondered whether that reduced $121.9 billion figure still would leave the Waltons’ wealth equal to about 40 percent of U.S. families. Allegretto was unavailable to run a new set computations for us.So we turned to the Urban Institute, a Washington non-profit specializing in economic social research.

Of the seven polls in 2016 that tested both Democratic candidates, Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six of them. (In one case, the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump beat both, but beat Sanders by slightly less.)Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts.Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.)""Very few Americans are making these comparisons yet, so opinion about these choices is likely to be weakly held, particularly for a large number of middle-of-the-road, independent, and disinterested Americans who are not participating in primaries and caucuses,"" said Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion.Smith added that early polls do not weed out ""likely voters,"" as polls later in the campaign do. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting.""If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons,"" Smith said. (He added that the same high level of first-time or irregular voters applies to Trump, but this should be less of a factor for Clinton, whose supporters skew older and more experienced than Sanders’ do.)Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agreed that ""national polls don’t have a great deal of predictive value this early in the campaign.""She pointed to research by Harry Enten, a polling analyst at the website fivethirtyeight.com.Enten found that since 1944, general election polls about a year before Election Day ""have only been weakly predictive of the eventual result."" He found that polls pitting the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees were, on average, off by more than 10 points from the eventual result.To cite just one example, Enten wrote that ""if you trusted the polls in late 1991, you might have thought Bill Clinton was finished in the 1992 presidential election. George H.W. Bush was ahead of Clinton by 21 percentage points at the time; Bush was basking in sky-high approval ratings after the first Gulf War. But as the Gulf War triumph faded and the economy became the focus of the campaign, Clinton would gain in the polls and eventually overtake Bush.""Our rulingSanders said that ""almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally.""On the numbers, Sanders is right. He runs stronger against Trump than Clinton in six of the seven national head-to-head polls since Jan. 1.

He hopes to expand kindergarten to 10,000 more children by 2020, calling it the most important investment Philadelphia can make to change schools’ academic outcomes.To help convince business leaders they can benefit from pre-K as well, he made this claim during a speech given to the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce: ""An economic impact study found that for every $1 invested in pre-K in Pennsylvania, a total of $1.79 is generated in total spending within the state.""    Kenney has used the statistic before, and David L. Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, also cited it in a recent editorial. Is it legitimate?   Kenney’s communications director, Lauren Hitt, said Kenney got the statistic from the Economy League, which used a study from ReadyNation/America’s Edge, an organization with a goal of strengthening business ""through better policies for children and youth."" Cohen specifically mentioned the same study in his editorial.The study examines the total dollar effect of $1 in pre-K spending on the state’s output. Using a tool called the IMPLAN model, it theorizes that the money spent on pre-kindergarten would lead to new learning centers and new teachers and staff. Those new learning centers would spend locally on supplies and other resources for the pre-K programs, and the teachers would spend the money on food, clothes, restaurants and whatever else they’d need. The businesses would in turn hire more people to meet the increased demand. The estimated economic effect would be an additional 79 cents generated in the economy per dollar spent on pre-k for a total of $1.79.Tim Bartik, author of ""Investing in Kids: Early Childhood Programs and Local Economic Development"" said the study’s estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending is probably high because it doesn’t take possible tax increases into account, which is the way many early childhood education programs are financed. Kenney hopes to fund the annual $60 million to fund pre-K through a soda tax. Bartik said the likely effect of $1 on pre-K spending, given a tax increase, would be the dollar spent for pre-K and perhaps a little extra.""I could imagine it being greater than a dollar,"" said Bartik, who is also a senior economist for the Upjohn Institute and has received a research grant from ReadyNation. ""How much greater I couldn’t say. It would be a lot of work to get the right answer.""  He said the estimated impact of an extra 79 cents for every dollar spent was not likely unless the pre-kindergarten program was privately financed.Steve Doster, the Pennsylvania director for ReadyNation/America’s Edge, confirmed the study did not take into account how each $1 spent on pre-K would be raised, such as through an increase of taxes.  Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021""When this report was generated it was generated looking at significant public investment from Pennsylvania,"" Doster said.This doesn’t mean expanded pre-K couldn’t have major benefits. In fact, Bartik said the total economic impact from $1 of pre-K spending could be as much as $3 to $5. But that estimate would include benefits from freeing the time of parents of pre-kindergarten students who could work more hours or gain more skills, the possibility of increased earnings of pre-kindergarten students years down the line and the spillover effects from both of those scenarios. The study being referenced by Kenney and Cohen -- and that would be of most interest to the business community -- is about the short run, the total dollar impact of one dollar spent on pre-kindergarten on the state output.   Ron Haskins said there hasn’t been much other research to back the estimates laid out in the ReadyNation/America’s Edge study but reaffirmed what Bartik and several other studies have pointed out in terms of overall economic benefits. No matter what kind of positive economic effect is being predicted, the total would depend on the unknown: the quality of the program. For pre-kindergarten to pay off for businesses or children, it must provide a good education across the board.  ""I want to emphasize,"" Haskins said. ""Without quality, forget the 79 cents.""Our rulingMayor Jim Kenney cited a study saying every dollar spent on pre-k education in Pennsylvania would yield $1.79 for the state economy. Comcast’s David L. Cohen noted the same study in an editorial.  While studies and experts agree the economic impact of quality pre-kindergarten programs could be substantial, the study pointed out by Kenney is about shorter-term effects on the state’s output. Taxes required to pay for the pre-K program could lessen the economic effect, adding up to less than an extra 79 cents per dollar spent.  But research and expert opinion illustrate quality pre-K likely will have a substantial, positive effect on the local economy.  We rule the claim Half True.","http://articles.philly.com/2015-04-01/news/60686763_1_education-plan-jim-kenney-school-system,http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thinktank/Philly-businesses-back-Kenney-on-pre-K-funding.html,http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/newsroom/2014/08/15/pre-k-benefits-all-of-us-not-just-the-kids,http://www.prekforpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PA-Multiplier-Report-4-25-14.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/",,"Education,Pennsylvania,Jim Kenney",,,,,

""It is the great economic issue of our time and the great political issue of our time. Truthfully, there is something profoundly wrong when the richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population, 3.5 billion people.""That’s an astounding fact, if true, that 80 people own as much wealth as 3.5 billion. We decided to see if Sanders was right.He largely is.Sanders relied on a 2014 analysis from Oxfam, which came up with the comparison from two different reports.The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires.We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats. The Credit Suisse reportAnalysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $263 trillion. From there, analysts estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .72 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.7 trillion.James Davies, one of the report’s lead authors and an economist at the University of Western Ontario, said no one else has done this exact study. That’s true, but the Allianz Group, another global financial corporation, and the Boston Consulting Group, a financial and management consulting firm, have estimates of total household financial wealth that are pretty close to what Credit Suisse reported.Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, told us both his firm and Credit Suisse used much of the same data, but Credit Suisse included more countries. Beardsley said that difference wouldn’t be significant.Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries. But even if true, it wouldn’t throw off Sanders’ comparison much. Santaeulalia-Llopis said Sanders and Oxfam might need to add a few more billionaires to their tally to make it more accurate.The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, Beardsley said.""(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,"" Beardsley said. ""In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth --  is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty.""Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021However, this doesn’t challenge the underlying numbers. Instead, it raises a question about interpreting them. Economist Branko Milanovic, formerly with the World Bank and now at City University of New York Graduate Center, countered in a blog post that sometimes, a negative net worth is a very big deal.""Even for those people in the rich world who are ‘anomalously’ placed among the wealth-poor and who may lead nice lives despite owning nothing, a shock in the form of a medical emergency  -- unless there is public health care -- or loss of job may have catastrophic consequences,"" Milanovic wrote. ""There is just no wealth to fall back on to tide you over the bad times.""Forbes billionaire estimatesThe second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward.Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.7 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population.Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off because far from all the necessary information is public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market.The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate.One final noteThe divide between the super rich and the bottom of the global population appears to be getting worse.Credit Suisse, Forbes and Oxfam update their numbers at least every year and for 2015, Oxfam said just 62 billionaires own as much as half the world’s people combined.The Sanders campaign, however, told us the video was shot before the latest Oxfam report. So we won't hold it against Sanders in our rating.Our rulingSanders said that 80 people own as much as half the world’s population. The statement was in line with the latest Oxfam report available at the time Sanders spoke. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires.The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 80 that Sanders said, or the 62 that Oxfam said more recently.  But out of world population of 7 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 160. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world.The statement is accurate but needs additional information.

The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.""",,politifact,,"During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he’d made several times before.""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,"" Trump said. ""The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.""Actually, Trump’s the one who shouldn’t be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate.To understand why, let’s start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008.Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren’t looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don’t feel they have a shot in the current job market.To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls ""labor underutilization."" This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand ""U-6.""The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially ""unemployed"" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that’s also its lowest level since May 2008.It’s possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument.But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the ""real"" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent.Why? He’s including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let’s explore this point further.The source of Trump’s 42 percent figure appears to be a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director.Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a ""plausible measure of the potential workforce."" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you run the numbers, ""the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,"" Stockman wrote.Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.""Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,"" he wrote. ""We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else.""Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.Stockman’s calculation ""treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all.""In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no.To see why, let’s start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million ""non-working"" Americans.We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work.• People age 16 to 19 who are not in the labor force: Subtract 10.8 million• People age 65 and up who are not in the labor force: Subtract 38.4 million• Students, age 20-24: Subtract 8.7 million• Students, age 25-29: Subtract 2.9 million• Students, age 30-34: Subtract 1.4 million• Stay-at-home moms: Subtract 10.4 million• Stay at-home dads: Subtract 2 million• Those receiving disability checks: Subtract 8.9 millionSo what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working.If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of ""unemployment"" rate -- call it ""U-7"" if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it’s only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.This isn’t a perfect calculation. There’s probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren’t working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn’t get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65.Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump’s claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent.There’s even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being ""out of work"" by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term ""jobless,"" he said, ""is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits.""Our rulingTrump said, ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.""While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That’s far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent.

Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout.""With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success,’ "" the post says. ""With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a ‘lousy deal.’ ""The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot like an attack PolitiFact Ohio checked out in the 2010 governor’s race against Republican John Kasich. Strickland’s campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Strickland’s claim rated False.)We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs.NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTA’s fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas.Portman indeed called NAFTA a ""proven success"" when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 news release. The news release didn’t say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging.  Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tank Public Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader. The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, the Economic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 19, 2021 in a Facebook post“Oil is now $61.30 a barrel and rising drastically! On Jan. 5, it was about $25 a barrel.”By Tom Kertscher • February 24, 2021In the report, Public Citizen claims, ""Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect."" (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000 in a revised version.)But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. ""More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA,"" the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA.Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesn’t, or can’t, explain.In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be ""associated with movement of work outside of the country.""Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohio’s dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent.Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged ""largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments.""Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line.In other words, the effects of NAFTA can’t be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the state’s economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report about NAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, ""NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment.""Our rulingStrickland said, ""With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success.’ ""The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon.

Marco Rubio of Florida has tried to distance himself from his involvement in a 2013 failed bipartisan immigration bill.The legislation has proven to be a liability for Rubio because it contained a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and some of Rubio’s opponents say his support for the bill is evidence that he’s not tough on immigration. On NBC’s Meet the Press Jan. 31, host Chuck Todd asked Rubio if he regretted being part of the Gang of Eight senators who authored the bill.""Look, I tried to fix the problem,"" Rubio said, referring to illegal immigration.

We found that the latest available data doesn’t support Rubio’s statement.A July 2015 headline from the Pew Research Center directly counters Rubio that there are more illegal immigrants than five years ago: ""Unauthorized immigrant population stable for half a decade.""Pew found that the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has seen very little fluctuation, between 2010 and 2014, the latest five-year period of data available — going from 11.4 million in 2010 to 11.3 million in 2014. The illegal immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007. (See the chart created by Pew to the left.)The Pew analysis concluded that the illegal immigrant population has been stable the past few years because the number of new immigrants is about equal to the number of those living in the United States who are deported, leave on their own, or die.Pew also found that the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, in particular, has been on the decline — going from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2014.The decline in Mexican immigrants is the primary reason why illegal immigration stopped growing, said Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies. He pointed us to his own recent research on the subject.The report’s executive summary says illegal immigration is a hot political topic, in part, because people believe it’s on the rise. However, the paper finds that ""this belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been decreasing for more than a half a decade.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce.He said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop in total apprehensions of about 40 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped around a million people coming in from Mexico per year. Last year, it was about 188,000.More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said.Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left.Our rulingRubio said, ""We have more illegal immigrants here"" than we did five years ago.Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11.3 million in 2014, down from 11.4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increases throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.There is no evidence to support the idea that the illegal immigrant population has grown in the past five years.

Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021Feinstein on gunsFeinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons.It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress.Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994.Video of Feinstein’s commentIn an interview with 60 Minutes that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict.Feinstein responded: ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.’""Cruz’s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful’s claim. It’s available on YouTube as a short excerpt of the longer 60 Minutes piece. The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term ""assault weapon"" is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference.Nowhere in the short piece or the full interview does Feinstein discuss banning ""all guns"" as Cruz claimed.Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all assault weapons, regardless of when they were made.She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the 60 Minutes interview, in December 1995:""If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that,"" she said, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record.Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban.""Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right,"" Feinstein wrote in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle in July 2012.Our rulingCruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans ""I want all of your guns,"" or ""I'm rounding 'em up.""When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz’s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a 60 Minutes piece that centered on Feinstein’s assault weapons ban from two decades ago.While Feinstein calls for an ""outright ban"" in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full 60 Minutes interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning ""all guns.""Instead, she’s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons. The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein’s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole.We rate Cruz’s claim False.","https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/07/politics/ted-cruz-obama-guns/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzb9Hs2SmfQ,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/blog-posting/no-facebook-didnt-try-shut-down-gavin-newsom-recal/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_LaBJvI0BI&app=desktop,https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzEw5kVPFEwJ:ibgwww.colorado.edu/~wilsonsm/feinstein.ps,https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/s18307-1,http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Feinstein-presses-for-assault-weapons-ban-3741632.php",,"California,Guns,Ted Cruz",,,,,

""A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.""Quite a few readers flagged Obama’s claim that a violent felon can buy a gun online without a background check, so we decided to fact-check it.Some readers seemed to think Obama was suggesting such transactions were legal. We don’t see that in Obama’s comments. (The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said ""can,"" not ""may."") To be clear, such a transaction would be illegal. What Obama said is that such transactions are possible. That is accurate, but it’s also a little more complicated than Obama’s comment suggests.A big loopholeFederal law prohibits felons from purchasing or receiving guns unless their rights have been formally restored. However, felons can get around this obstacle by buying guns from sellers who do not require criminal background checks.""Violent felons aren't allowed to buy guns, period,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""But they can take advantage of the loophole in federal law that allows gun sales, including some gun sales over the Internet, to purchase from non-licensed sellers, who don't have to conduct a background check.""Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun.But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. If an individual buys a gun from someone who does not have or require a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check.So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show.There are a couple of important limitations on these sorts of online private transactions.First, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person.Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically.In its own 2013 review of Armslist and similar sites, the New York Times found that these sites ""function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them.""Their investigation identified several individuals with criminal backgrounds buying and selling firearms over the Internet.Still, only a small slice of gun purchases take place online. In a December Quinnipiac poll, just 3 percent of gun owners said they obtained a gun from an online seller.Obama’s statement ""rings true,"" said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University.""Since our goal is to keep guns from the hands of criminals, it doesn't make sense that if you go to a store to buy a gun you have to go through a background check,"" Donohue said, ""But if you buy the exact same gun on the Internet from a private seller, you don't have to go through a background check.""Winkler said Obama’s proposed executive action won’t do much to curb these kinds of transactions, though, ""because the loophole is baked into federal law.""Regarding background checks, Obama has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to ""clarify"" that anyone ""engaged in the business of dealing in firearms"" needs a license — meaning self-described hobbyists who regularly sell guns, rather than just occasionally, might be violating the law by operating without a license.But this doesn’t directly stop felons from buying guns from private sellers who don’t have a license and don’t require purchasers to undergo background checks.Our rulingObama said, ""A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.""The kind of transaction Obama described is possible, though illegal, and more complicated than his comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they can purchase guns from private sellers over the Internet without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. That seller would have to be in the same state as the buyer.We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.Editor's note: This fact-check has been updated to add details about how Internet-facilitated gun sales take place.  Share the Facts   Politifact    2 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  ""A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.""

André Carson, D-Ind., aimed to rebut the notion that American Muslims pose much of a risk. Carson said on ABC News’ This Week on Dec. 13 that one neo-Nazi group was using the recent San Bernardino shooting as a ""call to action.""""The rhetoric that we're seeing, it concerns me,"" Carson said. ""I think most of our largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups. I’ve worked in counterterrorism; I know this to be a fact.""But Carson's statement about ""racial supremacist groups"" posing a larger threat than jihadists isn't cleanly supported by the data that he cites.Carson spokeswoman Jessica Gail said Carson based his assessment on a range of information. ""The congressman believes that when looking at relative membership numbers, hateful rhetoric, racially based hate crimes, and fatalities by right-wing organizations, it paints a picture of a larger threat to the safety of Americans and society as a whole,"" Gail said.Gail noted the FBI reported that in 2014, 47 percent of hate crimes were racially motivated. But hate crimes include a range of offenses. Violations such as vandalism and intimidation -- a racial slur for example -- represent over half of all hate crimes based on race. While both are bad, the average person wouldn't put them in the same category as an attack by an Islamic extremist.Gail also cited work by the New America Foundation, which keeps a running count of fatal attacks on U.S. soil by ""homegrown extremists"" (it does not count people who were injured in attacks but did not die).The foundation breaks the attacks down into two categories for comparison, ""violent jihadist attacks"" and ""far right-wing attacks.""As for what the latter category includes, the foundation's summaries of each fatal incident describe assailants motivated by anti-government or anti-abortion beliefs. (We've previously noted how conservatives have said the analysis wrongly attributed some of the killings to right-wing zealots when the ideological connection was weak.)Jihadists had killed 45 people as of mid December. Non-jihadist extremists, in the foundation’s view, claimed the lives of 48. The totals go back to just after the 9/11 attacks and include the recent deaths in San Bernadino, Calif., as well as those slain at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado.David Sterman, who oversees the New American project, downplays the slight numerical edge attributed to far non-jihadist violence.""Future attacks could certainly change which category has killed more people,"" Sterman told us. ""However, the crucial point is not which group has killed more in any particular moment, but that the threat from both streams of extremist thought is very similar in death toll despite a narrative that views jihadist terrorism as having been vastly more deadly inside the U.S.""Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021That might suggest that Carson was technically correct but perhaps overstated his case. However, Carson runs into trouble because he specified ""racial supremacist groups.""In the New American database, only about half of the murders committed by the non-jihadist extremists' side of the ledger were tied to anger directed against any race or ethnic group. Just as often, the killers had expressed anti-government or anti-abortion views.For example, according to the database, the slaying of two police officers in Louisiana in 2012 was committed by members of the Sovereign Citizens movement. Adherents believe that they are not bound by any law passed by the government. The Southern Policy Law Center reports that followers include many blacks.Sterman confirmed that race-based attacks are a subset of the total.Once we factor this in, the foundation’s data set does not provide support for Carson’s statement.Another measure of threatResearchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University took a different approach to gauging which groups present the biggest risk to the public. Charles Kurzman, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and David Schanzer, a public policy professor at Duke University, went to the law enforcement community.In early 2014, they surveyed nearly 400 law enforcement officers across the country. They asked them to compare the threats from al-Qaida-inspired extremism and an umbrella category for extremism that includes anti-government, racist, anti-capitalist and other motivations.By a 2-1 margin, the officers put the threat of other extremists over that of jihadists. About 74 percent ranked anti-government driven violence among their top three concerns, while a bit under 40 percent put al-Qaida related extremists in their top three.Kurzman told us these results would not support Carson’s statement because ""we did not distinguish white supremacists from other forms of non-Islamic violent extremism in our June 2015 report.""And he noted that further analysis, set to be released in 2016, shows that more law enforcement agencies rank al-Qaida-inspired violence as a higher risk than racist extremism by a margin of 39 percent to 24 percent.Our rulingCarson said that the nation’s largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups, adding that he knew this to be a fact. His spokeswoman said that is based on his compilation of various trends and reports.

""Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad, and 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to shariah.""There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we decided to focus on Trump’s claim that 25 percent of Muslims polled by the Center for Security Policy agree that global jihad justifies violence against Americans.While the study Trump cited does exist, it’s not at all clear that it supports his argument that ""there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population."" There are several important problems with the survey that call into question whether the results are representative of the entire U.S. Muslim population.Trump’s pollThe Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank, surveyed 600 Muslims and released findings in June under the headline, ""Poll of U.S. Muslims Reveals Ominous Levels Of Support For Islamic Supremacists’ Doctrine of Shariah, Jihad.""Among the findings is 25 percent of respondents agreed either slightly or strongly with the statement ""Violence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad."" About 64 percent disagreed.The first problem with the Center for Security policy poll has to do with methodology. It was an online, opt-in survey, which tend to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. In traditional polling methods, everyone in a population has a chance of being selected for the survey, meaning the results generally reflect the country’s demographics.Numerous respected polling groups, like Survey Monkey, use opt-in surveys, said Christopher C. Hull, a former adjunct professor at Georgetown University who now works with the Center for Security Policy and answered an inquiry from PolitiFact on the group’s behalf. He added that the method is useful for reaching small populations, such as U.S. Muslims, who only make up about 1 percent of the population.Hull did caution, however, that ""one cannot extrapolate directly from an online, opt-in survey to the broader U.S. population.""One notable finding buried in the full survey data: It found that 23 percent of the U.S. Muslims surveyed said they are ""not at all familiar with"" the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, and 18 percent said they are not familiar with al-Qaida. Experts said it seems illogical that such a large percentage of American Muslims would not have knowledge of the two groups.""The al-Qaida number seems entirely implausible and likely a canary in a coal mine as to the unrepresentativeness of this survey,"" said David Dutwin, executive vice president and chief methodologist at SSRS, a research firm.There may be further problems with the poll, including the reality that many American Muslims are immigrants and not fluent in English, and that the survey asked leading questions with limited response choices, according to a critique by the Washington Post’s Philip Bump.It’s also worth noting that the head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has articulated a variety of theories about Muslim extremists that verge on conspiracy, such as the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the United States government and the false narrative that President Barack Obama is Muslim.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Robert Oldendick, executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina, reviewed the survey methodology made available by the Center for Security Policy but said he still didn’t have enough information to assess whether it’s a good or bad poll. The group has not disclosed how the surveyors targeted participants and what the response rate was.""I would view these results very cautiously,"" Oldendick said. ""It may be right, but it may not be. But the information to identify the quality of the sample is just not there.""Compared with PewTrump also mentioned research by the Pew Research Center as support for his proposal.On a key point, the results of the Center for Security Policy study diverge from the results of a 2011 Pew Research study, a traditional telephone survey of 1,033 U.S. Muslims. The methodology of the Pew poll, and the organization’s reputation, is considered solid by public-opinion experts.The Pew survey asked whether ""suicide bombing/other violence against civilians is justified to defend Islam from its enemies."" Just 1 percent said it is ""often"" justified, while 12 percent said it is ""sometimes"" or ""rarely"" justified. Eighty-one percent said it is ""never"" justified.According to Pew in 2011, about 13 percent of American Muslims said they believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. That’s half the rate of the Center for Security Policy finding of 25 percent.The 2011 Pew study also found that a ""significant minority"" -- 21 percent -- of American Muslims feel that there is a great deal or a fair amount of support for extremism in the American Muslim community.The Center for Security Policy survey results do not directly back up Trump’s proposal to stop Muslims from entering the United States, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Polling Company, which conducted the survey on the center’s behalf.""We did not -- nor would we -- ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims,"" she said.The Center for Security Policy poll has touched a nerve because it ""asked questions that other polling firms are refusing to ask,"" Hull said, defending the results.""When people do not like the results of a poll, they attack the poll’s methodology and sponsor,"" he said. ""This situation is no different.""Our rulingTrump said that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims ""agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad.""Trump is referring to a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy. However, polling experts raise numerous questions about the validity of the poll’s results, including its ""opt-in"" methodology and the dubiously large percentages of respondents who said they were unaware of ISIS or al-Qaida. Moreover, an official with the Center for Security Policy cautioned against generalizing the poll results to the entire Muslim-American community.Another survey, which experts consider credible, found levels about half as high as what the Center for Security Policy poll found.We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.","http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/E11D/production/_87092675_000001atrump.jpg,https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/23/nationwide-poll-of-us-muslims-shows-thousands-support-shariah-jihad/,http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trumps-call-to-ban-muslims-from-coming-to-the-u-s-has-a-very-bad-poll-at-its-center/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/08/meet-frank-gaffney-the-anti-muslim-gadfly-who-produced-donald-trumps-anti-muslim-poll/,http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/143836/muslim-brotherhood-obama-administration-frank-gaffney,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/9/americas-first-muslim-president/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/Muslim%20American%20Report%2010-02-12%20fix.pdf",,"National,Islam,Polls and Public Opinion,Religion,Terrorism,Donald Trump",,,,,

Hewitt told Cruz that he’d been doing anti-abortion events for 25 years and had never met ""a single pro-life activist who is in favor of violence of any sort.""Cruz agreed. ""And I would note that this whole episode has really displayed the ugly underbelly of the media,"" Cruz said. ""You know, every time you have some sort of violent crime or mass killing, you can almost see the media salivating, hoping, hoping desperately that the murderer happens to be a Republican, so they can use it to try to paint their political enemies. Now listen, here’s the simple and undeniable fact. The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats. The media doesn’t report that.""We received dozens of emails from readers asking us to check the claim, so we took a closer look.We queried the Cruz campaign, but didn’t hear back. CNN reported that Cruz’s campaign, when asked, cited research by two academics, Marc Meredith, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Michael Morse, then of Stanford University. They published a paper in the January 2014 edition of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science titled, ""Do Voting Rights Notification Laws Increase Ex-Felon Turnout?"" (After we published our item, Cruz defended the statement to ABC News on the basis of that study.)The paper looked at the policy in some states of notifying newly released inmates about their ability to re-register to vote. The authors looked at data from New Mexico, New York and North Carolina and concluded that notification laws do not significantly increase rates of registration or voting among ex-felons.Cruz’s claim relies not on the general thrust of the paper but on some of the data contained within it.For instance, in New York, about one-third of felons released from prison registered to vote after their release. Of those, about 62 percent registered as Democrats and 9 percent registered as Republicans, with 26 percent registering as independents or with other parties.In North Carolina, about a quarter of those who were released registered after their release. Of those, 52 percent registered as Democrats, 19 percent as Republicans and 22 percent as independents or with other parties.And in New Mexico, 41 percent of those who were released registered to vote. Of those, 55 percent registered as Democrats, 10 percent as Republicans and 18 percent as independents or with other parties.So Cruz’s statement has some grounding in the research. But it significantly oversimplifies the case -- and introduces some inaccuracies.""Cruz is misinterpreting our research,"" the authors told PolitiFact.Here’s a rundown of factors that should give anyone pause:Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021• ""Violent"" vs. ""nonviolent."" Cruz said that ""the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats."" But the paper didn’t break down their pool of ex-felons into those who had been incarcerated for violent offenses and those who had been incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. So the paper contains no support for this portion of Cruz’s claim.• A small sample of states. The paper focuses on three states out of 50, and the authors say it’s wrong to generalize from this small sample. In fact, in another academic paper, the same authors found that in Iowa, Maine and Rhode Island, the most common registration for discharged felons was not to affiliate with any party.""Ex-felons’ partisan affiliations vary across states, and we don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that the national ex-felon population is ‘overwhelmingly Democratic,’ at least in terms of party registration,"" the authors told us.• The paper studied ""ex-felons,"" not ""criminals."" Cruz’s statement makes it sound as if Democrats are committing crimes. That’s not what the paper measured. Rather, the paper found that once felons are released from prison, they are likelier to register as Democrats. The data in the paper doesn’t speak to whether they were Democrats (registered or otherwise) when committing crimes.• The study doesn’t address ex-felons who don’t register to vote. Half to two-thirds of the voters in these states didn’t register to vote.• It’s hard to separate these figures from overall demographics. It’s no secret that, statistically, African-Americans are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. It’s also no secret that African-Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic. Put these two together and it’s not surprising to find higher percentages of Democratic registrations among ex-felons.Indeed, in a 2010 paper -- ""Did Disfranchisement Laws Help Elect President Bush? New Evidence on the Turnout Rates and Candidate Preferences of Florida’s Ex-Felons"" -- Traci Burch of Northwestern University found that African-American ex-felons did overwhelmingly register as Democrats. But the paper also found that white ex-felons did not follow the same pattern.Meredith and Morse said they have looked at updates of the data Birch studied and found that while African-American ex-felons still overwhelmingly identify as Democratic, non-African-Americans were only slightly more likely to identify as a Democrat than as a Republican.• Correlation is not necessarily causation. As we indicated above, it could be that high Democratic registration rates are inevitable results of a criminal justice system stacked against African-Americans. It's even possible that inmates’ experience in prison could ""turn"" an ex-felon Democratic. Perhaps ex-felons simply don’t like what they see as the Republican approach to criminal-justice policy.The bottom line is, despite Cruz’s belief that this is a ""simple and undeniable fact,"" there are enough asterisks with this statement to make it anything but.Our rulingCruz said, ""Here’s the simple and undeniable fact: The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats.""Research cited by the Cruz campaign supports the claim that, in at least three states, felons released from prison go on to register as Democrats at a disproportionately high rate following their release.However, there are important caveats. The study in question looked at both violent and nonviolent felons without separating out those two groups. It’s not clear whether the patterns holds in the other 47 states. Also, the study didn’t look at active ""criminals"" but rather those who had already served their time. Finally, it’s hard to draw a line between cause and effect, particularly given the disproportionately high population of African-Americans -- a traditionally Democratic group -- in the criminal justice system.We rate his statement Mostly False.","http://www.hughhewitt.com/senator-ted-cruz-planned-parenthood-attacks-freedom-act-2016-illegal-immigration/#more-29524,http://ann.sagepub.com/content/651/1/220.abstract,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/cruz-reasonable-inference-majority-violent-criminals-democrats-35521341,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~marcmere/workingpapers/IowaFelons.pdf",,"National,Criminal Justice,Legal Issues,Crime,Ted Cruz",,,,,

But the same report said those rumors were ""unfounded.""The Washington Post, on Sept. 18, 2001, published an article that claimed ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.""

But there is no conclusive evidence that any New Jersey residents celebrated the attacks, and there is no evidence whatsoever of any demonstrations where ""thousands and thousands of people"" cheered.Nor is there any evidence Trump saw these events play out in any way, be it on TV or in person. We reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back.What we did find are many stories of Muslims living in New Jersey speaking out against the attacks and bracing themselves for anti-Muslim backlash.

Will Hurd is a target. Pete Gallego, an Alpine Democrat who represented the district before losing his seat to Hurd by a narrow margin in 2014, went on the attack, telling the Texas Tribune, ""One of my biggest disappointments in watching Will is that Will tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record. He’s a follower.""In much of Texas, loyalty to the GOP is hardly a liability. But the situation is a little more complicated in the 23rd, a swing district in the state, and the only one expected to see a real contest in the 2016 general election.Following a 2003 Republican redistricting that found the district be in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court ordered the district to be re-drawn in 2006. Minority rights and civil rights groups have challenged a most recent 2011 Republican redistricting for congressional seats, claiming lines drawn in the 23rd dilute minority voting strength. The district stretches west from San Antonio almost to El Paso, incorporating a large swath of Texas’ border with Mexico.The competitive nature of the district has resulted in three representatives in as many election cycles. The non-partisan Congressional Quarterly and the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report have both identified Hurd’s seat as one of the top 10 ""toss-up"" House seats up for grabs in 2016. In other words, the 23rd is a district in which blind partisanship could conceivably be an impediment to re-election.We were curious whether the 96 percent figure Gallego cited was literally true, or just hyperbole — and whether that number is unusually high — so we took a closer look at Hurd’s voting record.Anthony Gutierrez, the communications representative for Gallego, confirmed that the 96 percent figure was pulled from Hurd’s score by CQ Roll Call. The week Gallego’s comments were made, the number calculated by CQ was actually 96.4 percent, to be exact, although the number fluctuates constantly because it is based on numbers from the current legislative session. As of Nov. 6, 2015, it had fallen to 95.6 percent.It’s also important to put these numbers in context. During his term, Hurd has voted with the party a greater percentage of the time than the Republican average across the House over the same time period, 93.6 percent, but he diverges more often than 17 of his 24 fellow Texas Republicans, a group that has voted with the party an average of 97.4 percent of the time in party unity votes during the 114th Congress.Based on voting in the current legislative session, five of the 10 most party-loyal Republicans in the House are from Texas. Hurd was not among them.Across the aisle, the 11 Texas Democrats in the House have voted with their party 89.6 percent of the time during the 114th Congress, 92.1 percent of the time on party unity votes. If you average the percentage of the time each has voted with their party considering all terms, not just the current one, that number comes up to 92.6 percent. The spread in their voting records is also much bigger compared with the Texas GOP. The most loyal voter, the 35th District’s Lloyd Doggett, has voted with the Democrats 97.9 percent of the time in party unity votes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 28th’s Henry Cuellar sides with the party in only 69.5 percent party unity votes votes. While it’s not strictly relevant to the truth value of Gallego’s claim about Hurd, all this begs the question of Gallego’s own voting record during his tenure in the House. During Gallego’s time in Congress, he voted with his party 81 percent of the time, according to Open Congress voting records. Of course, this number can’t be directly compared with the 89.6 percent average mentioned above for Texas Democrats in the House, because that figure is for the current session, not the one Gallego served. In the interest of comparing apples to apples, we calculated how frequently Gallego’s fellow Texas Democrats in the House voted with their party during his term. The average came out to a slightly more modest 86.2 percent.Featured Fact-check Kevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021Gallego was the only one-term Democratic representative from Texas in the 113th Congress, which means that for every other representative, we can compare the percentage of the time they voted with the party during that term to the percentage of the time they voted with the party in all votes over the course of their multi-term career. If we do that, we see that all but one broke with the party more often than average that term. So while Gallego still broke with the party more often than average, it was a Congress in which Texas Democrats in general voted with the party less consistently than usual.Responding by email, Hurd’s campaign manager Justin Hollis did not dispute the voting record. He leveled his own criticism of Gallego.  ""It took Pete Gallego losing in 2014 to finally become interested in the legislative process.""It’s worth keeping in mind that since CQ and Open Congress data don’t weigh votes by importance, the numbers don’t tell the full story as far as whether a representative’s votes against the party are on substantive issues or minor procedural matters. But then again, Gallego never claimed to have the full story.Our rulingPete Gallego said Will Hurd ""tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record.""At the time of the statement, Pete Gallego’s claim and the percentage were consistent with Hurd’s voting record.We rate this claim True.TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","http://rothenberggonzales.com/ratings/house,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/kevin-mccarthy/3-times-kevin-mccarthy-has-talked-about-qanon/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/",,"Bipartisanship,Congress,Redistricting,Voting Record,Texas,Pete Gallego",,,,,

Republican critics of the president’s signature health care law have focused on these failures.But a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, Zeke Emanuel, brother of President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, downplayed the bad news on MSNBC.""When you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed,"" Emanuel said on Nov. 3, 2015. ""The idea that some of these co-ops are going to work and some aren’t should be expected. That's what business is about. The idea that 100 percent will succeed is a false metric we don't hold the private sector to.""We decided to dig into Emanuel’s notion that a 50-percent failure rate after five years for businesses applies to these insurance co-ops.Where the co-ops came fromWhen Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included $6 billion in loans to launch Consumer Owned and Oriented Plans. The vision was to create nonprofit health insurance companies that would provide low-cost, high quality policies to individuals and small businesses. Without the need to produce a return on investment, these enterprises would, in theory, be able to compete against the major generally for-profit players in the market. In fact, in places where competition was scant, these co-ops would help the market deliver better value for all consumers.Throughout 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department approved loans to get the co-ops up and running. After a series of budget cuts, program funding was capped at $2.4 billion.In 2013, the co-ops began selling policies to provide coverage in 2014.The dates are important because it’s doubtful any of these co-ops were five years old as of 2015. If they weren’t five years old, then Emanuel’s benchmark might not be as suitable as he suggested.Emanuel told us that the co-ops launched before 2012.""Many of these co-ops were started in 2011 and were doing a lot of work to get ready,"" Emanuel told PunditFact. ""To apply for a loan, you had to do some serious analysis about the market and costs. You needed to have a business plan.""On the other hand, Emanuel said there isn’t any perfect comparison data to work with. His real point he said was ""to give some context for the closures,"" and ""to focus on when they began is to miss the forest for the trees.""""Their age? They were somewhere north of three years old,"" he told us.Scott Harrington is a business professor who focuses on health care finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  ""Some of the co-ops didn’t even last two years,"" Harrington said.We looked at the data to help resolve this.Failures accumulateFor several decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has tracked the births and deaths of firms in the Business Dynamics Statistics database. We crunched the numbers in two ways -- for all firms and for firms in the finance, insurance and real estate business. That industry group -- known by the acronym FIRE -- is broader than you would want but it’s the closest match to see how the insurance co-ops stack up against approximately similar kinds of firms.The bottom line is that after five years, about 44 percent of all businesses have disappeared. So Emanuel was pretty close when he said about half have closed.But as you might expect, the younger the companies, the lower the failure rate. Here are the average rates from 2000 to 2007, based on Census business data. (We didn’t include 2008 or 2009 because closings spiked during the Great Recession.)Average firm failure rate 2000-2007 After 1 yearAfter 2 yearsAfter 3 yearsAfter 4 yearsAfter 5 yearsFeatured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021All firms17%27%34%40%44%FIRE industry16%26%34%40%45% So Emanuel’s comparison ultimately boils down to how old the co-ops were.There is no perfect answer. Emanuel said they existed when they began doing the research to apply for a federal loan. You could say they were born on the day Washington approved their loans. We used the Census Bureau definition.The Census Bureau said it treats the first year a company shows employment in its payroll tax records as the year it was born.We looked at CoOportunity Health in Iowa. It was in the first wave of loan recipients on Feb. 17, 2012. The company’s former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ringless told us the loan award took the co-op to the next step of securing a state insurance license. When that came through, it hired a few consultants.""When the company was able to develop a payroll system in early June 2012, those consultants became full-time employees,"" Ringless said.Almost exactly two-and-half years later, on Jan. 29, 2015, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to liquidate CoOportunity Health. The firm was about $50 million in the red.While some employees were retained as the firm was wound down, as a going concern, its days ended in early 2015.We did not dig into the details of all of the failed co-ops but the CoOportunity timeline seems more or less to apply to many of them.A June 2013 Inspector General’s Office report looked at the 18 co-ops funded in the first half of 2012. The federal auditors said that by the end of 2012, all of the firms were still ""hiring staff, obtaining licensure, and building necessary infrastructure.""By the third quarter of 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 12 co-ops would no longer be in business as of 2016.Given all this, it would be reasonable to say the co-ops were three years old when they failed. That would run from mid-way through 2012 -- approximately the time of funding -- until mid-way through 2015 -- approximately the time the closure process was underway.The failure rate was over 50 percent. The corresponding failure rate at the three-year mark for all American businesses and for the broader finance, insurance and real estate sector is 34 percent. The co-ops fared significantly worse than the U.S. average, failing at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than is typical.Harrington at the University of Pennsylvania noted one other significant difference between the co-ops and the typical American start-up.""How many firms launch with heavy subsidies from the government?"" he asked.Our rulingEmanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate that’s typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureau’s definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators’ actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op.About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We won’t know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the group’s failure rate will be close to the national average.Emanuel’s statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details.

Terry McAuliffe recently issued an executive order that banned firearms from most state buildings and offered his rationale for a gun control measure he plans to present to the General Assembly this winter.McAuliffe, a Democrat, is calling for a law that would require all prospective gun buyers in Virginia to undergo a background check to determine whether the purchaser has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. Although the governor long has supported this action, his intensity grew after the Aug. 26 fatal shootings of Roanoke television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward near Smith Mountain Lake.Virginia law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct computerized checks on buyers. But sales between individuals are exempt and that, McAuliffe says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. A federal law requiring background checks has the same exemption.""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows,"" McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order.  Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required.The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates - including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D- Va. - in calling for a federal law mandating universal background checks. But as we and other fact checkers have noted previously, the research is old and limited. Consider:•The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the federal Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about their gun acquisitions going back to 1991.•Only 251 gun owners answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns and answered ""probably"" or ""probably not"" to whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer.McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being ""sold,"" as the governor said.The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check.The 1994 data, we also should note, did not have a category for online sales, as McAuliffe’s statement suggests.Featured Fact-checkElaine Luriastated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.On accepting corporate PAC donationsBy Warren Fiske • February 5, 2021Earlier this year, we asked the other co-author of the report, Philip Cook of Duke University, what percentage of guns currently are sold without a background check. In response, he sent us an op-ed that he and Ludwig wrote in the National Review after the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. - a time when the 40 percent figure was circulating again.  ""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of the 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote. ""Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage - nor does anyone else.""The lack of current data is due largely because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2013 directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-examine gun violence.We also should note that Virginia doesn’t keep data about private guns, said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. As a result, we recently gave a False rating to a statement by state Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City, that only 2 percent of Virginia gun sales are exempt from background checks. The fact is, nobody knows.Our rulingMcAuliffe said, ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows.""His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks.The researchers say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published.McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely.

It typically peaks in Georgia by early January, with upticks after Thanksgiving and Christmas when germs are often passed like holiday feasts.Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common of the season. This year’s vaccines protect against three viruses.The CDC develops its ""flu view"" map based on weekly reports from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico of outpatient visits to doctors for treatment of flu-like symptoms.The information is voluntarily submitted by doctors’ offices to their state public health departments.States on the CDC map are assigned to one of four levels of influenza-like illness activity -- minimal, low, moderate, or high.Georgia was identified as having ""low"" flu activity in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the most recent period for which outpatient information was available on Thursday.But that was a notch above the rest of the nation, which this early in flu season fell in the minimal range.""The biggest takeaway is the flu is here,"" said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health, ""and if you don’t have a flu shot, you need to get one.""Georgia did not report any hospitalizations or deaths due to the flu in that week, Nydam said.South Carolina, meanwhile, had four flu deaths but showed up with less flu activity on the CDC map because the map -- again --  is based on how many people see a doctor, not how many die.""It’s really misleading,"" Nydam said. ""The numbers (of patients with flu-like symptoms) are so low.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Georgia reported 22,273 patients visiting doctor’ offices in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, with 379 of those patients or 1.7 percent exhibiting flu-like symptoms.Compare that to a report from a week in December 2014, when 20,835 people visited doctors, 1,643 or 7.89 percent with flu-like symptoms.Changes come quicklyIf Georgia was identified as the state with the highest flu activity on Thursday, it was a different story Friday.That’s because on Friday the Georgia Department of Public Health had later, data from the week starting Oct. 11.It showed Georgia’s flu activity down in the minimal range, where the rest of the country had been the week before. (Of 25,876 patients, 355 or 1.37 percent had flu-like symptoms.South Carolina and Alaska jumped ahead of Georgia in activity, but they were just higher in the minimal range, Nydam said.The CDC doesn’t look at the flu activity in isolation, said Lynnette Brammer, CDC epidemiologist.The map is just one of nine resources that the CDC uses to track increases in flu-like illnesses across the country, she said.""You take a look at all those pieces, including laboratory data, and you can get a pretty complete picture of flu that comes in contact with health care systems,"" Brammer said.""With flu, you should never look at just one piece.""Doctors report cases where patients complain of flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough or sore throat, she said.""That flu-like illness may have been flu or may not have been,"" Brammer said.Our rulingGeorgia had the highest flu activity in the country based on data provided by doctors offices across the country and mapped by the CDC for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10.That information factors into the CDC’s efforts to track what goes on through flu season.

In Baltimore, up 54 percent. In Denver, up 75 percent.""And, O’Reilly said, ""in Austin, Texas, the murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent.""""Those are facts,"" he added. ""But President Obama and the left have not acknowledged them.""Nevermind O'Reilly's dart at Obama. We at PolitiFact Texas were curious about his singling out the murder rate in our headquarters city. Has Austin’s murder rate surged 83 percent?Counting killingsAccording to an online count of Austin homicides compiled by the Austin American-Statesman, based on deaths classified as murders by the Austin Police Department, 23 people have been killed in the city since the start of 2015, compared with 37 people in all of 2014.We asked O’Reilly how he reached his Austin conclusion. Fox pointed us to a City of Austin website presenting monthly crime reports from Art Acevedo, Austin’s police chief.O’Reilly relied on Acevedo’s August 2015 report stating 22 individuals had been murdered locally from January through August 2015, compared with 12 in the comparable stretch of 2014. That’s an 83 percent increase.But we realized that calculating these year-to-year percentage changes based on monthly reports can be misleading, given the small sample size. The day after O’Reilly spoke, the Austin Police Department posted the chief’s September 2015 report tallying 23 murders through that month of the year, up from 16 in the same part of 2014, or a 44 percent increase — roughly half the percentage relayed by O’Reilly. Notably, too, if O’Reilly had spoken out about Austin’s murder rate shortly after May 2015, he could have drawn on the chief’s reports to say it had ballooned 129 percent from the year before.Cherry picking?From the chief’s reports, we tried to get a fuller sense of changes by comparing full years of data.  According to the chief’s December 2014 report, the 32 Austin murders that year exceeded the 25 murders in the city in 2013 by 28 percent. Annual APD crime reports by the department indicate there were 26 murders in the city in 2013; 33 in 2012; 27 in 2011; 38 in 2010; 22 in 2009; and 23 in 2008.We took a similar longer view of the latest count available to O’Reilly by comparing Austin murders reported by Austin’s chief for the 12 months from September 2014 through August 2015 (42) to murders reported by the chief for the previous comparable period (20), which indicated--gadzooks! -- a 100 percent-plus increase.A different longer view is possible via crime statistics collected and analyzed by the FBI, which also calculates murder rates. Austin’s estimated 2014 murder rate of 3.7 per 100,000 residents was up 22 percent from the 2013 rate of 3 murders per 100,000 residents, Austin police said in an April 2015 preliminary report based on how the FBI defines crimes.If Austin ends 2015 with 23 murders--the number reported by the chief through September 2015--the 2015 murder rate will be 2.5 murders per 100,000 residents, we estimate. Of course, that calculation unrealistically assumes Austin won’t have another murder before 2016. Still, Austin could end up with a lower murder rate in 2015 than 2014..Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Austin Police Department, are local murders on a fast rise?We found another flaw with O'Reilly's methodology. Austin police Lt. Justin Newsom said caveats should be attached to the murder counts in the chief’s August 2015 report because it will be revised later. The 2014 tally has already been whittled down to remove deaths no longer classified as murders, and the 2015 count is almost certainly due to shrink.Newsom said the report’s count of 12 murders from January through August 2014 represents ""real murders"" and does not include killings not found to be murders by a grand jury or the district attorney. Conversely, Newsom said, the report’s count of 22 murders for the first eight months of 2015 folds in killings likely to be reclassified as homicides of a different variety, including, he said, six officer-involved shootings that could be deemed matters of self-defense or at the least not murders once finally reviewed by a grand jury and the district attorney.From the Statesman’s list of killings, we confirmed the six described police-involved shooting deaths, none of which had led to criminal charges at the time O’Reilly spoke.Generally, Newsom said by email, Austin homicide detectives have worked to resolve 18 murders that occurred in 2015 with all but two investigations culminating in suspects being identified, he said. If indeed 18 murders occurred from January 2015 through August 2015, that total would have been 50 percent greater than the murders tallied for the comparable part of 2014.Newsom sent us a chart showing the department’s count of murders each year from 2011 into 2015. On the chart, it looks as if there had been more murders in 2015 than through September in either of the previous two years yet fewer murders than during the comparable parts of 2011 or 2012.       SOURCE: Austin Police Department, October 2015 (received by email from Lt. Justin Newsom, Homicide Division, APD, Oct. 9, 2015)Our rulingO’Reilly said that from 2014 to 2015, Austin’s ""murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent.""There’s an element of truth here; the Austin police chief’s August 2015 report had figures indicating an 83 percent uptick in murders through that month compared to the same chunk of 2014.But the year-to-year comparison places a raw count of violent deaths in 2015 against killings confirmed as murders for the same part of 2014--generating an incomplete incorrect percentage. In contrast, if O’Reilly had pulled back the camera, so to speak, he could have determined that Austin appears on pace to have a lower murder rate in 2015 than in 2014.We rate his claim Mostly False.MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","http://www.billoreilly.com/b/Violence-Growing-in-America/-321368858640864867.html,http://projects.statesman.com/homicides/,http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/Copy_of_APD_ChiefMonthlyReport_Aug15.xls,https://www.austintexas.gov/page/annual-crime-traffic-reports,https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/2014_crime_and_traffic_report_040215.pdf,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/",,"City Government,Criminal Justice,Crime,Texas,Bill O'Reilly",,,,,

""While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked.""We were curious about her claim that less than a percent of firearms dealers found to be noncompliant had their licenses revoked by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the agency tasked with overseeing gun sales.Clinton’s numbers are slightly off, but she’s right that it’s extremely rare for a noncompliant dealer to lose its license. Whether that means ""bad actors"" are getting away, however, remains up for debate.Not a straight shot to revocationClinton’s spokesperson Josh Schwerin told us the campaign got its figures from a 2013 Justice Department audit of the ATF following the Sandy Hook shooting.According to the audit, the ATF found 62 percent of more than 10,000 inspected gun dealers did not violate firearms law in 2011. Clinton’s campaign took this to mean that 38 percent of dealers were noncompliant.But the actual figure is closer to 31 percent, because about 6 percent of gun dealers were categorized as ""other"" and an additional percent opted to give up their license.Out of the noncompliant dealers, only 71 had their licenses revoked. That’s 0.05 percent of all dealers active that year (over 120,000), but 0.68 percent of inspected dealers. Clearly, both are small numbers.Why do so few noncompliant dealers get their licenses revoked?For starters, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 stipulates that the ATF can only take away licenses when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law. So rather than revoking licenses automatically, ATF gives dealers chances to redeem themselves.If the ATF finds that a dealer has been noncompliant, it first issues a report of violations. More significant violations — for example, not properly logging gun acquisitions and gun sales — or repeated paperwork errors prompt a warning letter or a warning conference. In 2011, as with most years, 97 percent of noncompliant dealers agreed to make changes to become compliant.""There’s a difference between people having a hard time trying to do the right thing versus people who don’t have any interest in doing the right thing at all,"" said Suzanne Dabkowski, a public information officer and industry operations investigator at ATF’s field division in Columbus, Ohio. ""Most people do seem to want to do it correctly.""According to the ATF, it’s rare for a dealer to demonstrate a blatant disregard for the law — ""willful"" noncompliance. This can include serious violations like knowingly selling to straw buyers (someone buying a gun for someone else who wouldn’t be able to pass the background check) or minors or consistently ignoring ATF warnings, said Mike Bouchard, a former ATF assistant director for field operations.Only in those cases does the ATF recommend revocation, and a separate process kicks in. The recommendation first goes through ATF internal review, including legal consultation. If the recommendation is approved, the dealer can request a hearing and make the case that its violations were not willful. Should the ATF decide to press on, the dealer can take the case to the U.S District Court.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021With all this back and forth, revoking a license can take over two years, according to the Dept. of Justice audit. Meanwhile, dealers facing pending license loss can and do still sell firearms.Procedural pains or procedural justiceIn her gun plan, Clinton promised to increase ATF funding and ""aggressively enforce current law"" to weed out rogue dealers.It’s important to note license revocation requires an extremely high burden of proof, thanks to the ""willful"" violation requirement, according to Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.For example, she said, if a dealer is selling guns without background checks, it could falsely claim that it just forgot to create the required record. Similarly, it would be very difficult for the ATF to prove that a dealer is abetting a straw purchase ""unless there is video or audio footage,"" Nichols said.Gun dealers, however, contend that the inspections regime ensures due process. Many violations reported by the ATF are paperwork mistakes that don’t endanger the public (i.e. writing ""Y"" instead of ""Yes""), said Larry Keane, the senior vice president of the firearms industry’s trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation.""The dealers have certain rights, and ATF has certain rights to shut them down if they’re bad apples,"" he said. ""No one minimizes the paperwork violations. That still results in warning letters or more. ...The idea that dealers are selling guns to criminals willy nilly is just false.""Many of the most common violations are indeed paperwork errors, but the list also includes not obtaining identification, not reporting multiple handgun sales, and selling guns to someone likely to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Here’s a snapshot:If bad dealers are getting away, said Bouchard, ""it’s a resource issue.""ATF’s staff size, 2,500 agents, hasn’t increased in four decades unlike other law enforcement agencies. To conduct all the inspections due in a year, the agency would need to increase its manpower by 45 percent, according to the Dept. of Justice.On top of that, by law, the ATF is not allowed to keep a centralized electronic database, and it must prioritize other duties (i.e. explosives inspections) over cyclical inspections of firearms dealers.As a result, 58 percent of dealers haven’t been inspected within five years, the legal requirement. In practice, visits actually come only once a decade, reports the Washington Post.""There are so few agents and inspectors to do all the work,"" said Bouchard.Our rulingClinton said, ""While 38 percent of dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked.""The numbers are slightly off. About 30 percent of inspected dealers had violated firearms regulations in 2011, and about 0.7 percent of them had their licenses revoked.That’s because revocations are only allowed when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law, which some say is a huge legal obstacle. The inspections and revocations process gives noncompliant dealers the chance to demonstrate willingness to comply, and the vast majority say that they will.We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.","https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/10/04/clinton-believes-its-time-to-tackle-gun-violence/,https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2013/e1305.pdf,https://data.atf.gov/Licensees/Firearms-Licensees-Compliance-Inspections-1969-to-/2423-3t7p,https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/49,https://www.atf.gov/file/61696/download,https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/pr/federal-firearms-compliance-inspections,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.atf.gov/file/61696/download,https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/pr/staffing-and-budget,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2010/10/25/GR2010102506193.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/us/legislative-handcuffs-limit-atfs-ability-to-fight-gun-crime.html?pagewanted=all,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap44.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/25/AR2010102505823.html",,"National,Regulation,Guns,Hillary Clinton",,,,,

The Republican state comptroller has launched a 27-city ""Good for Texas"" tour of the state that got our attention after he told Georgetown residents Texas remains a magnet for people otherwise stuck elsewhere.""We have 650 people who move to Texas every day who want to come here for that economic opportunity,"" Hegar said Sept. 10, 2015, according to Community Impact News. ""That’s about half a million people who are moving to Texas every single year, and there is no better place to see that than in Central Texas and this region. The population increase has been phenomenal.""We suspect Hegar's ""about half a million"" referred to the state's total annual population growth. But was he right about 650 people a day moving to the state?We’ve spotted flaws in Gone-To-Texas claims before. In June 2014, for instance, we pointed out that while 1,000 people a day may have moved to the state from July 2012 through June 2013, net migration — taking into account people who (unfathomably) left Texas — broke out to about 487 people a day, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.To our inquiry about Hegar’s figure, Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, told us by email that he relied on figures provided by IHS Inc., a Colorado-based consulting and information-services company. She also sent along a chart stating that according to IHS and the Census Bureau, Texas grew by 1,230 residents a day in 2014 with net migration, from other states and abroad, accounting for 666 of that average daily increase; Texas births outpacing deaths explained the rest of the growth.We sought elaboration from an IHS economist, Karl Kuykendall, who said the company reached its net migration figures for 2014 by starting from the bureau’s Current Population Survey estimates for net migration into Texas from July 2013 through June 2014, drawing on state population estimates released in December 2014, then reaching a calendar-year 2014 estimation of migration by assuming the state would grow at the same pace through December 2014.Kuykendall also guided us to the bureau’s population estimates of annual net migration to Texas, domestic and international, covering July-through-June periods from 2010-11 through 2013-14.From that, we confirmed the bureau’s latest estimates indicated Texas enjoyed a July 2013-July 2014 net gain of 84,637 residents through international migration and a net gain of 154,467 residents thanks to domestic migration. All told, that breaks out to total net migration to Texas of 655 people a day, very close to the 666 net migration estimated by IHS for all of 2014.Separately, an expert with the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center, directed by Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, told us it previously calculated the same net migration of 655 people a day. By email, Rafael Emmanuel González said the center reached the figure by pairing data from the bureau’s 2014 Population Estimates of the Components of Population Change and information from the bureau’s 2013 State-to-State Migration Flows.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post“Trump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 4, 2021So the best available numbers at the time Hegar spoke support what he said.González noted, though, that the bureau subsequently posted fresh figures based on its one-year American Community Survey perhaps indicating even greater net migration to Texas. The  information wouldn’t have been available to Hegar when he spoke. Still, it’s worth mentioning that according to these ACS results, an estimated 538,572 Texas residents reported living in another state the year before and 217,392 had been living abroad. Subtract the 435,107 people estimated to have left Texas for another state in the meantime, and net migration to Texas amounts to 320,857 people--or 879 net new residents a day. That’s probably an overstatement to a degree; the bureau does not try to estimate the number of people who have left any state for another country, Bernstein said.We asked Potter about why migration estimates bounce around. He emailed: ""From year to year, migration numbers do fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. Our economy was doing very well in 2013-14, bolstered by oil extraction, but was doing well even without. Next year, I’m anticipating migration will still be high, but we may see some muffling starting to show up with the reductions in extraction. Migration is usually and mostly driven by economic opportunity, thus, as our economy goes, we can expect migration to go.""Our rulingHegar said: ""We have 650 people who move to Texas every day.""Different government estimates suggest the state has lately been netting 655 or even around 880 new residents a day, depending on the estimate. It’s also worth noting Hegar could float a much bigger number by tallying solely people GTT, but that number would fail to account for people leaving the state.We rate this claim True.TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.CLARIFICATION, 4:40 p.m., Oct. 2, 2015: We added a clarifying sentence to this story after we recognized, post-publication, that Hegar's figure for people who move to Texas every day did not add up to about half a million new residents a year; we suspect he was referring in his speech to total annual population growth, taking into account Texas births outpacing deaths.

Tammy Baldwin was interviewed on ""The Devil's Advocates"" radio program on Sept. 23, 2015, the day before Pope Francis made his historic appearance before a joint session of Congress.The hosts of the Madison-based talk show asked Baldwin, a Democrat, about her expectations for the address. Then they shifted to a bill introduced by Baldwin to get rid of ""carried interest,"" which she describes as a tax loophole that unfairly benefits Wall Street investment managers.Host Mike Crute said: ""Tammy, I never thought I would find the day where Donald Trump, the pope and you all agree that the carried interest loophole should be closed. This is contributing to the income inequality we have here in our nation.""Baldwin replied by asking, with a chuckle: ""So which of those three people surprise you the most, in terms of supporting that?"" Crute said: ""I would say Donald Trump, quite frankly. I think he sort of let out the secret."" Then Baldwin said: ""I’m teasing you, I’m teasing you,"" and Crute continued with serious questions about her proposal.A few minutes later, after Baldwin discussed carried interest in detail, host Dominic Salvia asked Baldwin if anyone opposes her proposal.Baldwin said: ""Yes, there are people who oppose this change, otherwise it would have probably been law by now. But I do have to just say that I agree with you that when the pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree on an important tax change, maybe it should be getting swifter consideration than it has gotten to date.""As one wag put it on Twitter: ""That’s one heck of a hot tub.""A spokesman in Baldwin’s office told us the senator was not saying that the pope has endorsed the legislation, and that the conversation was about closing the carried interest loophole and the larger issue of income inequality.But she did state that both Trump and the pope agree with her proposal.Do they?""Carried interest""""Carried interest,"" as described by The Wall Street Journal, is a ""much-criticized"" tax break that allows investment managers to treat much of their income as capital gains. That means the money typically is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary wage income. The current capital gains rate for high earners is 23.8 percent, while the top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6 percent.Some praise the tax break as a contributor to the growth of the investment management, private equity, real estate and energy industries, and as having had a positive effect on the overall economy and increasing tax revenues.Bills to end, or limit, carried interest have passed the House of Representatives four times, most recently in 2010, but died in the Senate, according to the publication Pensions & Investments.In June 2015, Baldwin and another Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, introduced a bill to end carried interest, with Levin saying it was unfair that such higher-income earners paid lower income tax rates than other Americans. The measure would increase tax collections by $15.6 billion over 10 years, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post""Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.""By Bill McCarthy • February 8, 2021The effort for repeal got a boost in September 2015, when Obama called for ending carried interest. But a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- where the bill has been referred -- has said the issue should be considered only in the context of comprehensive tax reform.So, Baldwin is among a number of Democrats seeking to repeal carried interest. But what about Trump – and the pope?The Donald and the pontiffIt turns out that Trump -- as well as another leading GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – have called for ending carried interest. Indeed, Democrats have celebrated their remarks.In one interview, Trump said: ""I would take carried interest out, and I would let people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they’re paying very little tax, and I think it’s outrageous.""OK. But has Pope Francis stated a position on a tax loophole that most Americans have never heard of? Indeed, it would be rare for the pope to comment on any piece of legislation, much less one dealing with an arcane tax provision.Perhaps Baldwin was assuming his support, based on statements that Francis -- who promotes a Catholic church that ""is poor and for the poor"" -- has made about economic inequality.For example, in 2013, in the first major work he authored as pope, Francis said:""We can no longer trust in the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market. Growth in justice requires more than economic growth, while presupposing such growth: it requires decisions, programs, mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality.""But we could not find any instances of the pope speaking about carried interest, let alone Baldwin’s specific proposal. Moreover, his practice is to make broad statements, aimed at global audience, not to comment on one bill in one country. Simply put, there is no way to know based on his general statements whether the pontiff would support any particular legislation.Our ratingBaldwin said: ""The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree"" on eliminating the ""carried-interest"" tax break.Trump has called for ending the tax break for investment managers that Baldwin is seeking to repeal with a bill she introduced.But while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that has spoken out on this particular tax break. And his practice is to make broad policy statements, not to comment on an individual piece of legislation.If it turns out the pope has spoken about carried interest, we will review this item, but for now we rate Baldwin's statement Half True.Related itemsMatthew Dowd: Pope Francis ""took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims"" (Mostly True)Hillary Clinton: Hedge fund managers ""pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers"" (False)","http://darnwi.com/,http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/national/pope-francis-urges-congress-to-embrace-migrants-329150081.html,https://twitter.com/Schneider_CM?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-senators-urge-treasury-to-limit-carried-interest-tax-break-1442928663,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/09/22/whats-so-awful-about-the-carried-interest-tax-law/,http://www.pionline.com/article/20150625/ONLINE/150629913/lawmakers-propose-bill-to-end-carried-interest,http://www.pionline.com/article/20150625/ONLINE/150629913/lawmakers-propose-bill-to-end-carried-interest,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2889,http://www.pionline.com/article/20150917/ONLINE/150919897/joint-committee-on-taxation-ending-carried-interest-will-raise-156-billion,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/08/facebook-posts/did-weeknd-flash-word-satan-during-his-super-bowl-/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-senators-urge-treasury-to-limit-carried-interest-tax-break-1442928663,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2889/committees,https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-senators-urge-treasury-to-limit-carried-interest-tax-break-1442928663,https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeb-bush-proposes-tax-cuts-for-investment-income-limits-on-deductions-1441819958,http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/senate-democrats-cheer-donald-trump-for-bashing-tax-loopholes/?dcz=,http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/26/trump-tax-carried-interest-at-same-rate-as-income-hedge-fund-limited-real-estate-people-should-pay-more/,http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html,https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/22/matthew-dowd/did-popes-namesake-st-francis-reach-out-muslims/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hedge-fund-managers-pay-less-/",,"Financial Regulation,Income,Religion,Taxes,Wisconsin,Tammy Baldwin",,,,,

This is something we’ve looked at before.The main psychoactive agent in marijuana is THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.THC levels differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years.But what about marijuana itself?

The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period.Back in the late 1970s , the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research with the monitoring project, told us in an interview for a prior fact-check.Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007.But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said.For the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s uncertainty about what rising THC levels mean.Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level.In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs.Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact.Our rulingFiorina said the marijuana kids smoke today is not what it was 40 years ago. Studies back that up. THC potency is up, with a growing fraction of seized marijuana having a concentration of 9 percent or more. There is some evidence that users smoke less when the pot is more potent, but that doesn’t detract from Fiorina’s main point.We rate this claim True.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/24/patrick-kennedy/has-potency-pot-changed-president-obama-was-high-s/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"National,Drugs,Carly Fiorina",,,,,

Jorge Ramos, a news anchor on Univision and Fusion, makes no secret of his disdain for the idea.A few days after attracting widespread notice after being thrown out of a Donald Trump press conference while asking a question on immigration policy (he was later allowed back in), Ramos accepted an invitation to appear on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor on Sept. 2, 2015. Host Bill O’Reilly’s first question pressed him on the issue of a border wall.O’Reilly: ""You don’t want a border wall. You don’t want that. Why not?""Ramos: ""It’s a completely absurd idea. Why would you want to build a 1,900-mile wall between Mexico and the United States if almost 40 percent of all immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas?""Ramos is far from the first person to deploy the statistic that 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants come into the country under a legal visa and then stay beyond its expiration date. Two Republican presidential candidates, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have said the same thing. When we checked Rubio’s claim, we rated it Mostly True.However, Ramos’ statement adds the wrinkle that these people typically arrive by plane to rebut the notion that a wall would stop unauthorized immigration. As it turns out, it's hard to prove how they travel.Actually, 40 percent might be too lowThe key research on ""overstays"" -- the working term for this group of unauthorized immigrants Ramos had in mind -- was undertaken in 1997 by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS estimated that overstays accounted for 41 percent of the undocumented.Here we’ll add a bit of complexity. Immigration researchers divide the undocumented into two groups -- overstays and ""entries without inspection."" The first group might have a student, temporary work or tourist visa. The second group never went through any review. Robert Warren -- who helped with that work at the INS and now is a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, a research group founded by Catholic missionaries -- told PunditFact that not only does the balance between the two still hold, it has likely tilted toward the overstays.""Since 2000, arrivals from Mexico, who are about 85-90 percent 'entries without inspection,' have plummeted, while overstays have increased, or stayed at about their historical levels,"" Warren said.Warren said the shift likely stems from U.S. efforts that have made it harder to enter by land.He sent us this graph from his latest research at the center.Source: Center for Migration StudiesAnalysts with two other organizations, the Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute, largely back Warren’s overall estimates.""It is likely that the 40 percent figure is still valid and, if anything, the share of unauthorized immigrants who are visa overstayers is probably higher than 40 percent,"" said Jeffrey Passel at Pew.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said his group uses a wider range for overstays of one-third to one-half. While he’s comfortable with that, he noted it ultimately goes back to data collected by Pew in 2006.""It’s widely cited and generally accepted as accurate, but it should be taken with a grain of salt because the estimate is old and characterized by some uncertainty,"" he said.Rosenblum said the Department of Homeland Security has developed a way to count overstays who arrive by air or sea, but so far, the department doesn’t seem to have settled on an approach for people who enter at a land port of entry, such as the southern border. We reached out to a couple of agencies within the department, but did not get any information.Guesstimating the fliersIf the 40 percent stat is defensible, the point that all those people arrive by air is much less so. In fact, the limited data we have suggests that whatever fraction flies into the country, it is less than 40 percent.When we asked Ramos for his source, he pointed us to a 2006 report by Pew. However, while that assessment provides the 40 percent figure, it gives no details on the fraction that arrived in an airplane.All of the experts we asked said they could only provide a gut assessment on this question.""I have no information"" on the form of transportation used by overstayers at the time of their entry, Pew’s Passel said, ""but I suspect that most of them do arrive by plane.""But Rosenblum noted that overstays represent about 16 percent of unauthorized Mexican immigrants, about 27 percent of unauthorized Central Americans, and about 91 percent of all other unauthorized immigrants. Using his group’s estimates of the unauthorized population, that translates into about a third of all overstays coming from Mexico and Central America, and about two-thirds coming from the rest of the world.""Many, but not all, of the Mexican and Central American overstayers likely arrived legally by land,"" Rosenblum said. ""Almost all of the other overstayers likely arrived by air.""So let’s assume that none of the Mexican and Central American arrivals came by air, but all of the other arrivals did fly in. Since two-thirds of the overstays come from places other than Mexico and Central America, that would mean that two-thirds of the overstay population (the 40 percent figure) came by air, or about 27 percent.That’s not far from the result Warren got using a slightly different approach. He estimated that at least one-third of the undocumented population arrives by air.Ramos acknowledged the lack of hard data behind his statement.""The important fact is that around 40 percent came legally and then overstayed their visas,"" he said. ""How they got here is another matter."" A final note: The rationale for building a wall between the United States and Mexico is strongly linked to the idea that illegal immigration is fundamentally a problem of a porous southern border. Ramos, Rubio and Bush use the 40 percent figure to highlight that a large portion of the problem lies elsewhere. However, Rosenblum noted that does not make the two groups equivalent.""One difference between overstayers and those who enter unlawfully is that overstayers have been screened and found admissible at least once, while those who enter another way  -- mostly by crossing the border, or passing illegally through a port of entry -- could include people who would be inadmissible, because they have committed serious crimes or are on a security watchlist,"" Rosenblum said. ""This is a legitimate reason to be more focused on illegal entries than overstayers.""Our rulingRamos said that about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants fly into the country and overstay their visas. While there is some evidence that overstays represent about 40 percent of the unauthorized population, and perhaps more, the best estimates of those flying in -- which are admittedly a bit shaky -- could be as low as one-quarter or somewhat more than one-third. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.Editor's note: Shortly after we published this fact-check, we added the word ""undocumented"" in parenthesis to our ruling statement to clarify the context of Ramos' remarks, specifically that he was speaking of undocumented immigrants, not all immigrants. The rating remains the same.  Share the Facts   Politifact    3 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  ""Almost 40 percent of all (undocumented) immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas.""

But on Aug. 25, he lobbed a different message into the twittersphere. Schilling passed along a graphic to his 133,000 followers that had a photo of Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute. The image had two lines.""It’s said that only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists.""In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. How’d that go?""Schilling quickly found himself suspended from commentary duties by ESPN.  He retracted the tweet and wrote, ""I understand and accept my suspension. 100% my fault. Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part."" Still, many readers asked us to assess his claim.The point of the graphic is opaque, and its logic faces some logical stumbling blocks. Muslim extremists are non-state actors, while German Nazis were fighting for the German nation. And as Vox pointed out, Muslim extremists primarily kill other Muslims, while Germans signed on to subjugate or kill non-Germans, Jews, gays, and political opponents of any stripe. These are not insignificant differences.Regarding extremist Muslims, we’ve examined before the challenge of identifying, much less counting them. If counting armed jihadists is your standard, then a 2014 estimate done for the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, the follow-on group to the 9-11 Commission, suggests there are about 100,000. Out of a worldwide Muslim population of about 945 million, that’s about a hundredth of a percent.But beyond actual fighters, the definition can rest in the eye of the beholder. The kind of numbers thrown around in the tweet would include Muslims who might endorse some fundamentalist principles but not all. You won’t find reliable numbers because the definition is vague and the data are too limited.That loose standard for Muslim extremists stands in sharp contrast to the numbers behind the claim about Germans, our focus in this fact-check.The statistic that in 1940, only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis seems to rely on a very narrow definition of who was a Nazi. If it has any accuracy, it counts only Germans who formally joined the party, which excludes a much larger number who were supporters.In his book The Nazi Party 1919-1945: A complete history, Dietrich Orlow wrote that early in the war, membership in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (the full name of the Nazi party) surged to about 6.5 million.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021Georg Fertig is a professor of economic history and specialist in historical demography at Halle University in Germany. Fertig told us the 6.5 million figure is based on sound sources. Fertig and a large team of economic and social historians recently collected historical data on Germany going back to 1834. It shows that in 1940, there were about 69.8 million Germans.That would mean party members represented about 9 percent of the total. That’s not too much different from Schilling’s figure.But party membership was for adults, not children. In 1939, Germany had about 52 million people over 15. In that light, formal Nazi party members represented about 12 percent of the relevant population. However, the wrinkles don’t stop there. By 1940, Germany had annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, so defining the German population base gets dicey.If party membership was the be-all and end-all of defining Nazi supporters, the claim would be in fine shape. But the reality is far from that simple.For starters, in the last totally free elections in Germany in 1932, the Nazi party beat out every other party, winning about 33 percent of the vote and taking control of the parliament, or Reichstag. That election put Hitler on his path to running the country. (In presidential elections earlier in the year, Hitler did not do as well.) Fertig said the Reichstag vote is an inexact yardstick for German support, although it captures some level of popular sympathy for the Nazi agenda. After 1933, Germany was a totalitarian state, and voting was either coerced or nonexistent.Thomas Kuehne is a professor of history and director of Holocaust and genocide graduate studies at Clark University. Kuehne told PunditFact that it is difficult to define with certainty who was a Nazi. Formal membership in the party was just one measure.Kuehne said the general consensus among historians is that the regime’s popularity peaked around 1940 thanks to the rapid German victories known as Blitzkrieg. He sees the winning percentage of 33 percent in 1932 as a useful benchmark.""There is no reason to assume that this share decreased before, say, late 1944,"" Kuehne said. ""The 7 percent figure is totally misleading.""But even with that, both experts cautioned that it is notoriously difficult to put hard numbers to the question of which Germans would call themselves a Nazi.Our rulingSchilling tweeted that in 1940 only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis. That figure is too low. It might be close for the more limited fraction of Nazi supporters who formally joined the party, but it ignores the Nazis’ electoral domination in 1932 and the popularity that came after the first military victories in 1939. The vote results and the assessment of the experts we reached point to a much larger figure in the range of 35 percent. That’s five times larger than the figure in the tweet.We rate this claim Mostly False.","https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/636262473826463744,https://www.vox.com/2015/8/25/9206753/curt-schilling-muslims-nazis,https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/,https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/26/opinion/bergen-schneider-how-many-jihadists/,http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf,https://books.google.com/books?id=9a9MRnxtdJgC&pg=PT427&dq=percent+Germans+members+Nazi+Party+1940&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBmoVChMItKftj_XExwIVDSmICh1EVgc4#v=onepage&q=percent%20Germans%20members%20Nazi%20Party%201940&f=false,/personalities/greg-kelly/,/factchecks/2021/feb/09/greg-kelly/newsmax-host-falsely-claims-only-one-person-died-c/,https://figshare.com/articles/German_Time_Series_Dataset_1834_2012/1450809,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1947146?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents",,"Terrorism,PunditFact,Curt Schilling",,,,,

""And it’s not doing that now, because we are eviscerating our defense spending.""One example he cited: ""We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots.""We were curious if that number was correct, so we decided to check it out.Army announcementArmy officials had been talking about reducing the size of their force for several months when they announced specific plans in July 2015. The Army said it will cut the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018 -- that’s 40,000 -- with some of the largest cuts at sites in Georgia and Texas. Those cuts will start in October 2015 and end by October 2018. That means the cuts to the Army haven’t happened yet and will be finished under the next president.The cuts are expected to come through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. That’s in addition to plans to cut 17,000 civilians.The Army has been substantially scaling back its force the past few years. In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. In 2013, the Army announced a drawdown of 80,000 to bring the size to the current 490,000. The new cuts will save about $7 billion.Army officials said the cuts are a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the budget sequestration that followed. If sequestration continues, the Army expects to shrink to about 420,000 soldiers sometime in 2019.""We think 450,000 is the minimum force to meet our obligations across the globe,"" Army spokesman Lt. Cmd. Joe Buccino told PolitiFact.Some lawmakers have questioned the cuts in light of the current situation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other crises. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in May, Rubio was critical of Obama’s actions in Iraq and Syria. He called for the president to ""increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq.""Rubio correctly cited the number that the Army plans to cut, but he omitted some caveats, including that the cuts haven’t taken place yet.

Far from it.""The history of school prayer and Bible reading before the 1960s is complicated, but it is certainly not the case that there was a universal practice on school prayer that applied to all students,"" said Richard Layton, co-author of the 2014 book For the Civic Good: The Liberal Case for Teaching Religion in the Public Schools and an associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Layton pointed us to a 1961 article from the Religious Education journal, which contained a survey from around 1960 that dealt with school prayer and Bible reading. The survey was mailed to 4,000 school district superintendents around the nation. About 55 percent responded.The survey includes many categories, but there was one clear takeaway: The country was divided on religious education, Bible reading and prayer in schools.Almost half of respondents said ""homeroom devotional services"" were not held in the school district. Of the superintendents who said their districts oversaw homeroom devotionals, only one-third said that all district schools had them, while 17 percent said that only some schools did.They were similarly divided on Bible readings. About 42 percent of superintendents said that schools in their system had them. The remaining 58 percent said readings did not happen in their district.Different schools incorporated religion and Bible discussion in different ways, but the Bible was not the ""principal textbook,"" experts told us. While Bibles may have been passed out in certain schools with other textbooks, this was not always the case. Some schools read passages from the Bible over the speaker, and in others teachers read scripture in front of the class.Whatever their district’s practice, the majority of superintendents felt that their school district was dealing with religion in an ""adequate way.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post""Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.""By Bill McCarthy • February 8, 2021What state laws saidState laws from the early 20th century also show a divide on religion in schools.A 1926 report indicated that only seven states (in addition to the District of Columbia) required Bible reading in all public schools. Another seven states allowed the Bible to be read in public schools but did not require it. Numerous other states were silent on the issue.By 1946, a survey showed that the number of states permitting or requiring Bible reading had increased, according to the 1950 book Church and State in the United States. Thirteen states (and Washington, D.C.) required Bible reading, and 25 more allowed Bible reading.Generally, Bible reading and ""homeroom devotional services"" in public schools were far more prevalent in the southern and northeastern states than elsewhere in the country.Supreme Court’s sweeping change The Supreme Court decisions that Cruz mentioned had the biggest impact on schools that sponsored Bible readings or prayers.In the 1962 case Engel vs. Vitale, the court overturned a New York law requiring a nondenominational prayer at the beginning of the school day. Although students could opt not to participate, the court reasoned that the law violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which was aimed at preventing government interference with religion.A year later, the court ruled in Abington School District vs. Schempp that school-sponsored Bible readings were also unconstitutional, using similar reasoning as in Engel vs. Vitale.The Supreme Court decisions resulted in bans on government- and school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings in public schools. Private prayers and personal Bible reading were still allowed at school, so they were not entirely ""banned.""Subsequent cases in 1990 and 2000 have dealt with student religious groups meeting on school grounds after hours and student-led prayer before games. (The latter was ruled unconstitutional.)Our rulingCruz said, ""Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started,"" and ""the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools.""Surveys and state laws from the era show school prayer and Bible reading were not as universal as Cruz said. Survey results of superintendents from the time show the nation’s schools were split roughly down the middle when it came to either religious activity.

Five of them were in Georgia, 19 were in Alabama, 5 were in North Carolina, 11 were in South Carolina and 6 were in Tennessee.Fifty of the 218 people have required hospitalization for Salmonella, the major symptoms of which are usually diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. No deaths have been reported, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said.So how exactly do CDC officials know that some of these cases are due to backyard breeders kissing and cuddling live poultry?Dr. Megin Nichols, a veterinarian with the CDC, told PolitiFact the agency has been tracking upward trends in both the number of outbreaks and people infected in the past five years and has been working to trace their causes.""We’ve been trying to interview these people to find out how they are getting sick,"" Nichols said. ""We are finding a certain proportion that are due to very close contact -- something that surprised us here at the CDC.""Salmonella is a germ that lives naturally in the intestine of chickens, ducks and many other animals. It doesn’t typically make the birds sick, but they can transmit the germs in their droppings and on their feet, feathers and beaks, even when they look clean and healthy, the CDC says.The germs also can get on their cages, coops, feed, water dishes, hay, plants and the area where they live and roam. In addition, the bacteria can rest on the hands, shoes and clothes of those who work around the birds or play with them.And Nichols told us that among the people who became ill between 2008 and 2014 due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400, reported snuggling and holding baby birds.Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds, she said.Those people, many of whom were young children, became sick through fecal oral contact, Nichols said. Those same interviews also showed that about 46 percent of backyard breeders are keeping live poultry in their homes, she said.Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked the most recent four outbreaks of human Salmonella infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry from multiple hatcheries.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Interviews have been conducted with 140 of those who were recently ill and, 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. Additional interviews to determine whether that contact included snuggling and kissing have yet to be conducted, Nichols said.An increasing number of people around the country are choosing to keep live poultry - mostly chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese as part of a greener, healthier lifestyle.Local governments, including several in metro Atlanta, have changed their zoning ordinances in recent years to accommodate the trend, and groups of backyard poultry buffs meet regularly in the region to talk chicken.Backyard owners have told reporters at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the benefits include fresh eggs and meat, a built-in source of fertilizer for their gardens and ready-made bug-killers. Some say they give their chickens names, the freedom to roam the house and yard and cuddle and coddle them like family pets.The larger problemAccording to the CDC, salmonella, named for an American scientist who discovered the bacteria, is estimated to cause a million illnesses in the United States a year, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths. Most people develop diarrhea and the other conditions within 12 to 72 hour after infection and recover without treatment in four to seven days.It has the potential to turn deadly if it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream, and then to other body sites. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is critical, and the elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness.In the largest recent outbreak, which occurred between March 2013 and July 2014, more than 600 people in 29 states and Puerto Rico were infected with seven outbreak strains. The outbreak was associated with one brand of chicken, which led to a company recall of more than 40,000 pounds of chicken products, according to the CDC.To prevent salmonella infections related to backyard farming, the CDC’s Nichols encourages several common-sense rules. These include thorough handwashing after contact with the chicken, keeping live poultry out of the home, and avoiding snuggling, close contact with the birds’ beaks or other close exposure that would allow ingestion of bacteria.She will be one of the experts featured in a webinar on the topic of practicing backyard bird biosecurity at 7p.m. Thursday.Our conclusionThe CDC has issued a warning against kissing or snuggling backyard chickens. It follows four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia.Interviews have been conducted with 140 of the ill and 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website.The CDC also has evidence from outbreaks between 2008 to 2014. In that period, they found that of the people who became infected with salmonella due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400 people, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds..That’s cause to sound the alarm.We rate the CDC warning True.","/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/birdbiosecurity/downloads/august_webinar_2015.pdf.",,"Georgia,Agriculture,Animals,Food Safety,Public Health,Urban,Centers for Disease Control",,,,,

But its own website encourages users to check with other government agencies and conduct an Internet search before requesting documents.Why? The answer is in the numbers. By comparison, the first Google index of the Internet in 1998 had 26 million pages. By 2000, there were 1 billion pages.And Google isn’t charging money for many of the same documents that the NTIS is charging taxpayers to catalog and print.""Georgians are frustrated by the federal government because it is plagued by wasteful spending and redundancy, and the National Technical Information Service is a perfect example of both,"" U.S. Sen. David Perdue, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a press release.So, is the government spending an estimated $170 million a year of taxpayer money to make documents publicly available when a search engine does it for free? We decided to check.GOVERNMENT 101Take an introductory political science course (and hopefully a high school civics class) and you learn government’s role in providing services.Part of the theory around all that is government’s role in providing what may have social value but not necessarily earn a profit. Spreading the costs among all citizens in the form of taxes is how government provides things such as a military on the national level and schools on the local level.Government watchdogs, though, have for years questioned spending on services where private-sector competition could lower taxes on everyone. Toll roads, anyone?But not everything that seems wasteful turns out to have no value. Consider the National Helium Reserve.The federal government set it up in 1925 to act as a strategic supply for dirigibles back when the U.S. worried about German airships in battle.It served as a punch line through the decades, including during a 2013 congressional vote to extend the program.But the jokes belied why it still exists. Helium became an important coolant during the Space Race and, later, a key way to keep computers and other technology contaminant-free, all during a time when the private sector was unable to meet demand.So, could the National Technical Information Service be a similar program that sounds ridiculous but actually is not?THE NTISThe Government Accountability Office looked at that very question in 2012. After examining the agency’s organization, function, staffing levels, demand for reports and work, the GAO found that 74 percent of the NTIS reports between 1990 and 2011 were ""readily available"" elsewhere, usually from the originating agency’s website.And 95 percent of that 74 percent of reports were free, the GAO estimated, while the NTIS lost an average of $1 million a year for the past decade.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021""In looking across the years, at one point they were self-sustaining as a repository,"" said Valerie C. Melvin, director of the GAO’s Information Management and Technology Resources Issues Office.""But we found it was not able to sustain itself with the demand and sale of reports in recent years and suggested Congress look at the viability of its statutory function,"" she said.Melvin testified to those findings about a dated business model before the U.S, Senate in 2014.NTIS Director Bruce Borzino countered in his own testimony that his office is the one posting many of those reports to the Web. And many other federal departments do not have the technical expertise to maintain the permanent access of their information.A spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the office also ""tags"" much of the agencies’ documents – effectively making them available for Google and other search engines to find them. Some 800,000 documents also are available for free that way, spokeswoman Gail Porter said.""As NTIS evolves, its service portfolio will continue to grow by supporting the entire data delivery pipeline for trusted data networks with stringent privacy and security with a focus on increasing access to data, combining data in new ways and delivering better service,"" Porter said.It will be up to Congress to take the information from the NTIS and GAO and decide what’s next.Last spring Sens. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, introduced the Let Me Google That for You bill that would have gutted the NTIS but not killed it outright.That effort cleared the Senate but stalled in the House, opening the door for the bill that Perdue is now co-sponsoring.Perdue’s spokeswoman said Georgia’s freshman senator felt the new bill acknowledges that many government agencies already put their reports online – showing why NTIS is redundant.The bill also would give the Commerce Department a year to phase out the office, so that any ""critical functions"" can be shifted to another division or agency as needed.""It’s outlived its original intent, especially now that every government agency has a website that is, or should be, more accessible and searchable for public records,"" Perdue spokeswoman Megan Whittemore said.Government watchdogs have kept an eye on the debate but rarely lobbied one way or the other.The GAO report, after all, shows that the NTIS often has the older reports that are harder to find online. And it shows value in the expertise to make sure documents are posted online for search engines to find.But Steve Ellis, the vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Congress might be better served making it clear that every government department must start doing that work itself.""The question isn’t about NTIS, but why there are still agencies not putting up their own documents,"" Ellis said. ""Just like how we all went from getting a paycheck to using Direct Deposit, the government has to evolve with the times.""OUR RULINGU.S. Sen. David Perdue said a small government office is spending taxpayer money to print and sell government reports that are available online for free.A 2012 GAO report backs up some of that claim, finding that three-quarters of the National Technical Information Service’s reports were available online.That number reflects a growing trend of government agencies posting their own scientific and technical reports to the Web, where anyone can search and print them out for free.But the claim ignores the fact that the NTIS is responsible for some of the posting and tagging that make those reports easy to find on Google.Perdue’s statement hits on a popular topic, attacking what appears to be government waste.

In June, we found Mostly True the former governor’s declaration that Texas has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country and the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics.That was close to entirely right.Then after that,  the second-time Republican presidential aspirant caught our interest when he said in a July 2, 2015, speech in Washington, D.C.: ""Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013.""As we wrote before, Perry was off by a notch in that Texas in 2012-13 tied for third with Wisconsin for its 88 percent graduation rate, according to a February 2015 federal chart.And did Texas rocket past two dozen states from about a decade before?Hold that thought: To arrive at his claim, Perry did the statistical equivalent of mixing apples and artichokes.That is, the measurement he cited for the No. 27 ranking was not the same measurement used to arrive at Texas’ No. 3 ranking. The more recent ranking reflected each state’s four-year ""adjusted cohort graduation rate,"" based on the ""number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class,"" according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. The center says the size of each potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state.Put another way, if Perry had stuck with the indicator that landed Texas around 27th nationally in 2001-02, he would have ensured accuracy by saying Texas was tied with four states for 22nd in 2011-12, the latest year of available data. A factor in Perry doing otherwise, we speculate, is the metric landing Texas at No. 3 wasn’t universally applied until a few years ago.2001-02Our search for 2002 data started with an email to Perry campaign aides asking about the basis of his comparison; we fielded no reply.When we asked the Texas Education Agency about the state’s 2002 graduation rate, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that the agency did not circulate state-by-state rankings at that time because accurate comparisons were believed to be hard to nail.In 2003, though, the Texas Legislature directed the department to ""compute dropout rates and graduation rates consistent with federal standards and definitions,"" Culbertson said. Nationally, she said, a mandated graduation rate standard was put in place in 2008 in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act (which was approved by Congress in 2001). ""It took some time for many states to develop the data collection and processing systems to calculate a rate based on four years of individual student-level data,"" Culbertson wrote.So, Texas in 2012-13 ranked near the top nationally in its graduation rate by a measure that wasn’t in place in 2002.Responding to our request for data covering earlier years, Culbertson noted that in 2002-03, the year after the one singled out by Perry, Texas ranked 29th nationally, tied with Indiana, for its 75.5 percent ""averaged freshman graduation rate."" New Jersey led the nation with an 87 percent rate.Those rates were calculated, according to the NCES,  by dividing the number of high school students who graduated with a regular high school diploma that year by the average of three enrollments: Grade 8 enrollment five years earlier, Grade 9 enrollment four years earlier and Grade 10 enrollment three years earlierOur search of the center’s website led us to an October 2005 report showing averaged freshman graduation rates in 2001-02, Perry’s cited year. Texas then landed 28th among the states, we found, with a 73.5 percent rate. New Jersey led nationally with an 85.8 percent rate. The report’s introduction touched on how this measurement differs from those that track each student individually, stating that while the averaged freshman graduation rate is not as accurate, it ""can be computed with currently available data.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 20212011-12In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its averaged freshman graduation rate, according to a center chart. The 82 percent rate tied the rates for California, Colorado, Illinois and Kentucky. Vermont and Nebraska tied for first with 93 percent rates.So by this gauge, Texas went from 28th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012.Misleading?We wondered if it mattered that Perry echoed rankings rooted in different calculations. To our inquiries, experts told us his statement was misleading.Grover Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, emailed: ""Perry should have used the same measure to compare graduation rates across the years in question rather than one measure for the beginning year and another measure for the ending year. His statement is misleading.""Whitehurst agreed the yardstick placing Texas third in 2012-13 wasn’t available in 2002. ""It is quite possible to switch measures when discussing different points on the trend line, as the governor did, because of confusion rather than intentional cherry picking of the numbers that make the progress in Texas look best,"" he wrote. The NCES, he said, publishes ""dueling statistics on graduation and completion rates in such a way that a casual reader can easily make the mistake of comparing incommensurate measures.""   By phone, Walt Haney, a retired Boston College professor, called Perry’s dual-method comparison ""potentially extremely misleading. It’s based on different metrics."" Haney said it would have been more meaningful to air the state’s rank in 2002 and 2012 by the been-around-longer ""averaged freshman graduation rate"" indicator.Likewise, Rob Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist, said Perry tapped incompatible metrics.""On the only metric for which you have measurements over time,  there has been little change,"" Warren said by email. ""I infer that not much has changed."" Broadly, Warren said by phone, he also doubts the averaged freshman graduation rate indicator delivers accurate state-to-state comparisons. He said that’s because each state has leeway to define what goes into the rate calculations. Of note, he said, is whether a state as a whole holds back a lot of ninth-grade students. If so, the related graduation rate calculation will distort actual results--to the detriment of the state’s standing.Perry’s claim misleads, Warren said, because the 2013 and 2002 percentages don’t measure the same thing. ""So you may be higher on one, lower on the other, that doesn’t tell you which one is right. They have similar names, purport to measure similar things, but they’re not the same thing,"" he said.Our rulingPerry said: ""Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013.""Texas graduation rates improved while Perry was governor. But this comparison evidently jammed together results reached by different calculations--a statistical no-no leaving the misimpression that Texas galloped past many states on Perry’s watch.It looks to us like Texas actually moved from about 27th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012, according to a measure that compares graduates each year to tallies of students earlier enrolled in lower grades. By a newer gauge tied to tracking individual students, Texas in 2013 tied for third (not No. 2).We rate this claim Mostly False.MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/jun/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-second-best-high-school-/,http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/ACGR_RE_and_characteristics_2012-13.asp,http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/ACGR_2010-11_to_2012-13.asp,http://tea.texas.gov/acctres/DropComp_2006-07.pdf,http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006601.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014391/tables/table_04.asp,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/",,"Education,States,Texas,Rick Perry",,,,,

""If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent.""A reader asked us to check whether Sanders was correct, so we took a closer look. (Sanders seems to have made this a go-to talking point in his campaign; he offered a similar claim in an interview with The Nation.)We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation.For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 percent, for Hispanics it was 20.8 percent and for African-Americans it was 31.8 percent.In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern -- that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said.So what’s going on?Sanders’ camp pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling.And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were ""marginally attached to the labor force."" The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either.The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of ""labor underutilization"" rather than ""unemployment."" EPI itself used the term ""underemployment"" in its research.It’s a real statistic, but Sanders didn’t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term ""unemployment rate"" and once used the variation ""real unemployment rate,"" a vague term that doesn’t have any official definition at BLS and wasn’t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting.On the other hand, Sanders’ choice of statistics actually understated his broader point. Since it’s reasonable to assume that dropouts have an even higher unemployment rate than high-school graduates, the figure for ""young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school,"" as he put it, is probably even higher than 51 percent, since that figure includes only high school graduates.All in all, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology.""He should have been clearer,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""But I think the overall scale is right. Both education and race are predictive of employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities appear to have worse average employment outcomes.""Our rulingSanders said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, ""the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent."" His terminology was off, but the numbers he used check out, and his general point was correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than either Hispanics or whites do.

The state wasn’t out of money and its financial condition didn’t match the definition of ""broke,"" which suggests at or near bankruptcy.What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans.So what about the Occupy Democrats claim that various actions by Walker have left the state ""dead broke""?Behind the claimBefore the group gets to its central point, it lays out a list of assertions that amount to its evidence. Some of them -- education being ""slashed"" and government programs ""gutted"" -- are offered without specifics. In the cases where details are provided, the picture is not always so clean.Take the tax cut.Walker did sign a $541 million tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature on March 24, 2014.The package cut property and income taxes for families and businesses, and zeroed out all income taxes for Wisconsin manufacturers. It also reduced the amount of state taxes withheld from workers’ paychecks.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021Thus, the package wasn’t directed exclusively at ""millionaires and corporations,"" as Occupy Democrats claimed. Citing a memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick noted ""the largest percentage of tax reductions went to those making between $15,000 and $20,000.""At the time the 2014 tax cut was approved, projections showed that the state was on track to have a $1 billion budget surplus in June 2015.Times changed, and so do budget projections.In November 2014, the Walker administration said that surplus had melted into a $132 million shortfall. In January 2015, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said the shortfall was $283 million because tax collections were $173 million lower than expected.To close the gap, in February 2015, Walker's administration said it would skip $108 million in debt payments in May 2015. That, too, was cited as evidence of being broke by Occupy Democrats. Other steps were taken as well, including refinancing of state debt.At the time, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said  under the move the state would only pay the interest on certain obligations. Such a delay is allowed under terms of the borrowing, an administration spokesman said. However, taxpayers would need to make higher principal and interest payments in the future, starting with an additional $19.3 million in the two-year budget that began July 1, 2015.But this deferral strategy is nothing new. It has been employed for years by Walker and previous governors, including his predecessor Democrat Jim Doyle. It’s even got a nickname: ""Scoop and toss"" -- as in scoop up the debt and toss it into the future for others to address.So, while it’s true that Walker skipped a payment, it’s a financing move that’s not unusual, and not an indication of bankruptcy or similar financial calamity.Indeed, the move helped bring the 2013-15 budget into balance.That points us back to the group’s ""dead broke"" claim.In our earlier items, we noted that dictionaries define ""broke"" as ""having no money; bankrupt"" and ""without money; penniless.""But the state is still paying its bills and there has been no indication that it's on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency. Further, under federal law, the state is not allowed to make such a declaration.Said Patrick: ""There is no imbalance and Wisconsin is not ‘dead broke.’ ""Some may find such a statement from Walker’s office ironic. But that does not mean it is inaccurate.Our rating In a Facebook meme, the group Occupy Democrats says Wisconsin is ""dead broke"" because of various actions by Walker and Republicans.Yes, there were tax cuts, and cuts to many programs along the way.

Stanley McChrystal upped the ante recently on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show.  McChrystal, former commander of the U.S. and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan appeared on Hewitt’s show to discuss his new book, Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World.At one point, McChrystal talked about the successes of ISIS's strategy.""ISIS, I think, is a 21st Century manifestation of information technology. Think about their agility on the battlefield … but think about how many people they influence every day with their information operations. They reach about 100 million people a day through various things. They only have (to) recruit a tiny percentage of those to have a real impact.""100 million people? That’s more than the population of Germany. On a daily basis.PunditFact attempted to reach McChrystal through his book publisher, his consultancy and through Twitter but did not hear back.However, according to experts, 100 million seems to be giving ISIS a little too much credit.Earlier this year, PunditFact reached out to J.M Berger, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, to comment on ISIS’s Twitter posts. During that interview, Berger referenced a study he and his colleague, Jonathon Morgan, had been working on. Since then, the full study has been published.In the ISIS Twitter Census, Berger and Morgan uncovered an estimated 46,000 Twitter accounts tied to ISIS supporters. These accounts were found in a time period from September to December 2014.The study also includes that each account had an average of 1,004 followers.In PunditFact’s previous article, Berger placed the estimated total number of tweets per day at about 200,000 (including retweets).In theory, if ISIS-backed accounts sent up to 200,000 tweets a day, and each went to 1,000 people, that would be more than 200 million people reached.But that’s not how it works.For starters, many of the followers overlap. Second, just because someone posts a tweet doesn’t mean it reaches every follower.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Lastly, Twitter has been trying to identify and suspend ISIS-supported accounts. The New York Times reported in April that Twitter had suspended 10,000 ISIS accounts ""for tweeting violent threats.""""A whole lot of those followers overlap, so you can't draw a really reliable conclusion,"" Berger said. ""Also that data is from October, and tens of thousands of accounts have been suspended since then. The numbers are wildly different now.""VOICES from the Blogs, a spin-off of the University of Milan, also confirms this. In its study, Luigi Curini, associate professor of political science, Stefano M. Iacus, professor of probability and mathematical statistics and Andrea Ceron, assistant professor of political science, have tracked ""the aggregate level (of) sentiment toward ISIS by monitoring (Twitter) posts written in Arabic language.""""Assuming that the followers of each ISIS Twitter account are completely unrelated to each other ... is quite unrealistic,"" said Curini.Curini also pointed to the importance of considering the content of the tweets issued by these accounts. ""Some of those tweets are jokes, personal conversations, or contain content that does not express any opinion. That is, not all the 100,000 to 200,000 tweets per day on average are tweets of ‘ISIS propaganda.’ ""Berger also acknowledges that not all tweets influence people.He describes a metric called ""impressions,"" which are a count of ""how many people have a message cross their timeline or how many times a message is otherwise seen or glimpsed.""It is feasible that ISIS could rack up to 100 million impressions a day, but it's not certain. … Scoring an impression is not the same thing as reaching or influencing an audience member,"" Berger said, ""but impressions are how people discover content, so they do count for something. But not necessarily a one-to-one impact; impressions can include the same person returning to content repeatedly.""So not only do followers’ accounts overlap, but the content of messages might not even leave an impact the user who sees it. McChrystal, in his quotation, seemed to be talking about the actual influence ISIS exerts via social media.But what about other social media accounts?""ISIS has a presence on virtually every social media network that is worth having a presence on, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, VKontakte and Google Plus, in significant numbers. They even pop up with the occasional odd account on LinkedIn,"" said Berger.Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be data available yet to measure just how much of an impact ISIS has on these other sites.""Getting data on the presence of ISIS supporters on other social networks is for a number of reasons more complex,"" said Curini. ""According to our monitoring (of Arabic public profiles), Twitter weights between 80 percent to 90 percent of the total presence of ISIS discussion on the net. And we also know that on the other channels on the net, the average support for ISIS is considerably less than on Twitter.""Our rulingMcChrystal said ISIS reaches ""about 100 million people a day through various things.""ISIS certainly has taken its war to social media, and experts agree that their strategy has some bite. But saying ISIS social media posts reach 100 million people a day is, at best, a high-end guesstimate, researchers say. And there are lots of caveats to consider.Thousands of ISIS social media accounts have been shut down in recent months. Followers of ISIS accounts often overlap. And not all the messages sent actually reach every follower, or leave a lasting impression.McChrystal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"" It’s estimated almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS.

We later learned from the group’s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013. The CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing. According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable -- at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports. So what about that statistic?Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021 Vaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital. Not all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady. The physician in charge of Grady’s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years. The other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health. In Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show. We also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012. Nationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012. Most of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said. Our ruling The press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting the week of testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected. That specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported t by the state and CDC. But that still supports the health department’s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment. For that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.","/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"Georgia,Public Health,Fulton County Health and Wellness",,,,,

Scott Walker before the end of June 2015. Walker has not stated a position on the teacher proposal but does have the power to veto individual provisions out of the budget.GOP proposalAs it stands now, public school teachers in Wisconsin must be licensed by the state Department of Public Instruction. A bachelor’s degree from an accredited university is one of the minimum requirements. Teachers must also pass state tests that assess their knowledge of a subject as well as their skills in teaching.Under the GOP proposal, the Department of Instruction would be required to issue teaching licenses to individuals who are deemed qualified by a local school board to teach in middle or high school (sixth through 12th grade), though the license would be good only for that school district.There would be two major changes under this alternative form of licensing.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 20211. Anyone with a bachelor’s degree -- in any subject, and from an accredited or non-accredited university -- could be licensed to teach the so-called core subjects of English, math, social studies or science. The only requirement would be that a school board would have to determine that the person is ""proficient in the subject"" and has ""relevant experience"" in the subject. Unlike the standard licensing system, the teacher would not have to pass any state tests to prove his or her subject knowledge or teaching knowledge.The National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group, and the Education Commission on the States said they did not know how many states have teacher standards like that one.2. For non-core subjects -- such as health or foreign language --  no college degree, or even a high school diploma, would be required. Again, no state tests would be required, only that a school board determine that a person is ""proficient in the subject"" and has ""relevant experience"" in the subject.A memo on the GOP proposal from the Wisconsin Legislative Council, a nonpartisan research agency that serves the Legislature, says that every state requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree for all grades. The only exception is for technical education.In addition, a spokeswoman for the National Council on Teacher Quality told us it knows of no state that doesn't require at least a bachelor's degree.(The only evidence the Democratic Party cited to us to back Tate’s claim was an Associated Press news article saying Wisconsin may be the first state in the country to certify teachers who don't have bachelor's degrees.)The changes were proposed by state Rep. Mary Czaja, R-Irma. She told us she wants schools to be able to hire teachers who can ""fill a niche"" -- for example, hiring a nurse with a two-year degree to teach health, or a local mechanic to teach auto mechanics -- without having to hire a permanent teacher at a higher salary plus benefits. She said she trusts schools to hire people who are competent.Sungti Hsu, of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, said the Wisconsin changes would be significant. Across the country, requiring a bachelor’s degree to teach ""is pretty much a minimum requirement,"" he said. It’s also important for teachers to be trained in both the subject they will teach and as teachers, Hsu said.""If Wisconsin changes their requirements,"" he said, referring to the Republican proposal, ""I’m not sure about the weakest, but it certainly would be one of the lowest requirements.""Our ratingTate declared that a Republican budget proposal ""would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country.""If the proposal becomes law, Wisconsin apparently would become the only state not to have a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for teaching some subjects, including health and foreign languages.

But despite substantial support from both parties, the sweeping national security reform is not without critics.Chief among them is Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who unsuccessfully lobbied to extend bulk metadata collection authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.The metadata program, which allowed National Security Agency officials to collect phone data such as call length and the phone numbers involved, started in 2006 and was kept top-secret until Edward Snowden famously exposed it and other NSA information-gathering initiatives in 2013.The USA Freedom Act, meanwhile, forces the NSA to subpoena phone records from phone companies instead of collecting the data directly.Rubio argued to keep the metadata program as is in a USA Today op-ed May 10. ""There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program,"" Rubio wrote. ""Internet search providers, Internet-based email accounts, credit card companies and membership discount cards used at the grocery store all collect far more personal information on Americans than the bulk metadata program.""The metadata program has not produced a single case of abuse? That’s a strong claim. Does it withstand scrutiny?Well, sort of. It depends on how you define ""abuse.""There are two factors at play here: the actions of the NSA officials enacting the program and the legality of the program itself. First, we’ll discuss those who oversaw the program. Did they ""abuse"" their power?There were certainly glitches in the program, at least. Declassified 2009 documents enumerate a list of what the NSA called ""non-compliance"" instances. In one case, 3,000 phone numbers were found to have been listed as approved under the ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" (RAS) standard without having gone through the proper regulatory channels. In another, phone numbers were automatically added to an alert list without meeting the standard.Although PolitiFact Florida was able to find dozens of such instances, none of the documented cases appeared to demonstrate willful negligence of regulations. Most were corrected almost immediately, and the vast majority involved mishandling technology. As the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) wrote in its 2014 appraisal of the metadata program: ""None of these compliance issues involved significant intentional misuse of the system. Nor has the Board seen any evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of any government officials or agents involved with the program.""""This is one time in my life when I am going to agree with Marco Rubio,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Center for National Security Law. ""You've noted compliance issues, but that's not the same thing as intentional abuse.""Stephen Vladeck, a professor of Law at American University, says he sees the non-compliance issues differently.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview ""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021""If one defines ‘abuse’ to require intentional malfeasance, then it’s a lot harder to show that the phone records program was ever ‘abused,’ "" he said. ""But that’s certainly not how dictionaries define that term or how I have to imagine it’s commonly understood.""A quick look at Webster’s shows ""abuse"" to mean, ""A corrupt practice or custom; improper or excessive use or treatment.""  We found no evidence of corruption but did find evidence of improper treatment.Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, noted that the secretive way the metadata collection program was set up could have allowed for some willful abuses to go unreported. Put simply, there could be some abuses we don't know about.The second question circles around the metadata program itself. Could the bulk metadata program be seen as one big ""abuse"" of Section 215 of the Patriot Act?Rubio’s writes in his op-ed that, ""Despite recent court rulings, this program has not been found unconstitutional, and the courts have not ordered a halt to the program. This program has been found legal and constitutional by at least 15 federal judges serving on the FISA Court on 35 occasions."" These claims are true, but don’t tell the entire story.According to the Second District U.S. Court of Appeals, the metadata program was not permitted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government tried to argue the program was permissible under the ""relevance"" standard of evidence collection because even seemingly immaterial phone data could have theoretically led to relevant information or become relevant in future investigations.""We agree with appellants that such an expansive concept of ‘relevance’ is unprecedented and unwarranted,"" the court wrote. ""The statutes to which the government points have never been interpreted to authorize anything approaching the breadth of the sweeping surveillance at issue here.""The district court said it didn’t feel the need to rule on the constitutionality of the bulk metadata program because it ruled it was not legal according to the original legislation. The court allowed the program to continue only because of the future congressional debate that could ""profoundly alter the legal landscape.""Even the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board -- which found that the program was ""operated in good faith"" -- said there was no legal basis for the bulk collection of data. ""Because the program is not statutorily authorized, it must be ended,"" the board wrote.Our rulingMarco Rubio said, ""There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program."" Rubio’s office did not respond to a request for comment.There are plenty of documented cases of misuse of the metadata collection program. It just depends whether that misuse is what you or Rubio have in mind when you think of abuse. We found no example of intentional misuse of the program.At the least, Rubio should have been more clear in in his op-ed to help readers understand the complexities of the metadata collection program.Rubio’s statement is partially accurate.

Let’s look more closely at this one.First, note the modifier ""structural"" in front of ""surplus.""That’s important. Walker is talking about a particular measure of a budget’s fiscal responsibility, one published regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.It’s usually called the ""structural deficit"" or ""structural surplus,"" but even that name is misleading.The measure is not a prediction of whether the next budget will be in balance. By law it has to be.Rather, it is a tally of the size of the budget challenge lawmakers will face in the following budget (2017-’19) based on the spending and taxing decisions they are making in the upcoming one. Think of it as a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need to balance that 2017-’19 budget.It’s rough because the Fiscal Bureau doesn’t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs.But it gives lawmakers an idea of how decisions they are making might affect state finances going forward.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021The Fiscal Bureau examined Walker’s 2015-’17 budget plan and said it would create a positive balance of $300 million in year one of that 2017-19 budget and another $199 million in year two. This is the report that Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick cited to back up his claim.That adds up to $499 million, as Walker said. His own budget document published a similar number.Behind the numbersMuch of the ""structural surplus"" traces to Walker’s proposed cut in aid for local school districts and to timing factors in the way Walker funds school tax credits, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.""You generally run into structural problems when, in the second year of the budget, spending is greater than ongoing revenues,"" Knapp said. ""That is not the case in the governor’s proposal.""Another expert agreed with the numbers, but found fault with how Walker phrased the deficit number as a done deal, when it’s not through the Legislature yet.""He assumes that the budget will pass exactly as he proposed it, and we all know that won’t happen,"" said Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families’ Wisconsin Budget Project. ""Even the governor has been urging changes to the budget.""That’s a fair point; the budget is still in the sausage-making stage.Peacock raised a larger criticism of using the structural imbalance number as a measure of the state’s fiscal condition.Lawmakers and governors have learned how to game a once-useful tool, he said. For instance, Peacock said, Walker’s budget unrealistically assumes a popular form of school aids will disappear in the following two-year budget.Knapp, too, called the school aid change ""a bit of an accounting trick"" that seems designed only to inflate the size of the structural surplus.Our ratingWalker said a sign of his restoring fiscal responsibility was that ""For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million.""A reliable, independent source made that estimate, so the figure is solid.

Rob Wittman is trying to thwart the Pentagon’s efforts to begin a new round of military base closing.There have been five rounds of closures in recent decades, starting in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. military retooled for a post-Cold War mission. The last round took place in 2005 and talk of new spate is worrying congressmen who have bases in their districts.Wittman, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 1st District which includes the Army’s Fort A.P. Hill and the Marine base in Quantico. He recently questioned whether a new round of the Base Realignment and Closure program -- known as BRAC -- made strategic and economic sense.""We cannot forget that the 2005 BRAC round has not yet resulted in savings,"" he stated in an April 30 news release.We checked to see if he was right about the lacking of savings.Gordon Neal, Wittman’s spokesman, sent us a 2009 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that examined the bottom line of the 2005 BRAC, which shuttered 24 bases, realigned 24 others and eliminated about 12,000 civilian jobs.Calculations in the report were based on a Pentagon estimate that the 2005 BRAC would save Uncle Sam $3.9 billion a year -- an estimate that the GAO said is probably high.The GAO also noted that the military spent $35 billion implementing BRAC, far above the original $21 billion estimate. For example, it cost $1.7 billion more than expected to close Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington and move its operations to Fort Belvoir, Va. and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.A chart in the report shows the annual savings started in 2006, but those economies weren’t expected to be enough to pay off the upfront costs of BRAC until 2018, five years later than originally projected.The GAO updated its analysis in 2012 and found that the savings and cost estimates were still about the same. That’s the last time the agency did a cost analysis of the 2005 BRAC.""So 2018 should still be about the time that the savings would exceed the cost,"" Brian Lepore,  GAO’s director of defense capabilities and management, wrote in an email.We spoke to two defense budget analysts and they both told us that Wittman’s statement is correct that the U.S. hasn’t yet pocketed ""net savings"" from the realignment.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 26, 2021 in a viral video""In March 2020 the United States deployed 30,000 troops to Europe to ... free child-trafficked children and arrest deep state cabal members.""By Madison Czopek • January 29, 2021But that doesn’t mean the program isn’t paying off. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the last round of BRAC is producing savings but, for the moment, they’re going towards recovering the costs of implementing the program.""We are going to hit the break even point, and after that it’s all savings,"" Harrison told us.Harrison was among nearly 40 defense analysts who late last month signed a letter supporting the Pentagon’s call for another round of closings, saying there are surplus military installations around the nation.Harrison said Wittman’s use of the 2005 BRAC to argue against another round is off base.The last realignment round was different from the four that came in the 1980s and 1990s, Harrison said, because it focused much more heavily on base consolidations than previous rounds that were mostly directed at merely shuttering facilities. Consolidations are more expensive, he said, because they entail moving operations from one place to another, which means buildings have to be constructed.In 2012, Dorothy Robyn, then deputy under secretary of defense, made the same point in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee.""In short, the 2005 round took place during a period of growth in the military, and it reflected the goals and needs of that time. Because the focus was on transforming installations to better support forces -- as opposed to saving money and space -- it is a poor gauge of the savings that the Department can achieve through another BRAC round,"" she stated in written testimony.Robyn said the previous BRAC rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995 totaled $8 billion in annual savings.Our rulingWittman said that the 2005 BRAC round has ""not resulted in savings.""Savings are coming in every year, but they haven’t yet reached the break-even point of paying back the costs of BRAC. That’s expected to happen in 2018 and, after that, the money can be used for other purposes.Wittman’s statement is missing important information and creates a faulty impression that the 2005 BRAC has been a loser.On the whole, we rate his claim Half True.","http://www.wittman.house.gov/latest-news/wittman-supports-committee-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fy16/,http://www.gao.gov/assets/100/96471.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/troops-werent-sent-europe-free-trafficked-children/,http://csbaonline.org/2015/04/29/thirty-eight-think-tank-experts-urge-defense-reform/,http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/robyn_BRAC_hearing_testimony%2008mar2012.pdf",,"Federal Budget,Military,Virginia,Rob Wittman",,,,,

There are studies on both sides of that debate.To pick one that supports Wallace’s view, researchers looked at four years of data on Pennsylvania schools. In 2010, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education in Philadelphia compared spending in nearly 500 school districts to 11th grade test results. The strongest predictor of high scores was the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree. F.

""But the results are very weak.""The report said ""Spending per pupil, regardless of expenditure category, had either no association with student achievement or at best only a weak positive or a weak negative correlation with student achievement. ""On the other hand, professors at Northwestern University and the University of California-Berkeley looked at four decades in school districts where spending increased under court order. In a report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they said that for low income children who spent all 12 years in schools where spending rose at least 20 percent, graduation rates rose by 23 percentage points.There were also ""25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty.""

Tim Kaine commemorated the eighth anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings that left 32 dead with a call for stronger gun laws.""It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check,"" Kaine, D-Va., said during an April 16 floor speech. We asked Kaine’s office for the source of the statistic. Sarah Peck, his press secretary, pointed to a 1997 study by the U.S. National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey that asked them how they acquired their weapons. The researchers concluded 60 percent of the guns were bought from federally licensed firearm dealers and therefore subject to background checks.Federal licensed sellers have to conduct background checks before sales, individual private sellers and gift givers do not. The co-authors of the study had released a more detailed report on their gun owners’ survey in 1996, estimating that between 30-40 percent of all guns transactions occurred through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check isn’t required.The 40 percent figure has been long offered by gun control advocates as evidence that the nation needs tighter background check laws. But there’s been much debate about the research, conducted by Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, including: The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about gun their acquisitions going back two years.Some of the participants made gun purchases prior to the Brady Act, when they were not required to undergo federal background checks.Only a small group of gun owners -- 251 people -- answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns, answering ""probably"" or ""probably not"" on whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer.The 40 percent figure included transactions when a firearm was not sold but, for example, inherited or given as a gift. When the Fact Checker at The Washington Post asked Ludwig in 2013 to boil down the 1994 data, the researcher said that between 14 to 22 percent of the guns were purchased without background checks.The survey is almost 21 years old and begs a question: What’s the modern-day percentage of guns sold without a background check? Cook pointed us to an editorial he and Ludwig wrote about the 40 percent statistic for the National Review in the aftermath of the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of that 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote.

President Barack Obama in 2013 signed an executive order to get the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to reexamine gun violence. The research is in progress. There’s debate among researchers about whether the two-decade old figure on gun purchases without background checks remains reliable. Some, like Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida, say it is. ""That 40 percent without a background check is a pretty good estimate,"" said Corzine, who has researched crime prevention and the role of firearms in violence. ""I have no quarrel with it.""The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, is less certain. The think tank said in a 2013 report that the figure has ""clear limitations"" given its age, and the fact that it comes from a survey of a small group of gun owners.""Proponents of universal background checks, including this report’s authors, would be well served by acknowledging the limitations of the statistic,"" the center wrote. Our rulingKaine says ""it’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check.""His source is a small-sample survey that’s almost 21 years old. It counted some firearms that were purchased before a law went into effect requiring federal background checks for many gun sales.The 1994 survey measured gun transactions, which included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold -- the term Kaine uses -- only 14 to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., finds a microphone these days, you can expect him to harp on the erosion of the American middle class.Sanders, who has said he is considering a 2016 presidential run and caucuses with Democrats, made a striking point about the country’s income inequality over the last 40 years in an April 19 interview on Fox News Sunday.""What we're seeing, Chris, right now is that for 40 years, the American middle class has been disappearing. Millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages despite a huge increase in technology and productivity,"" Sanders said. ""And what we have seen during that period is a massive transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of America — massive wealth and income inequality, where you have 99 percent of all new income today going to the top 1 percent.""With the financial rift between everyday and mega-rich Americans poised to dominate the 2016 White House race, PolitiFact wanted to examine Sanders’s statement about 99 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent.The research behind the claimSanders used a similar line about the top 1 percent taking home 99 percent of all new income during a Brookings Institution speech a couple months ago, saying, ""In fact, the latest information that we have shows that in recent years, over 99 percent of all new income generated in the economy has gone to the top 1 percent.""The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded that claim One Pinocchio, a designation for claims that include in part a ""selective telling of the truth."" Sanders did not agree with the conclusion and doubled down on the accuracy of his claim in a displeased letter.Sanders’ office told us the senator was talking about pre-tax income growth from 2009-13 during his Fox interview. A Sanders spokesman highlighted a New York Times Upshot article in January by Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.Wolfers based his calculations on the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who uses pre-tax income reported on Internal Revenue Service filings in his studies of top incomes, including capital gains. Saez and French economist Thomas Piketty have written about the disparate recovery from the recession among America’s two big income classes for several years. Saez found most recently that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12.Using Saez’s preliminary 2013 numbers, Wolfers stretched the window to account for an average of 2012-13 incomes (He used an average for those years because tax rates on top earners increased in 2013, prompting some to shift more income to 2012.).The takeaway?The average income for the richest 1 percent of Americans, excluding capital gains, rose from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 from 2012-13, he wrote. The 99 percent, on the other hand, experienced a drop in average incomes from $44,000 to $43,900, Wolfers said. The calculation excludes government benefits in the form of Social Security, welfare, tax credits, food stamps and so on.""That is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent,"" Wolfers wrote for the New York Times post.Sanders spokesman Jeff Frank said his office double-checked the statistic with Wolfers, who double-checked his own work with Saez.Saez told PolitiFact that the key to understanding the statistic is knowing that it’s measuring pre-tax, pre-government benefit income.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021""That's the key stat to think about how the market allocates incomes in the first place,"" Saez said. ""Anybody should be worried that the recovery from the Great Recession has been so skewed in terms of market incomes.""Other points to considerOther economists argue that the more comprehensive way to talk about income is by looking at earnings after taxes and how government alters the income picture. That measure is called net or disposable income.Under this measure, the income differences are not as badly skewed, Saez said.That’s because on one side, government programs are making life easier for low-income Americans through things such as Social Security, unemployment compensation, veterans’ benefits, food stamps, welfare, housing assistance, health subsidies, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, said Brookings Institution fellow Gary Burtless.At the same time, tax policy has become more progressive since 2009 through lower taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans and higher taxes for higher earners.The drawback with this analysis, however, is it does not reflect how people are ""sharing directly in the rewards of the market,"" said Urban Institute fellow Eugene Steuerle, who has written about the different definitions of income. For Steuerle, all of the numbers matter, though each one holds a different meaning depending on the policy question.Steuerle is a fan of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, which he said offers a more comprehensive look at the income gap by including labor, business, capital and retirement income. Another way to think of it is comparing living standards.In November 2014, CBO released a study of household income taxes, which compared income growth after taxes since 1977. The problem is it only goes up to 2011, so we cannot compare it to the 2009-13 market measure. Other researchers have probed inequality in income growth over other time periods (a couple detailed here), but they do not apply to Sanders’s recovery timeframe.""Is there a lot of inequality in living standards after tax and transfers? The right data to answer that question is simply unavailable for recent years,"" Wolfers said.Often, income inequality measures do not account for health care, the costs of which are often employer-paid and can level the playing field between low- and middle-income earners and the super rich, Steuerle said.Another point to keep in mind: The country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession — a point that Sanders’s claim does not account for because it picks up with the recovery, Burtless said.To Burtless, Sanders’s estimate is correct in the narrow way he meant it but would be overstated under a broader income definition that extends pre-2009.Our rulingSanders said that ""99 percent of all new income (is) going to the top 1 percent.""Sanders is referring to pre-tax, pre-transfer income growth during the economic recovery from 2009-13.We found consensus among economists that the statistic and calculation offered by Sanders is credible, but it’s just not the only way to consider income inequality. Other measures may be equally valid and produce different results. But economists say specific data does not yet exist.Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional notes of context.

At least 11 states besides Georgia limit session length by counting legislative days.The remaining states operate by calendar days or specific dates that lawmakers can meet, said Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the group.""You used to see tactics, like covering the clock or holding it from moving, but the courts have ruled you can’t do that,"" Erickson said. ""And that really applies to those states with a date-specific or calendar day count. ""So that famous 1964 photo of state Rep. Denmark Groover from Macon hanging off the House railing, trying to stop the clock during a heated debate on congressional redistricting?It didn’t matter. The clock crashed to the floor in the stunt – but the session continued.Likewise, when House Speaker Tom Murphy grew angry at the governor and state Senate in the 1980s, he was able to stop all business with an adjournment vote before dinnertime, said former state legislator George Hooks, a Democrat from Americus.""It has never created a problem in the past,"" Hooks said. ""You work as needed. You try to make it before midnight, but it doesn’t end until that gavel comes down and we say ‘sine die.’ ""So the state Senate’s wee hour vote last week? Ralston implied that there is a midnight deadline for action.Most years, the chambers do end their work before midnight. Legal experts in the state and nationally agree, though, that no such clock watching is needed.Lawmakers meet for 40 legislative days, which end only when the chambers adjourn.We rule Ralston’s statement False.","/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/",,"Georgia,States,Transparency,David Ralston",,,,,

She is no fan of the former New York mayor and conservative pundit, especially after he loudly questioned President Barack Obama’s love for the United States.HBO host Bill Maher got an earful on the subject when he invited Lebowitz to appear in a panel about Giuliani’s rhetoric. Lebowitz said the explanation for Giuliani’s remarks is simple: His policies have been racist since his first election when he campaigned on a nostalgic 1950s-era platform, and this racism extended to longstanding disparate treatment of blacks and whites by the New York Police Department.""When Giuliani was the mayor, every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back. Constantly, you know, and it was always a different excuse from the cops,"" she said. "" ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a candy bar. ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a keychain.""Maher said, ""Well, that hasn't changed, and that's not just New York.""""In the entire time I've lived in New York, which has been many decades, not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police,"" Lebowitz said. ""Not one. Not one. You think the odds would be? Not one. So that is the reason they're shot, period.""Lebowitz made two claims — that ""every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back,"" and ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police"" in the entire time Lebowitz has lived in New York. A reader asked us to hone in on the second claim, brushing off the first as hyperbole.Contacting LebowitzLebowitz moved to New York City from New Jersey sometime in the late 1960s. Our rough math: She was born in 1950, and this New York Times profile says she moved there after high school.So, to Lebowitz, an unarmed white person has not been shot by New York police in at least about 45 years.We reached her through representatives at the Steven Barclay Agency. Sara Bixler told PunditFact, ""Fran Lebowitz tells me that to her knowledge, this is true — she meant it non-hyperbolically. She said that if she is wrong, she would like to know, of course.""No simple dataThe difficulty in judging Lebowitz's statement is that there is no comprehensive database that details police shootings across the country, much less New York City. That means there is no go-to source that shows shootings by race and whether those shot were unarmed or armed.Reporting to the FBI is optional, and most of the country’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies choose not to report. The gap in data gained prominence after last fall’s shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo.The New York Police Department likely can prove Lebowitz right or wrong. But the agency ignored our calls and emails spread out over more than five weeks. Our request was ""under consideration"" six days after the first email we sent Feb. 25. NYPD did not respond to our March 26 query for information.An early 1970s studySo what information is available?We located a study of NYPD officer shootings from 1971 to 1975 by James J. Fyfe. His study, ""Shots Fired,"" spans 700 pages and relies on access to detailed NYPD shooting incident records.Fyfe broke down the shootings by race and by weapon. More than half of the black residents who were shot by police were carrying a handgun, compared to 48 percent of Hispanics and 32 percent of whites.The white ""opponents,"" as Fyfe calls them, were more likely to be shot while not carrying a weapon or while using physical force.Crucially for this fact-check, Fyfe's data show 56 whites were unarmed when police shot at them during those years (1971-75), and another 34 whites were shot when using physical force. Of the more than 1,800 primary opponents of police shootings during those years, 19 percent were white, 58 percent were black, and 23 percent were Hispanic.""She is simply wrong about unarmed whites ‘never’ being shot,"" said David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis criminology professor who tracks police use of deadly force around the country.However, Fyfe’s report does include holes pivotal to our specific question. We can’t drill down on the circumstances in which the white residents ended up getting shot at by police. Racial categories are also very difficult to assess sometimes.And we can't ask Fyfe, who died in 2006.""Is a Spanish-speaking white person ‘Hispanic’ and thus non-white? Are English-speaking biracial people from immigrant backgrounds non-white?"" said Candace McCoy, City University of New York criminology professor (McCoy and Fyfe were married). ""New York is so incredibly diverse. It's hard to find people who are unequivocally what we consider as ‘white’ sometimes.""What NYPD data says and doesn’t sayNYPD has released an annual report outlining officers’ firearm discharges since 1971. That was a particularly brutal year for both shootings of cops (47 injured, 12 killed) as well as the number of people shot and killed by police (221 injured, 93 people killed).Those numbers have fallen substantially since the 1970s. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, three officers were shot and none was killed, and officers shot 17 people and killed eight.We found several, but not all, reports online. And of the ones we found, many did not include critical racial data.The last chart in the appendix of recent reports outlines ""intentional discharges"" of firearms during adversarial conflicts, as well as the race and age of the person involved. Most often, this is when an officer shoots at a person armed with a gun in self-defense, though there are also categories for shootings of subjects with imitation firearms, threat or use of knives and other cutting objects, blunt instruments, or a final category called ""use/threaten the use of overwhelming physical force.""""Overwhelming physical force"" covers times when an unarmed person physically attacks or threatens to attack an officer, such as gang assaults, pushing an officer from a roof or subway train platform, or trying to take the officer’s firearm.We compiled the following chart, filling in blanks for the number of whites shot each year and how many were unarmed if reports were available online. We could only go back to 1995.As you can see, many did not have the information we need.YearNumber of whites shotNumber whites unarmed201320201230201170201050Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 202120090020082020072unknown2006no race data kept 2005no race data kept 2004no race data kept 2003no race data kept 2002no race data kept 2001no race data kept 2000no race data kept 1999no race data kept 1998no race data kept 199726unknown199632unknown Some observations after scouring the NYPD reports:• Whites are shot at less frequently than blacks and Hispanics.• The whites who were shot at by police were allegedly carrying a firearm, a blunt weapon, imitation gun, threatening others with weapons, or using their vehicles as weapons.• And most importantly in this quest, several years’ reports did not include information on the race of the victim.The last point was a bone of contention with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which in 2008 complained before the city council about the police not reporting the race of victims since 1998. The department was, however, reporting on the breed of dogs its officers shot.""That the department is providing more information about the dogs it is shooting at than people who are its intended targets is deeply disturbing and must be connected,"" the NYCLU said.We will note that these years cover some of Giuliani’s mayoral tenure from 1994 to 2001.The department has offered more descriptive accounting of officer-involved shootings in recent years after pressure from the NYCLU and media coverage.Other ideasWe searched news articles from New York and found no case that explicity fits Lebowitz's criteria. We also consulted several experts on criminology and police shooting statistics looking for additional information. James Acker, a University of Albany-SUNY College of Criminal Justice professor, pointed us to a New York Daily News investigation that found in 179 officer-involved shootings, 86 percent of victims when race was known were either black or Hispanic. But we still do not know what percentage were white with certainty and whether they were armed. Fewer than one-third of the people who died were unarmed, as examined by the Daily News.Acker also suggested New York's vital statistics reports for deaths caused by legal interventions and then sorting by race/ethnicity.Using that tool, we know 15 whites were shot by police in the city from 2000 (the earliest starting point for the database) to 2012. That’s an undercount from the chart above. But we do not know whether they were armed.Contrary to Lebowitz’s broader point, Klinger notes, police violence actually fell under Giuliani. Victims in police shootings by NYPD cops fell from 90 people (29 fatals) in 1994 to 30 people in 2001 (11 fatal), Klinger said, citing his own records.D. Brian Burghart, editor and publisher of the Reno News & Review, created his own website, Fatal Encounters, to document fatal police shooting. Using his database, we found about a dozen examples of former, off-duty and current New York City police officers fatally shooting white people or killing them with their cars in accidents from pursuits or driving while intoxicated and off-duty. But most were armed with knives, guns or other weapons, or were killed during vehicle pursuits. Many showed signs of mental illness. There were no examples of an unarmed person being shot by a cop.Our rulingLebowitz said, ""Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police"" since she has lived in New York.This was a bear of fact-check to wrestle to the ground, in part because of the lack of cooperation from the New York Police Department, in part because we were looking at a time period that spanned about 45 years, and in part because it is clear that African-Americans and Hispanics were clearly shot at by New York police much more than whites.All that said, an analysis of police data show police shot dozens of unarmed white people during the early 1970s, the early side of Lebowitz’s life in New York City. While we wish we had complete data on police shootings by each victim’s race and armed status for the 1980s on, we don’t necessarily need it to judge Lebowitz’s particular statement.It is very accurate to say blacks are shot at more often by police than whites. But that is not what Lebowitz said. She said ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot,"" and that is not true.We rate her claim False.Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

If the amendment is approved, customers could buy electricity from solar installers and not just utility companies. We’ve written about it before here.At a March 10, 2015, news conference, AFP members said the amendment was misguided. They backed up their point of view by implying Georgia’s solar policies are ""burdensome and expensive government mandates"" that shouldn’t be emulated, and cited a Louisiana study that solar power would be very expensive to implement.AFP Florida followed up the conference with a release that read, ""In Georgia, similar net metering policies have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable.""Is it true that energy regulations in Georgia -- often cited as a leader in implementing new solar policies -- have made electric rates go up? Time to rate the rates.Electric moveIt turns out we’ll be taking a quick look at Louisiana, too, because that’s the state AFP meant to name when citing net metering. They apologized and said they would correct the release, thanking PolitiFact for pointing out the error. We’ll be discussing both states for this check.What is net metering, anyway? In simplest terms, it’s the process of selling self-generated electricity, such as the power made by solar panels on your house, back to a utility company for a credit. The proposed Florida amendment doesn’t really concern itself with that, but rather removes a roadblock to buying power from someone other than a registered electric provider, like Duke Energy or Florida Power & Light. Right now, if a solar provider wants to sell its power, it must sell it to one of these utilities.Critics say being able to end this monopoly is key to expanding solar efforts in Florida, which is ranked 13th in solar installations by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Florida also is one of five states that specifically outlaw buying solar power directly from a provider. The others are Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Georgia.While Georgia isn’t trying to open the market the same way the Florida amendment would, the Peach State is enjoying its own moment in the sunshine on the subject of solar.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021The state in 2008 offered homeowner tax credits to boost solar installations, a program that expired in 2014.The Georgia Public Service Commission worked with the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power, to create the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative in 2012.The utility created programs to let businesses and homeowners sell solar energy to Georgia Power, as well as working out power-purchase agreements with big solar developers. The plan has been called a success by advocates, the state’s PSC and electric providers, and plans for expanding the amount of solar power in the state are in the works.Georgia Power has said there has been no ""upward pressure on consumer rates."" Spokesman John Kraft told PolitiFact Florida that from the beginning, part of the initiative was that the company would be able to buy solar-generated electricity at or below rates it would cost the company for traditional means, such as electricity generated by burning fossil fuels or using nuclear power. The program was voluntary from the beginning and not a state mandate.""There isn’t a regulation per se that says you have to do this amount,"" Kraft said. ""The PSC had been asking us for ways to do more solar.""So what about Louisiana? AFP Florida told us that’s really the place that saw higher electric rates because of solar policies. They cited a 2015 study for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which was debating what to charge solar power customers for electricity. The report focused on the state’s 50 percent tax credit for installing new solar panels, and said those credits cost the state at least $89 million.The study became controversial because the study’s author -- consultant and Louisiana State University energy studies professor David Dismukes -- had written favorably about the oil and gas industries before. Solar advocates called the report biased for not focusing on the jobs the industry had created and misrepresenting how the state’s tax credits work.Setting aside the controversy over the study, Louisiana customers outside of New Orleans did see a base rate hike in 2014, which cost the average ratepayer about 47 cents per month. But that increase was approved by the PSC in 2013 and was over several issues, including the cost of maintaining an aging power grid. Electric utility company Entergy did not specifically mention solar as being an issue when announcing the base rate change.Last year, Louisiana voted to end its 50 percent tax credit for solar installations in 2017. Gov. Bobby Jindal is considering cutting it sooner to fill a $1.6 billion budget gap this year.So while Louisiana did see a rate increase, we don’t see evidence that it was specifically related to a solar initiative.Our rulingAmericans for Prosperity Florida said recent solar energy policies in Georgia ""have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable.""The group admitted it meant to say Louisiana, which is having its own debate on the issue. But the program in Georgia is thriving. Part of Georgia's implementation plan was that using solar power wouldn’t affect rates, and it hasn’t, Georgia’s largest utility said. Louisiana did see a rate increase, but it doesn't seem to be specifically related to a solar initiative.The statement is completely wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.","http://floridiansforsolarchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/64491-1.pdf,https://youtu.be/ALaSQCzFDwQ,http://americansforprosperity.org/florida/article/americans-for-prosperity-proposed-solar-policies-are-not-free-market/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/post-about-keystone-pipeline-falsely-claims-buffet/,http://lpscstar.louisiana.gov/star/ViewFile.aspx?Id=f2b9ba59-eaca-4d6f-ac0b-a22b4b0600d5,http://blogs.theadvocate.com/specialreports/2014/12/06/giving-away-louisiana-solar-energy-tax-credit/,http://www.entergy.com/news_room/newsrelease.aspx?NR_ID=2819",,"Energy,Florida,Americans for Prosperity: Florida",,,,,

Jeb Bush.American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record.""Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails,"" the American Bridge website read.Does Florida’s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state’s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there’s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails.Mail callBush famously used the personal email address [email protected] for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run.In February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor.But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked.First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn’t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn’t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office.The Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records ""at the expiration of his or her term of office."" Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014. The last batch is described as ""Additional 2002-2003 emails.""Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush’s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the [email protected] address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February.As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn’t. The PAC told us that’s comparable to Hillary Clinton’s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We’ll leave it to readers to decide what’s hypocritical and what’s not.)Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021Bush’s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements.""Governor Bush complied with Florida’s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. ""His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time.""The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are several emails from donors posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a private server.But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush’s self-selection and Clinton’s current dilemma, we found nothing to suggest Bush’s editing had violated Florida’s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to determine which emails go into the public record based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them.Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen.  ""There’s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts,"" Petersen said about rules in Florida. ""Some agencies have policies discouraging the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office.""If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush’s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something’s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said.Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He’s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals.""Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that,"" Allison said. ""I’m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply.""Our rulingAmerican Bridge said ""Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose.""Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesn’t note one important point: State law allows him to do that.The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

(Jolly said September, but his spokesman said he had simply mixed up the dates with a press conference about Syria.)The 2014 action, referred to as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (sometimes called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, or DAPA for short), let qualified immigrants apply for work permits and to avoid deportation for three years at a time. The applicants had to pass background checks and pay a fee.More than 4 million people were estimated to qualify under the DAPA executive action, which built upon Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That initiative protected ""dreamers,"" people who had been brought to the United States illegally as children and had no criminal record.DAPA in the courtsAs of this writing, the November executive action is on hold indefinitely. On Feb. 16, a day before the action was to take effect, Texas U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunction stopping the action from being carried out. He was hearing a Texas case that included 26 states (including Florida) challenging Obama’s announcement. Hanen said the change would be a burden on states, writing ""no statute gives the DHS the discretion it is trying to exercise here.""This is the portion of the ruling Jolly first cited when we asked him what he meant. Hanen had ruled ""that the president and his secretary acted legislatively by creating new law regarding immigration enforcement,"" and thereby violated the constitutional separation of powers, Jolly told PolitiFact Florida in a statement.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021But several experts in immigration policy and constitutional law disagreed with Jolly’s assessment. The impression a reasonable person could make from Jolly’s statement is that a federal judge ruled the action unconstitutional, which is not the case.The states bringing the case did argue the action was unconstitutional -- a point Hanen discussed at length in his opinion, but explicitly said he would not rule on. Hanen said Texas had proven its grievance enough for the case to proceed, but not because the action was unconstitutional.Instead, the judge said the action violated something called the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, which Hanen interpreted as specifying the president should have formally posted a public notice in the Federal Register about the action and held a public comment period before enacting it. The Justice Department will take the case to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.""The more correct formulation would be that ‘A federal judge has said it’s illegal,’ "" Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian said.We did find a separate instance in which a federal judge said Obama’s executive action was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab in Pennsylvania said in a Dec. 16, 2014, ruling that ""President Obama’s unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and, therefore, is unconstitutional.""That case, though, was about whether Obama’s executive action applied to the defendant, a Honduran immigrant who was in the process of being deported for being in the country illegally. Schwab said the defendant could change his plea and face trial under the executive action, but the immigrant declined and was deported because the action doesn’t apply in criminal cases.Schwab’s position doesn’t set precedent, Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky said, because it’s just the judge’s opinion and not a ruling. (Jolly said he agreed with Schwab’s characterization after we asked about it.)Lastly, Washington D.C. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rejected the argument of Schwab and others in December when she threw out a lawsuit from Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, in which the sheriff called Obama’s executive action unconstitutional. Howell ruled Arpaio couldn’t prove the action harmed the sheriff’s department and that deferred action was a congressionally approved method of enforcing policy, and therefore constitutional.""Any party can raise an alleged constitutional violation,"" Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said. ""Only when the Supreme Court rules on the executive action’s constitutionality will that issue be resolved once and for all.""Our rulingJolly said a federal judge called Obama’s executive action on immigration ""unconstitutional.""A reasonable person may think Jolly meant a judge ruled the action violated the Constitution, but that isn’t accurate. A federal judge in Texas said the government was acting outside its authority by issuing the order. But the actual ruling said the state of Texas had a chance to win a case based on a procedural misstep, not the action’s constitutionality.Another federal judge in Pennsylvania really did call the action unconstitutional, but that was an opinion in a ruling on a deportation case in which the action didn’t apply.Jolly's statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-passes-bill-fully-funding-the-department-of-homeland-security/2015/03/03/9d62484a-c1c5-11e4-9ec2-b418f57a4a99_story.html,https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_deferred_action.pdf,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1668197-hanen-opinion.html,/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/,https://epic.org/open_gov/Administrative-Procedure-Act.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2014/12/Juarez-Escobar.pdf,https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/24/arpaios-immigration-lawsuit-against-obama-thrown-out-of-court",,"Immigration,Homeland Security,Florida,David Jolly",,,,,

While proponents of the policy shift argue that the changes won’t spur additional fees or taxes, opponents argue the opposite.""This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an email through the anti-FCC regulation group Protect Internet Freedom.On the other hand, FCC spokesperson Kim Hart told PolitiFact that the policy ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period.""Who’s right here? Estimates of the impact on consumers -- in terms of Internet service bill fees and taxes -- range from $0 to $11 billion. Politicians can make a case that the policy will bump up service bills for the 85 million households with Internet, but there are too many unknowns to make such a definitive statement as Lee’s.The proposalNet neutrality is complicated. In general, it’s the idea that Internet service providers (like Comcast) should not be able give preferential treatment to one website over another.Accordingly, the solution is also complex. The FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they will be treated as public utilities, like phone service -- subject to more regulation than they are now. (A previous fact-check covered this in more detail.)The full text of the proposal wasn’t available to the public before the vote, when Lee made his comments, though its general principles were widely understood. But, a fact sheet says it ""will not impose, suggest or authorize any new taxes or fees.""More importantly, Congress recently reauthorized the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans new taxes on Internet service. There’s legislation in the works to make this law permanent. That means the FCC couldn't levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to. There’s a big caveat, though. The Internet Tax Freedom Act bans taxes, but not fees. Fee revenue is set aside specifically for, in this case, a telecom-related service. Taxes, in contrast, raise general revenue. They’re legally different, but functionally the same from the consumer’s perspective. Many experts say consumers can expect additional fees.Some say the FCC has left the door open for attaching federal-level fees in the future. Regardless, the FCC can’t stop states and municipalities from tacking on their own fees.The estimatesFeatured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021The nationwide annual impact on Internet broadband subscriber bills could reach a maximum $11 billion, as a result of new taxes and fees, according to a December report out of the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank (it identifies with former President Bill Clinton’s New Democrats). They recently lowered their estimate from $15 billion.For the study, the researchers assumed that state and local governments would take every fee currently applied to a telecom service and apply them to internet service -- because household Internet will become a telecom service.For example, the state of California charges telecom companies fees for special telecom-related services for the deaf and disabled, among other programs. Companies then pass these fees along to consumers.It makes sense that a state would want to apply already-established telecom fees to Internet service to increase revenue, said study author Hal Singer, in an interview with PolitiFact. He pointed out that Vermont’s director of telecom services has said the state would strongly consider levying fees on broadband Internet for the purpose of increasing Internet accessibility.Some net neutrality experts take issue with the study because of what the authors chose to include or leave out.""The PPI study has been thoroughly discredited,"" said Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the Open Technology Institute, noting that it was ""disingenuous"" of the study to ignore the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the first place.There is no guarantee that every state would choose to levy every fee. In some states, the legislatures would have to take action before it could happen. The report also assumes that federal fees will apply, but that’s still up in the air.Taking a different look at the PPI findings, the Free Press advocacy group argues that the potential fee burden could be around $4 billion, or as little as nothing. (Though Singer fervently rebutts their argument.)Personal finance website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion impact. They broke their estimates down by state and found that households would see an annual increase in their Internet service bills anywhere between $8 in Delaware and $131 in Pennsylvania. They estimate that the average American household will see their bill increase $67 annually.""I’d say claiming that this order will be a ‘massive tax on the middle class,’ is an overstatement,"" said Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. ""But it is also true that we will likely see new fees on broadband as a result of reclassification.""Our rulingLee said the FCC’s net neutrality policy ""is essentially a massive tax increase.""Literally, there won’t be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. There’s a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year.

This is the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year.

Is Homeland Security all alone in going unfunded through the fiscal year running through September 2015?Doggett’s factual backupBy email, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale cited a Dec. 10, 2014, Congressional Quarterly news story referring to 11 spending measures that had made it through Congress with only a ""continuing resolution"" approved to maintain Homeland Security funding for a few months.And on Dec. 16, 2014, she noted, the White House announced President Barack Obama had signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, ""which provides fiscal year 2015 full-year appropriations through September 30, 2015, for all agencies except the Department of Homeland Security, for which appropriations are provided instead through February 27, 2015.""Congressional actionsThen again, news accounts suggest there’s room for Homeland Security funding to be worked out.In early 2015, the Republican-majority House advanced a measure funding Homeland Security through the fiscal year. A Jan. 9, 2015, press release from the House Appropriations Committee said the fiscal 2015 Homeland Security funding measure, described as the ""last of the 12 annual funding bills to be considered,"" included $39.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $400 million compared with what lawmakers ponied up the previous year. Under the proposal, funding would flow to Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the release said.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021But the appropriation had a catch. Five days later, the House voted mostly along party lines to tie the funding to reversing Obama’s immigration actions, though news accounts said it was unlikely sufficient senators would agree to the linkage and even if that improbably happened, Obama would veto the measure. ""House approval of the spending bill was just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire,"" the Washington Post reported.A Jan. 15, 2015, New York Times news story hinted the issue would be worked out. ""Because Republicans have said that they will use the $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security as their vehicle for dismantling"" Obama’s immigration actions, the story said, ""Congress faces another deadline that seems likely to force an accommodation before the department's money is due to run out at the end of February.""""One disagreement Republicans will have to work out is how far they are willing to go to push legislation that has no chance of becoming law--because it dies either in the Senate or in a presidential veto,"" the Times story said. ""It is clear that some House Republicans want--and expect--the Senate to be as unyielding as they have been, though that is not likely. Asked how far he was willing to go, Rep.

""This is proving to make our neighborhoods safer places for our children and families to grow.""The claim would put DeKalb on pace to reach an ambitious goal May laid out in Fall 2013: Hire 160  police officers and 100 firefighters every year for three years to halt a hemorrhage of public safety workers that hurt the morale of workers and taxpayers.But with the press for new cities in the county, and more calls for existing cities to annex neighborhoods, did DeKalb actually hit its annual goal? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out.Gov. Nathan Deal tapped May to serve as CEO in July 2013, replacing CEO Burrell Ellis, who is suspended while he faces corruption charges.That put May in charge of preparing the 2014 budget, to be amended and approved by the County Commission.May took over just as DeKalb, like many local jurisdictions, was seeing a small rebound from the collapse in the housing market. The county, also like others, had suffered through the revenue losses in part by cutting jobs or keeping positions unfilled, including those in public safety.In September 2013, DeKalb had 915 police officers to fill 1,100 slots. There were 600 firefighters for 789 positions.Worse, the county also lost more officers and firefighters than it could hire through its training academies, which can take up to 26 weeks to complete. In four years, DeKalb hired 277 police officers while 400 left. The fire department’s attrition was even worse: hiring 71 firefighters in four years, while 236 departed.The end of the economic downturn helped boost last year’s budget by $25 million, to $584 million for the general fund. The county set aside $6.6 million and $2.9 of the extra money to hire additional officers and firefighters, budget records show.And both departments held recruit academies for applicants who already passed basic job requirements. For police, the training lasts three weeks for state-certified officers from elsewhere in Georgia, seven weeks for certified officers from other states, and 26 weeks for all candidates with no previous police experience.The dates and number of hires were:97th Police Academy, graduated Feb. 14, 2014 – 29.98th Police Academy, graduated May 30, 2014 – 32.99th Police Academy, graduated July 31, 2014 – 33.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post“Trump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!”By Ciara O'Rourke • February 4, 2021100th Police Academy, graduated Sept. 26, 2014 – 22.101st Police Academy, graduated Jan. 16, 2015 – 35.Total hired: 151.That puts the police department at 94 percent of its annual goal. But the overall numbers actually fell. As of Feb. 1, DeKalb had 859 sworn officers, out of 1,060 authorized sworn positions – tumbling from 83 percent filled to 81 percent filled since May took over.Interim Police Chief James Conroy said that the challenge was ramping up the training after going nearly all of 2013 without any academies – all while losing officers.Momentum is on the county’s side, Conroy added. The current academy, the 102nd, has 26 recruits enrolled for a May graduation.Recruitment and retention efforts in the fire/rescue department were better. The department held two general firefighter academies, graduating in February and September. Training includes the courses required for basic firefighters, which takes 18-20 weeks, and also includes advanced EMT training. For recruits with no previous experience, the academy can take up to 10 ½ months.That means the graduates in 2014 may have started with DeKalb in 2013, hired as recruits.But the county also hired 85 additional recruits in September, and 15 more in October, to hit its annual goal of 100 new firefighters, according to Fire Chief Darnell Fullum. The first group from that academy will graduate in April and be placed in stations.""I know we have met our initiative,"" Fullum said.And, as of Feb. 1, the department had 659 sworn firefighters for 671 spots. That meant the department was 98 percent filled, compared to 76 percent when May started..May said he considers the aggressive hiring effort a success in both departments, noting that 2014 was just the first year of a three-year effort that will be measured as one initiative.County leaders knew not every recruit who entered the academy would graduate and serve, he added, noting DeKalb is getting better at identifying candidates who will be successful.""We still have space, in terms of authorized positions, to get us to our goals,"" May said. ""We are communicating as best we can, to everyone from the public to our employees, that public safety is our top priority and we intend to see results.""That means DeKalb is taking strides towards its overall goal, of hiring 480 police officers and 300 firefighters by the end of 2016.So where does that leave us? May said that the county had held five police academies and three fire/rescue academies in 2014. He is right on the number of academies, but off on what that means.Being spot on with the amount of training underway for DeKalb’s hiring binge in public safety doesn’t translate into the goals of that training being fully met.We rate May’s statement Mostly True.","/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/blog-posting/no-there-wasnt-attempted-assassination-against-tru/",,"Georgia,County Budget,Public Safety,Lee May",,,,,

Jack Keane said.On Fox News Sunday Feb. 1, host Chris Wallace asked Keane if the administration has a strategy to combat Islamic extremism.Keane said, ""We do not. Al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years. ISIS, which began when we pulled out politically and military from Iraq, grew from an organization less than 3,000 to an organization over 30,000 in three years. Radical Islamists spread from Western Africa through the Middle East, all the way to South Asia to sub-Indian continent.""Keane first mentioned the fact that al-Qaida has quadrupled since 2010 in testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee last week. We wondered if it was accurate.The short answer is maybe, depending on your definition. Experts cautioned that it’s nearly impossible to know how large al-Qaida is in terms of membership. And Keane’s figure is just an estimate extrapolated from an earlier analysis. It also relies on a broad definition of ""al-Qaida.""Defining al-QaidaSo who is Keane talking about when he says ""al-Qaida""?Back in the early 2000s, and before 9/11, al-Qaida was generally understood to mean the several hundred people who swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, said Larry Johnson, a consultant specializing in counterterrorism and a former CIA employee.Now when people think of al-Qaida, they usually think of a much broader category consisting of that core group, plus affiliates and other Sunni Islamic extremists, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, located throughout the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent.Under this broad definition, Johnson said Keane’s claim that al-Qaida has grown fourfold since 2010 -- while impossible to verify -- is probably accurate.""Fourfold is probably an underestimate,"" added Frederick Kagan, director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats project.But not everyone agrees to such a broad discussion.Anne Stenersen, a research fellow in terrorism at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the narrowly defined al-Qaida -- that is, its core members -- has stayed relatively stable at fewer than 300 members since 2010. She prefers this definition because the affiliates have varying strategies and objectives.For example, al-Qaida actually split from the Islamic State due to ideological differences.Johnson also noted that some regional groups that have al-Qaida in their names -- like al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb or al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- were given those names by the West, so they do not necessarily reflect how close those groups are to the core al-Qaida group.The evidenceAt the Senate hearing, Keane shared this map that shows various al-Qaida affiliates and other Islamic extremist groups throughout the region as of January:Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Keane told us his advisers came up with the fact that al-Qaida has increased fourfold by relying on a  2014 report from the think tank RAND. The RAND report found that between 2010 and 2013, the number of Islamic jihadist fighters doubled, and the number of attacks tripled.Given the continued rise in activity since 2013 and based on discussions with experts, Keane and his advisers concluded that the size of al-Qaida and its affiliates has essentially doubled again since the RAND report was published. The RAND report relied on both unclassified and classified primary sources to come up with its counts.The trouble trying to countHowever, every expert we spoke with -- as well as government spokespeople -- said it’s not feasible to quantify the size of al-Qaida and its global affiliates. Other than this RAND report, there’s no official count of the number of Islamic extremists that we can use to see how the group’s manpower has grown since 2010.""All that said, al-Qaida is almost certainly bigger than it was five years ago. It's the fourfold that I would question,"" said J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""For each of these groups, we can only estimate their size, and all estimates are disputed.""Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said several al-Qaida groups are much larger than they were five years ago because of the 2011 Arab Spring. The revolutions left many countries without stable leadership and institutions, making them vulnerable to the rise of extreme religious groups.This is what’s happening in Libya with the rise of al-Qaida affiliates, in Syria with the al Nusra front and Yemen with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.Kagan added that in the past five years, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in West Africa, as well as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which doesn’t have official ties to al-Qaida, have grown tremendously.And the United States invasion and later removal from Iraq destabilized the country, Johnson said, giving way to the rise of the Islamic State.""Al-Qaida and its affiliates have expanded enormously over the last five years,"" Kagan said. ""They have transformed from being terrorists to insurgent organizations and in some cases insurgent armies.""Kagan and Johnson both cited the United States’ limited response to the Arab Spring as well as its policies in dealing with Iraq and Iran as contributing to the rise in Islamic extremism throughout North Africa and the Middle East.Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies, said his research has shown that the number of al-Qaida affiliates has more than doubled from eight to 17 since 2008. Adding the Islamic State, once an affiliate, to that count would dramatically increase the number of fighters.""I can’t pin an exact number to Gen. Keane’s assertion — but it doesn’t sound wildly off base to me,"" Hoffman said.Our rulingKeane said, ""al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years.""There’s two tricky parts to Keane’s particular claim. The first is defining al-Qaida. While the group that previously followed Osama bin Laden has remained at about the same size, there is no doubt among experts that we’ve seen a rise in the number of jihadist fighters overall.

They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia.But in a mass email to former students, the school’s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said.PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers.We looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state’s colleges and universities, based on enrollment.The University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students.But a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU’s rolls.That would put GSU’s enrollment well above UGA’s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth..Now, what about that national claim?We found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News & World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State’s claim is based on total enrollment.The website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively.We discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed.Bragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted?

It calls itself the nation’s largest single accredited statewide community college.We looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona State University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star College hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of Minnesota reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County College (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628.Richard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation’s largest universities, once the merger is complete.He said it was  ""a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year"" university.""Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don’t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they’re going to add Georgia Perimeter students,"" he said.""It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can’t see any reputation gains from it,"" he said.Vedder also cautioned that ""getting big doesn’t necessarily mean getting better.""Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State’s size.He has said the merger will play to GSU’s strength as ""a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates.""""Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College’s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success,"" Huckaby said after the merger was approved.GSU officials also have stressed that the university’s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter’s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State’s bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions.Students and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools’ two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career. Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances.Revelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college’s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded.Our conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state’s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation.We rate the alumni association’s statement True.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,https://asunews.asu.edu/20140821-asu-fall-enrollment,https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2014/09/25/10-universities-with-the-largest-undergraduate-student-populations,http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1149/current/show_all,http://www.tccd.edu/about_tcc/quick_facts.html",,"Georgia,Education,GSU Alumni  Association",,,,,

""Well, the truth is, the polls are not dramatically changing.""Appling was a key figure in the 2006 passage of a statewide referendum that effectively banned same-sex marriage in Wisconsin until a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb in June 2014. Appling leads Wisconsin Family Council and Wisconsin Family Action, which describe themselves as advocating for Judeo-Christian values.In that 2006 referendum, 59 percent of voters in the fall general election endorsed rewriting the state constitution in a way that legally recognizes marriage only as ""between one man and one woman.""The referendum language also prohibited the state from recognizing ""a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals.""The U.S. Supreme Court in October 2014 rejected appeals from Wisconsin and four other states seeking to preserve their same-sex marriage bans.Nationally, it’s well documented that attitudes toward gay marriage have become more much more accepting in recent years. Thirty-six states have legalized gay marriage.But what about in Wisconsin?Asked to provide backup for her claim of no dramatic change, Appling pointed in part to two polls from 2014. Neither, however, broke out any Wisconsin data.One surveyed only Republicans or GOP-leaning independents and found large majorities favoring a traditional definition of marriage. The other was from surveys of people as they exited polling places across the country; it showed voters evenly split on gay marriage nationally.But Appling cited public opinion in Wisconsin, not nationwide.She did point us to a Wisconsin statewide poll conducted by St. Norbert College in 2014 -- but it doesn’t entirely back her point. It found a slim majority (52 percent) in favor of the 2006 amendment’s language regarding marriage for ""one man"" and ""one woman."" Remember, it passed with 59 percent support, so that’s a substantial drop.When we looked ourselves, we found a fairly small number of Wisconsin polls that were on point, but they document relatively large changes in opinion.The St. Norbert ""Wisconsin Survey"" sampled opinion on the ""one man-one woman"" language even before the referendum went to voters, and has continued to do so.From that poll, here are the percentages in favor of the ""one man-one woman"" approach advocated 2006 referendum.Spring 2004: 66 percentSpring 2006: 61 percentSpring 2012: 56 percentSpring 2014: 52 percent.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021So, while a bare majority in this survey still backed the traditional view, support for it has fallen 14 percentage points in a decade.Other pollsThe Marquette University Law School Poll tested the issue three times in 2014, and its findings were at odds with the St. Norbert poll.That poll found between 55 percent and 64 percent support for ""allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."" The portion against legal marriage for such couples ranged in size from 30 percent to 37 percent.That suggests an even bigger change in opinion and suggests a reversal from the 2006 referendum vote. Such comparisons are imperfect, though, due to factors such as the unpredictability of who shows up to vote and the impact of the wording of survey questions.The MU Law Poll was launched just three years ago, so it does not have a long history on this question.But we found a couple other sources.In an August 2011 poll,  Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found exactly half of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be illegal, with 39 percent saying legal.By spring 2014, the firm for the first time found more in favor of legalizing than against: 47 to 45 percent, though the two-point gap is smaller than the poll’s margin of error.Exit polls provide more evidence. Surveys taken in November 2014 as voters left polling places asked if Wisconsin should legally recognize same-sex marriage.Yes, said 52 percent. No, said 45 percent.One more finding before we close.Pollsters sometimes throw in other options when asking about how to handle the marriage question. They will ask respondents what is closer to their own view: legalizing same-sex marriage, giving civil recognition to such unions, or giving no legal recognition to them.These results also show major changes in opinion, though support for same-sex marriage comes in lower.In 2009, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank, found 27 percent support for same-sex marriage, 32 percent for civil unions but not same-sex marriage, and 35 percent for no legal recognition.In May 2014, five years later, the Marquette poll posed the same question using the exact same language. It found 49 percent support for same-sex marriage, 25 percent for civil unions and 19 percent for no recognition.That’s a change of 22 points for same-sex marriage.Our ratingIn saying a do-over of the state’s 2006 referendum legalizing only opposite-sex marriages would again pass, Appling said public opinion polls on gay marriage ""are not dramatically changing.""Her remarks were squarely in a Wisconsin context, and surveys here have shown major change in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages.We rate her claim False.","http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-poll-gay-marriage-105886.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2014/US/house/exitpoll,http://www.wpr.org/poll-most-wisconsinites-support-marriage-amendment-also-back-granting-civil-rights,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/,https://law.marquette.edu/poll/results-data/,http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_WI_0826.pdf,http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/,http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2014/PPP_Release_WI_424.pdf,http://www.wpri.org/WPRI-Files/Polls/October-2009/WPRISeptemberSurveyToplines.pdf",,"LGBTQ,Marriage,Wisconsin,Julaine Appling",,,,,

Environmentalists vow to fight the plan.County Commissioner Dennis Moss, who has advocated for an amusement park in his district, told the Miami Herald that the land had been planned for redevelopment for years. And he says the county shouldn’t miss another opportunity to have an amusement park.""When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike, and they took a hike to Central Florida. You see the economic impact they had on Central Florida. We have a chance to do that with 20th Century Fox in our community,"" he said in a Dec. 19 article.His claim set off a flurry of letters to the editor by readers who debated whether Disney World  considered Miami-Dade as a site and if local officials rejected it. Here’s one from prominent South Florida attorney Ben Kuehne:""I wonder who were the unidentified officials in then-Dade County who told Disney to ‘take a hike,’ when Disney does not seem to have ever expressed an interest in South Florida as a potential location for its Disney World attraction. To the contrary, official Disney history is that Disney particularly chose Central Florida in order to not compete with existing tourism areas on the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. Is Moss trying to pull a fast one on the Miami-Dade residents in his haste to pursue a massive theme park development in his district, contending that we lost a nonexistent opportunity once and cannot afford to do so 50 years later?""But then Larry Capp, former executive director of the governmental entity Metro-Miami Action Plan during the 1980s, wrote a letter saying that Moss is correct. Capp’s information is based on conversations he had with the late County Mayor Stephen R. Clark in the 1980s.Clark ""never deviated from his account that Disney wanted to come to Miami,"" Capp wrote. But the negotiations with the county commission fell apart when Disney demanded that the county pay for infrastructure, Capp wrote. He added that Disney had already acquired large parcels in the county in the area that is now Trump National Doral. (Clark, who has since died, was first elected to the Miami city commission in 1963 and later became county mayor.)Time to pull out PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter: Did Disney consider Miami-Dade and did county officials tell Disney to go take a hike? Take a wild ride with us as we try to separate the lore from the truth about the twists and turns in the development of Disney World.Moss uncertain of his sourceMoss, who was first elected in 1993, told PolitiFact Florida that he couldn’t recall any specific source for his claim.""I don’t have anything in writing,"" he said.But Moss pointed to Capp’s letter as ""witness testimony."" While it is certainly possible that during the 1980s Clark told Capp this information about Disney from decades ago, that’s not indisputable evidence in our book. County officials were unable to pinpoint any specific evidence to support Moss’ claim.Moss acknowledged it could be difficult to prove exactly what happened.""Disney is about fairy tales and storybook endings, so who knows what transpired back in the 1950s?""Historians on the alleged Miami-Dade optionAt PolitiFact we prefer history books to story books, so we interviewed several authors and historians who extensively researched the development of Disney World. None of them found evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade.Disney hired leisure-time economics analyst Harrison ""Buzz"" Price to research Disney World locations. Price looked at several states and locations in Florida, but the closest one to Miami-Dade was in Palm Beach County, which Disney ultimately rejected.Price wrote in his book ""Walt’s Revolution by the Numbers"" about how Disney ultimately chose Orlando.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021""In 1961, after rejecting some other alternatives, Walt asked us to look at the rest of Florida and figure out where the park should be. Late in 1963, we studied in depth a location in Central Florida. The key conclusion was that central Florida (not Miami as most people expected it would be) was the main point of maximum intersection of Florida tourism, and that Orlando, centrally located, what's the point of maximum access to the southerly flow of Florida tourism from both the east and west shores of the state…"" (Price has since died.)Disney announced the Orlando project in 1965, and the park opened in 1971.There were, however, Miami connections. When Disney acquired land in the Orlando area, Disney set up dummy corporations in Miami to hide that it was acquiring the property, said Disney Family Museum historian Paula Sigman Lowery. Disney was secretive about his plans as he was buying land because he didn’t want prices to skyrocket. Disney used Miami lawyer Paul Helliwell, who as a CIA agent had relocated to Miami in 1960 to carry out actions against Castro. Helliwell came up with the approach to create essentially fake cities for Disney World, wrote author T.D. Allman in Finding Florida.Five authors of books about Disney -- Rollins College professor Richard Foglesong, T.D. Allman, Sam Gennawey, Jim Korkis and Chad Emerson -- all told PolitiFact Florida that during their research they found no evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade.""I say this from having extensively researched the Disney land-purchase story, based on research at the Disney archives in Burbank and a close reading of legal documents involving depositions of key Disney players as reported in a book published by Yale University Press and fact-checked to the smallest detail,"" Foglesong told PolitiFact Florida in an email.Foglesong added, ""I can’t say that it’s not true, I can only say I did not find evidence to that claim.""Experts told us that Disney did not want to build near the beach which would compete with his amusement park.But Korkis said that there are gaps in historical records which are based in part on oral history.""The Disney Archives was not created until 1970, and it stumbled for a decade trying to locate and organize papers, and even today there are huge gaps. When it comes to Disney history, there are things that the Imagineers refer to as ‘logical erroneous conclusions,’ things that sound reasonable but are completely wrong,"" he said. ""Often, people sincerely believe something is true.""Miami Herald researcher Monika Leal looked through two boxes of news clips from the newspaper in the 1960s about Disney World and found no reference to Disney considering Miami-Dade County.But wait a second .... There was a time when Miami politicians talked to Disney executives about building some type of attraction in the county, but it wasn’t Disney World, says Maurice Ferre, who was mayor of Miami from 1973 to 1985The Miami Herald wrote multiple articles about Ferre’s push to bring an amusement park to Watson Island. Disney executives toured the Watson Island site in 1984, but in 1985, the Miami Herald reported that Disney rejected the idea.""What I wanted was to develop on Watson Island a mini-Disney park,"" Ferre told PolitiFact Florida.We asked Moss and Capp if the lore about Disney and Miami-Dade could be related to Watson Island in the 1980s, rather than the actual Disney World project in the 1960s.Moss said he wasn’t aware of the Watson Island project, however ,""What I heard was in reference to Disney World.""""Gosh I really don’t know,"" Capp said. Mayor Clark ""never mentioned Watson Island or anything downtown or the waterfront. He strictly said the Doral area. .... This is becoming quite a mystery.""Our rulingMoss said, ""When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike.""At PolitiFact we believe that politicians need to back up their claims, and in this case Moss said he doesn’t have a documented source. The account by Capp that former Mayor Clark told him in the 1980s that this happened decades before doesn’t provide first-hand evidence. And it’s the only piece of evidence we found in favor of Moss’s point.The historians we interviewed said they had never seen evidence to support the claim that Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World.If we later find evidence that shows Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World, we will revisit this fact-check, but so far Moss has failed to prove his claim, so we rate it False.","http://www.miamidade.gov/economicadvocacytrust/history.asp,http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/travel/county-wasnt-big-enough-for-both-walt-disney-joh-1/nLzpQ/,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://wdwnews.com/releases/2011/07/19/walt-disney-world-resort-world-history-digest/,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/14/how-the-cia-helped-disney-conquer-florida.html,https://www.amazon.com/Married-Mouse-Disney-World-Orlando/dp/0300098286,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/14/how-the-cia-helped-disney-conquer-florida.html,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114522-the-disneyland-story,https://www.amazon.com/The-Revised-Vault-Walt-Unauthorized-ebook/dp/B00AJA95DE,http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-14/business/os-cfb-talking-with-emerson-031510-20100314_1_disney-cast-members-paul-helliwell-underground,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/maurice-ferre/",,"County Government,History,Recreation,Florida,Dennis Moss",,,,,

More than 750 people have been detained in total over the past 13 years, with 132 current detainees. About 2,100 people work there. So how much does it cost?For fiscal year 2014, the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is $397 million, according to a Department of Defense report drafted for the Senate Intelligence Committee. This includes money spent on maintenance, personnel, contracted work, military commissions and Department of Defense-funded studies.Spread out among the 155 people detained over the course of 2014, that’s about $2.6 million per detainee.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021In 2013, with a similar-size budget but more detainees, the cost worked out to about $2.7 million per detainee.For comparison, inmates at high-security federal prisons cost about $34,000 per year on average, as of 2012.Part of the reason holding detainees at Guantanamo is so much more expensive than other prisons might be transportation costs, said Madeline Morris, a law professor and director of Duke University’s Guantanamo Defense Clinic. Most people, food and supplies have to be brought in by air, which is an enormous cost.The number of detainees is going down, but the facility may face extra costs in the future. In August 2014, the New York Times reported that an estimated $200 million in maintenance will be necessary in coming years to keep the detention facility functioning. The infrastructure was originally built to be temporary.One aspect of Guantanamo that doesn’t cost very much is the land. In 1903, then-President Theodore Roosevelt secured the area from Cuba for $2,000 a year, paid in gold -- worth about $4,085 today.

Bogus, a Fox Business host claimed recently.In a discussion about waning personal freedom in the free world, pundit John Stossel went off about the onslaught of government rules and regulations telling Americans what they can do and when, where and how they can do it.He used cigarette-smoking as an example, arguing that business owners should have the right to allow smoking in their bars or restaurants even where ordinances or laws ban the practice.""Yeah, they kill smokers,"" Stossel said on Fox & Friends of cigarettes. ""But there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people.""A Fox spokeswoman did not return our inquiry, and Stossel, who has long questioned the lethal nature of secondhand smoke, did not reply to emails and tweets.

But the smokers still take it."")Stossel’s definition of ""good"" might be different than ours, but there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people.Secondhand smoke is a mixture of smoke emitted from the burning end of a cigarette or other tobacco products and what’s exhaled by smokers. It’s regarded as a cancer-causing agent, a ""known human carcinogen"" (a healthful classification, that is not).The government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces as a way to protect Americans from secondhand smoke, saying there is no safe level of exposure. Reports from the country’s top doctors say these laws are reducing risk.The U.S. surgeon general has released 31 reports about the effects of smoking since 1964. These reports are extremely detailed, summarizing the latest research on smoking and peer-reviewed by dozens of the nation’s top scientists.Consensus on secondhand smoke really began to form in the 1980s, even as the tobacco industry’s""doubt-creation machine"" spun opposing talking points, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, senior scientific editor of the 2014 surgeon general report and director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health.The surgeon general’s 2006 report stated rather bluntly that inhaling secondhand smoke ""causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults."" Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke killed more than 49,000 nonsmokers in 2005, plus 430 newborns who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the report said.In 2014, the acting surgeon general released a new report, one that factored in input from more than 80 contributing authors and 150 reviewers who are experts in medicine and public health. Secondhand smoke can also increase risk of stroke, the new report found. Beyond that, involuntary exposure poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions.Since 1964, the report said, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke.How does the government calculate its numbers?Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Scientists don’t keep a count of deaths by secondhand smoke as recorded in death certificates. (Death certificates don’t list ""secondhand smoke"" as a cause of death.) Instead, they rely on statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who are experts in disease patterns within populations. To figure out lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke, for instance, the individual risk of lung cancer is analyzed next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke.It’s a complicated statistical analysis (page 659 explains more), one with which Stossel obviously finds fault. But it’s not unusual. The same method is used to attribute the number of deaths from obesity through diabetes, for example, Samet said.""This is the basic way to use to understand how the disease is exposed to this risk,"" Samet said. ""We understand that there are uncertainties that go with this, but this is a very basic tool. ... The approach here is embedded in science and policy and understanding how much a disease is caused by something.""The surgeon general is not alone in major scientific organizations linking secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. There’s also the World Health Organization’s International Center for Research on Cancer, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences.""At this point, the evidence is firm and very powerful, and important conclusions have been reached,"" Samet said.You can quibble over specific numbers since they’re approximations, said Gary Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. But not that secondhand smoke kills, he said.""Chronic exposure produces disease and death,"" Giovino said.How do folks such as Stossel respond?The libertarian Cato Institute published a response to the 2006 surgeon general’s report on secondhand smoke that highlighted testimony before a committee of the British Parliament by Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto. Peto, who has studied the causes of cancer and the effects of smoking, testified that he could not quantify deaths from secondhand smoke because ""these hazards cannot be directly measured."" (The story was written by Gio Gori, an epidemiologist who wrote publications on behalf of the industry-backed Tobacco Institute refuting studies about nicotine’s harmful effects.)Conversely, some scientists say the government is actually undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths.""The criticism … is not that they overestimate the risk, it’s that they’re underestimating it,""  said Stanton Glantz, a University of California San Francisco medicine professor and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.And dog lovers, beware: New evidence shows secondhand smoke can also kill pets, including lung and nasal cancer in dogs and malignant lymphoma in cats.Our rulingStossel said ""there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people.""His definition of good obviously differs with the vast majority of scientists and researchers studying the effects of secondhand smoke. They say the data does show that secondhand smoke kills people. And that the data is indeed solid.Stossel’s claim rates False.","http://mediamatters.org/video/2011/05/24/stossel-downplays-dangers-of-second-hand-smoke/179982,https://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=1955237,http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/ETS,https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/secondhandsmoke/fullreport.pdf,https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/exec-summary.pdf,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/sgr50-chap-12.pdf,http://www.who.int/tobacco/research/secondhand_smoke/about/en/,http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2009/Secondhand-Smoke-Exposure-and-Cardiovascular-Effects-Making-Sense-of-the-Evidence/Secondhand%20Smoke%20%20Report%20Brief%203.pdf,http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2007/3/v30n1-5.pdf,http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/secondhand-smoke-can-also-cause-cancer-in-pets-studies-show/2187828",,"Public Health,Science,PunditFact,John Stossel",,,,,

The concern is that if these people can now work in the country legally, it will take opportunities away from the people who were born here.In a newspaper op-ed, Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, faulted loose immigration policies for what he called the economy’s ""lackluster performance."" Morici cited a number of factors, including this striking statement about immigrants.""(They) have captured all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000,"" Morici wrote. ""Illegal immigrants hold many of these positions, and now the president threatens to legalize their status by executive action if the Republican Congress won't cave to his demands.""A reader wondered if Morici was right about immigrants scoring all of the new jobs. Morici’s statement that ""illegal immigrants hold many of these positions"" is a bit vague, so this fact-check focuses only on his claim about immigrants, both legal and illegal, capturing ""all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000.""Morici told PunditFact he got his numbers from a recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration.""The total number of working-age (16 to 65) immigrants (legal and illegal) holding a job increased 5.7 million from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014, while declining 127,000 for natives,"" the report said.While the report didn’t spell out how many jobs the economy gained since 2000, it provided a link to a table that showed a growth of about 5.5 million jobs. These numbers largely match data provided by the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.So it might look as though Morici is on firm ground. The center’s study found that the number of jobs gained by the foreign-born was pretty much the same as the number of new jobs added to the economy.But there are a few hitches.First, that study focused on workers between 16 and 65 years old. In a footnote, the authors acknowledge that the results would look quite different if they had included older workers.Using the study’s table, we did that and saw that while foreign-born workers did better than those born in the United States, they didn’t account for all of the gains. For workers 16 years old and up, the total change in employment was about 8.8 million. Of that, the number of foreign-born workers grew about 6.2 million and for native-born, the number was 2.6 million. As this chart shows, the percentages change a lot.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021If you parse Morici’s statement, you can see where these numbers get him into trouble. If he wants to speak of nearly 9 million new jobs, then he has to accept that about 70 percent, not 100 percent, went to immigrants. If he wants to assert that all the new jobs went to immigrants, then he should have talked about 5.5 million new jobs in the 16-65 age range. As it stands, the two parts of his statement don’t fit together.The center’s study also noted that the time period you pick will change what the data show. The report said, ""Since the jobs recovery began in 2010, 43 percent of employment growth has gone to immigrants."" That, obviously, is much less than ""all"" of the new jobs.It is worth noting that the study lumped legal and illegal immigrants together. Morici made a passing reference to illegal immigrants taking ""many"" of the new jobs. That claim is difficult to verify one way or the other because within the group of foreign-born workers, the ratio of American citizens to noncitizens has changed greatly in the past 15 years. In 2000, noncitizens outnumbered citizens by about 60 percent. In 2014, the difference was just 10 percent.Furthermore, it would be a mistake to treat all of the noncitizen workers as illegal immigrants. All these data show is that they were not born in this country and have not become citizens. They could have proper work permits, so their legal status is unknown.We told Morici about the issues we found in the data and didn’t hear back.Pia Orrenius is vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Orrenius said that foreign-born workers have found work faster than people born in America for many reasons. The demand for certain jobs has changed greatly, most likely thanks to new technology, she said.""Labor markets are polarizing and middle-skill jobs are disappearing,"" Orrenius said. ""Natives tend to be middle-skilled compared to immigrants who are concentrated mostly on the low-skill end but also on the high-skill end.""Orrenius also said that native-born workers face different choices than newcomers when looking for work. They might be able to take advantage of government programs (such as Social Security disability), or they might have more savings that allow them to get by without a job longer than an immigrant. Also, immigrants tend to move to parts of the country where growth is faster, while native-born workers tend to stay put.Our rulingMorici said that all of the nearly 9 million new jobs created since 2000 went to immigrants.His numbers don’t add up. The study he cited linked to numbers that showed that immigrants accounted for about 70 percent of the net job growth. While that study’s headline was that all of the new jobs went to immigrants, that only held true for a certain age range, which Morici misapplied to all workers.Morici is correct that foreign-born workers, both citizens and noncitizens, do disproportionately well in the job market. But the actual numbers fall well short of the 100 percent that he said. ""All"" is an overstatement.There is an element of truth in the claim, but it ignores certain critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/opinion/2014/11/07/economist-lackluster-jobs-growth-continues/18674833/,http://www.cis.org/all-employment-growth-since-2000-went-to-immigrants,http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/camarota-employment-t1.jpg,http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/camarota-employment-t1.jpg,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Immigration,Economy,Jobs,PunditFact,Peter Morici",,,,,

But the issue isn’t going anywhere. When the new Republican-led Senate takes over in January, it will likely be at the top of their priorities list.Obama and other Keystone critics have argued that the pipeline would have a negative environmental impact, while having little benefit for the United States. For example, constructing the pipeline would result in few permanent American jobs.""Understand what this project is,"" Obama said at a Nov. 14 press conference in Burma. ""It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices.""Two days later, in Brisbane, Australia, Obama described Keystone XL as ""a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world markets, not to the United States.""Predicting the effect of the pipeline on gas prices is a little tricky. Experts tend to agree that it could impact gas prices, but the effect would be indirect and minimal. But in this fact check, we’re going to focus on the export question -- whether or not, as Obama said, Keystone XL’s primary destination is beyond the United States.We found that Obama’s off the mark.Crude oilIn recent years, the United States has become a net-exporter of refined oil products, like gasoline, jet fuel and asphalt (meaning it exports more products than it imports), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, it is a net-importer of the crude oil it uses to make those products.Keystone XL would transport crude oil from Canada’s tar sands through the Midwestern United States down to the Gulf Coast, and there are refineries all along the proposed route. (The map is from TransCanada, the pipeline operator.)America gets more crude oil from Canada than any other country. Nearly all of Canada’s exports go to the United States, and this accounts for about a third of America’s total crude oil imports. Much of its oil already makes it to the United States by rail and existing pipelines.We asked several energy economics experts, and they believe that quite a bit -- if not most -- of the Keystone XL crude oil will be bought and used by American refineries.""It’s difficult to say with any certainty, but it is most likely that most would be refined in the U.S.,"" said Kenneth Medlock, an expert in energy economics at Rice University in Texas.A recent State Department report argues that it would not be ""economically justified"" for Canada to primarily export its Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United States, when there are plenty of American refineries to consume it.Some independent refineries -- particularly those in the upper Midwest, but also in Texas -- are in desperate need of crude oil, said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow in energy security at the Brookings Institution. Currently, the refineries have to import crude from places like Venezuela and Mexico -- though it would be cheaper and better for overall energy security to buy from a North American source, rather than pay high transport costs.Featured Fact-checkStudents for Trumpstated on February 16, 2021 in a Tweet“Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 23, 2021On Nov. 17, TransCanada told Reuters, it ""makes no business sense for our customers to transport oil down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, pay to export it overseas but then pay to transport millions of barrels of higher-priced oil back to the U.S. refineries to create the products we rely on.""Ebinger added that many American refineries are geared to use heavy crude, which is what Keystone would transport from Canada’s tar sands.There would, though, likely be oil coming through the Keystone XL pipeline in excess of what the American refineries would be able to use, noted Eric Smith, an energy economist at Tulane University. This excess oil could go to other countries capable of refining it. Still, most Keystone oil would stay in North America.Refined productsSome Keystone XL critics have focused on the fact that American refineries could export some of the products they make with the Canadian crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel fuel or asphalt. They argue that because products made in the United States, using Keystone XL oil, will leave the country, the pipeline wouldn’t improve domestic energy security or independence.Anti-Keystone XL environmental group Tar Sands Action (part of the larger 350.org) said in a Keystone XL fact sheet, that American refineries will process the oil but, ""much of the fuel refined from the pipeline’s heavy crude oil will never reach U.S. drivers’ tanks.""However, American oil refineries’ product exports are ""not sensitive"" to the addition of a new pipeline, the State Department study says. Export trends are more dependent on demand -- both domestically and abroad -- as well as the cost of natural gas and foreign refining capacity. American oil refineries are already increasing their exports, and that trend could continue independent of Keystone XL.""Refined product export levels have already increased and some of the crude used is from foreign sources,"" the report says. ""As this may already be occurring, it may continue with or without (Keystone XL).""Further, the report says, ""The economic viability of exports does increase the demand for crudes in the United States,"" but, ""this demand does not depend on the proposed project.""Even if exports are increasing, the majority of oil products refined in the United States stay in the United States. For example, in 2013, Gulf Coast area refineries produced about 946,000 barrels of finished motor gasoline per day. They exported about one-third of that -- 323,000 barrels per day.In January, Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked at an ad by liberal PAC NextGen Climate that said, ""(China is) counting on the U.S. to approve TransCanada’s pipeline to ship oil through America’s heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs."" A spokesman for NextGen told Fact Checker that they were referring to refined product exports, rather than crude oil. Fact Checker gave the ad its lowest rating of Four Pinocchios.Even if Keystone XL isn’t built, experts said Canada will find other ways to transport their oil to the United States. Canada already sends crude from the oil sands into the United States by rail and other pipelines.""I have no doubt that Canada will develop alternate means of monetizing its crude oil, whether that be via expanded rail shipments or by building pipelines to one or both of its coasts,"" Smith said.The longer that politicians debate Keystone XL, the more time Canada has to figure out these alternate means.""Keystone XL is rapidly becoming irrelevant,"" said Michelle Foss, energy economist at the University of Texas’ Bureau of Economic Geology.Our rulingObama said, Keystone XL allows ""Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else.""The general consensus among experts, as well as the State Department, is that American refineries would be the primary buyers of crude oil transported through the Keystone XL pipeline, by a vast margin. Some Keystone XL critics have a point that American refineries would likely export some of the products that they make with crude oil transported by the pipeline. The State Department says, however, that product exports are already increasing, and that trend would likely continue independent of a new pipeline. Additionally, American refineries tend to keep more products in the country than they export.We rate Obama’s claim Mostly False.","https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/16/russ-girling/transcanada-ceo-says-42000-keystone-xl-pipeline-jo/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/14/remarks-president-obama-and-daw-aung-san-suu-kyi-burma-joint-press-confe,https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_neti_dc_NUS-Z00_mbblpd_a.htm,http://keystone-xl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Keystone-overview-booklet-us.pdf,https://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=CA,http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221147.pdf,/personalities/students-trump/,/factchecks/2021/feb/23/students-trump/no-biden-executive-order-did-not-allow-china-acces/,https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/usa-keystone-exports-idUSL2N0T716A20141117,http://blog.nwf.org/2013/03/keystone-xl-exports-not-energy-security/,http://tarsandsaction.org/keystone-xl-facts/,https://350.org/,http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221147.pdf,https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_refp2_dc_r30_mbblpd_a.htm,https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_exp_dc_R30-Z00_mbblpd_a.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/31/an-over-the-top-ad-attacking-the-keystone-xl-pipeline/,https://online.wsj.com/articles/crude-oil-shipments-by-rail-loom-large-in-canadian-pacifics-future-1412711981",,"National,Energy,Gas Prices,Barack Obama",,,,,

That story said that more than $800,000 in renovations had occurred at the governor’s Greek Revival mansion at 700 N. Adams St.Those renovations included cleaning oriental rugs, refinishing wood floors, ""new wallpaper, pillows, furniture, drapes, paint, window repairs, new screens for the swimming pool and an upgraded kitchen,"" the story read.According to the story, the state spent almost $3 million on the property during Gov. Jeb Bush’s eight years in office, although a third of that money was for security upgrades after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.The story said that during Crist’s four-year term from 2007-2011, the state spent a bit more than $27,000. The AP later corrected this amount to almost $443,000.Of the $800,000 the AP said was spent during Scott’s term, almost $600,000 was taxpayer money that went to grounds upkeep, the story said. More than $200,000 more was donated to the Governor’s Mansion Foundation by U.S. Sugar, Florida Crystals and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. There were also $20,000 in gifts from lobbyist Brian Ballard, Scott adviser Tony Fabrizio and the CEO of a private prison company, George Zoley.That private money was used to pay for things like $38,000 in new rugs and $2,000 for a new mirror for First Lady Ann Scott, who had been an interior designer, the AP story said.For this fact-check, we won’t look at private donations, because Crist said ""your tax dollars.""The Scott campaign said the mansion has routinely been funded by both public and private money, and that the public money involved was used according to state law. It paid for things like code compliance in the kitchen, repairing safety hazards in public areas, electrical upgrades and plumbing repairs, spokesman Greg Blair said.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021We checked in with the Department of Management Services, the agency that handles expenses for upkeep. Spokesman Ben Wolf told us that the DMS has a budget for mansion projects, and periodic fixes are needed. He declined to be more specific for us.He did give us totals for renovations, maintenance and purchases made for the mansion’s improvements using public money, but we found some numbers were a bit different than what the AP reported in 2013.From January 1999 to December 2006, Jeb Bush’s terms in office, the total was $2.87 million, including post-Sept. 11 security upgrades such as buying surrounding property and putting up barriers.The total from Crist’s term, January 2007 to December 2010, was almost $443,000, including almost $254,000 for heating and cooling ductwork and $102,000 for the design and installation of a ""fuel cell"" designed to cut emissions and power use. Adding in miscellaneous purchases like tools, supplies, building materials, freight and so on, the total went up to almost $628,000.As for Scott, the DMS disclosure said a little more than $499,000 had been spent for the things Blair claimed. Although that measured more than just 2011, that year is when the bulk of the expenses were incurred. (We’ll also note that more than $10,000 in tax money was spent on cabana repairs.) Add in other expenditures, as we did with Crist and Bush, and the grand total from January 2011 to the present is almost $745,000.  In 2013, the Department of Management Services said the agency had reviewed the mansion and decided it needed some freshening, without Scott’s input. Scott’s office said then that neither the governor nor the first lady asked for the changes, but the AP reported that May 2011 meeting minutes from a Governor’s Mansion Committee gathering showed Ann Scott had mentioned the house’s condition.""It’s important to me to maintain its beauty and showcase its history, making the mansion a welcome destination for all guests,"" she said.We also tried contacting mansion curator Carol Beck several times, but never heard back. She was quoted in the AP story as saying Department of Management Services officials ""have been exceptionally proactive in addressing concerns of the first lady and myself as it relates to the current condition of the interior and exterior of the mansion proper, as well as the grounds.""This wasn’t the only time spending on the manse has been an issue.

So the amount of tax money spent on renovations at the mansion is close.However, the ad is trying to make it sound like Scott was being wasteful, and that's not as clear. The Crist and Bush administrations also spent large sums on expensive renovations, and the money doesn't appear to have come from a direct request from Scott (although the Scotts did accept donations to spruce up the mansion).

Rick Scott argued about restoration of civil rights during the Oct. 21 debate on CNN. ""When I was governor, I brought restoration of rights back for nonviolent felons so they can have a chance to get a job,"" Crist said. ""Sadly, under Rick Scott it's gone, and it's gone for at least five years, you can't even apply.""That set off a testy back-and-forth exchange:Scott: ""Here's Charlie's plan. You commit a heinous crime, as soon as you get out of jail, you get to vote. Stalk, you get to vote as soon as you walk out. You have intentional permanent disfigurement of a child, you walk out of jail, you immediately get to vote. That's wrong, Charlie.""Crist: ""That is fundamentally unfair. I said nonviolent criminals. You are lying again.""Scott: ""No, that's not true. Go to FactsforFlorida.com, Charlie. You want to look yourself, you can look it up. That's exactly what you did. And I completely disagree with that.""Crist: ""It's very unfair. Go to his site if you want to, but I would recommend that you go to FairShotFlorida.com instead, and you'll find out the truth. What he just said is absolutely false.""Well, we recommend that if you want facts, go to politifact.com/florida. (We're glad you're here!)Does Crist want violent offenders to immediately regain their right to vote?  In a word, no.Restoration of rights under CristSince 1968, the Cabinet has held the power to restore rights to felons with various governors making changes to make it harder or easier. Those changes did not always fall on party lines: Democrat Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, while Republican Jeb Bush simplified the process, though advocates pushed for additional reforms.In April 2007 under Crist’s direction, Crist and the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. (Crist was a Republican at the time; he is now running as a Democrat to get his old job back.)Crist defended the move in a 2007 op-ed:""Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow 'weak on crime,’ as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true. Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior.""Under the 2007 changes, there were specific rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back. All of them had to first finish the terms of their sentence, including probation and restitution.About 80 percent of felons were potentially eligible to quickly regain their civil rights without hearings, the Tampa Bay Times reported when the new rules were approved. The offenders convicted of more serious crimes, such as murders, had to take additional steps to apply to get their rights restored, including attending a formal hearing.• Level 1: Offenders convicted of less serious felonies such as burglary, DUI or selling drugs had cases reviewed for eligibility and the Clemency Board could sign off on restoring rights without holding a hearing. This was nearly automatic.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021• Level 2: Offenders included those convicted of aggravated battery, felony stalking, or trafficking in cocaine. An investigation was required to determine eligibility, and the board had 30 days to review the results, but the state did not hold a hearing.• Level 3: Offenders included murderers and sexual predators. Those cases required a more thorough investigation, and they had to appear at a hearing.There was another path for offenders -- at any level -- to get their rights restored. If they had completed all the terms of their sentence, including probation and paying restitution, and were crime-free and arrest-free for 15 years, they could apply to have their rights restored.We asked the state how many of the 156,000 restorations that occurred under the Crist rules fell into each category and were not able to obtain that information. Most of the offender records are confidential.Those felons who had their rights restored ""could indeed be described as largely nonviolent,"" said Mark Schlakman, senior program director for The Florida State University Center for the Advancement of Human Rights. (Schlakman is a supporter of restoring felons’ civil rights.)But it’s likely that some committed a violent offense at some point, said a leading researcher of felon disenfranchisement.""I haven’t examined the Florida restorations enough to know if anybody with any violent arrest ever had their civil rights restored, but I suspect that’s the case,"" said University of Minnesota sociologist Christopher Uggen.In 2011, at the urging of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Scott and the Cabinet reversed the policy under Crist and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period for nonviolent felons. During Scott’s tenure through mid September, restorations have been granted to 1,589 people.We asked a spokesman for Crist’s campaign, Kevin Cate, if Crist wants to bring back the three tiers. ""He will work with the Cabinet to bring back a fair and just process for nonviolent, reformed felons to regain their civil rights,"" Cate said.Scott says Crist’s policy included violent offendersScott told the debate audience that felons who committed these ""heinous"" crimes could walk out of jail and immediately get to vote.But no one got their rights restored automatically as they walked out of jail. All offenders had to complete their sentences, including probation and paying restitution, before they were eligible. For even the lowest level of offenders, the state still had to review their cases for eligibility and the Clemency Board had to sign off on them.The state policy under Crist included a list of certain serious violent offenses, such as murder, that excluded felons from going through the faster process to get their rights restored without a formal hearing.But Scott spokesman Greg Blair noted that several violent offenses were not on that list -- leaving open the possibility that violent felons could access the faster process to get their rights restored. That includes battery or abuse of an elderly person, possessing or discharging a firearm on school property, threatening a witness, injuring or killing a police dog, resisting arrest with violence or animal torture.""You can ask a legal expert which of those are technically classified as ‘violent,’ though I can say with some certainty that nursing home abuse and battery on the elderly count. And resisting arrest with violence, that one’s in the name. So yes, violent criminals could receive restoration of rights under Charlie Crist,"" Blair argued.Our rulingScott said that Crist wants felons who commit ""a heinous crime"" such as ""intentional permanent disfigurement of a child"" to walk out of jail and immediately get the right to vote.The Cabinet under Crist made it easier for felons to get their rights restored, but they didn’t regain those rights immediately after leaving jail.The offenders had to complete the terms of their sentence, including probation, to qualify. And then the Clemency Board had to sign off on the restorations. The most serious violent offenders had to undergo an investigation and hearing.The only kernel of truth here is that it is possible that some felons who had committed violent crimes got their rights restored, but it wasn’t immediately upon leaving jail. So we rate this claim Mostly False.","http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/21/transcript-cnn-and-wjxt-tv-host-florida-gubernatorial-debate/,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/dec/12/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-says-charlie-crist-got-approved-automat/,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/894213-rules-of-executive-clemency-2007.html,http://www.sptimes.com/2007/04/04/news_pf/Opinion/Once_penalties_are_pa.shtml,https://www.fcor.state.fl.us/docs/clemency/ClemencyTimeline.pdf,/personalities/greg-kelly/,/factchecks/2021/feb/09/greg-kelly/newsmax-host-falsely-claims-only-one-person-died-c/,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/894213-rules-of-executive-clemency-2007.html",,"Elections,Crime,Florida,Rick Scott",,,,,

What does that mean to people in New Hampshire? It means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare. … She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time.""Brown has delivered variations of this claim so frequently over the past few months that anyone in New Hampshire who’s been plugged into an electronic device has surely heard it. It’s been a mainstay of Brown’s ads in a frenzied air war -- so far in the race for U.S. Senate, more than 10,000 ads have aired costing, more than $7 million.PolitiFact New Hampshire looked into a version of this claim last March, after the New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video titled ""99 Percent."" It claimed that Shaheen consistently supports the president and ""votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."" The ad was launched before Brown had officially declared himself a candidate in the race.Here, we’ll look at Brown’s claim that Shaheen has ""voted with the president 99 percent of the time.""  (Last year PolitiFact New Hampshire checked the claim that Shaheen was the deciding vote for Obamacare and ruled that Mostly False.)Brown’s charge carries some weight. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents (55 percent) now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare"" -- is opposed by 52 percent of the people in the state, according to findings from an Oct. 10, 2014 Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.Democrats across the country have faced similar critiques from Republicans; PolitiFact has frequently checked such claims and found them to have varying degrees of accuracy.Obama himself acknowledged the strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014.""Now, I am not on the ballot this fall,"" Obama said. ""But make no mistake:  These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them.""During the debate, Brown even quoted the president to drive home his point.Of course, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record to see whether Brown was correct.When we checked this claim previously, we asked the NHGOP for evidence. Executive director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report.CQ, a news service that covers Capitol Hill, examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow for comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked out a position.The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, when you look at the pool of votes in which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time.Featured Fact-checkFrank Guintastated on June 13, 2012 in a statement made after he filed for re-election at the N.H. Secretary of State’s office.""Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan."" By Jake Berry • June 22, 2012Still, there’s more to that number than meets the eye.In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes --  about one third.WMUR political reporter James Pindell further analyzed the figures and found that 70 of those votes involved presidential nominations -- to positions that ranged from Secretary of State John Kerry to a variety of federal judgeships. The remaining 38 involved some type of public policy, including seven on immigration, four on gun policy, and five budget bills.The only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 came on a bill involving an Internet sales tax, Pindell reported.We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office, which coincided with Obama’s election to his first term. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year.Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time.That’s pretty close to the 99 percent figure, however, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis.Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah noted that the senator had broken with Obama on some issues that do not come to a vote; these are not reflected in the CQ tally.For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen spoke out against a new round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and she opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits.There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list.Finally, in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a ""Bipartisan Champion"" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation.""It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes,"" Shah said.Our rulingScott Brown said Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time.Brown has credible support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. That wasn’t much different than earlier years in the Senate -- overall, her votes have aligned with Obama’s 98 percent of the time since she took office.Still, the CQ ratings address a fraction of all issues facing Congress. Obama only took a clear position in about one third of the Senate votes, and in some issues that didn’t come to a vote, Shaheen broke with the President.Still, Brown’s claim about Shaheen isn’t far off. We rate it Mostly True.","http://nhpr.org/post/more-10000-television-ads-have-aired-so-far-brown-shaheen-senate-race,https://vimeo.com/89872392,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/us/politics/former-massachusetts-senator-announces-new-hampshire-run.html?_r=0,https://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/19/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-us-senator-jeanne-shaheen-d-nh-w/,http://cola.unh.edu/sites/cola.unh.edu/files/research_publications/gsp2014_fall_presapp101014.pdf,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/02/remarks-president-economy-northwestern-university,/personalities/frank-guinta/,/factchecks/2012/jun/22/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-claims-bipartisan-support-jobs/,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/295431-internet-sales-tax-advances-after-obama-endorsement-,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/pentagon-cuts-obama-budget-89852.html,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/democrats-social-security_n_3224503.html,http://www.opencongress.org/people/votes_with_party/senate/democrat,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/2013/06/bright-idea-energy-policy",,"New Hampshire,Bipartisanship,Scott Brown",,,,,
326,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/oct/16/mary-burke/scott-walkers-tax-plan-favors-rich-corporations-ov/,"Under Scott Walker's ""tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.""",,politifact,,"In a Mary Burke TV ad released Oct. 8, 2014, the narrator begins by asking:""What’s $11 buy you in Wisconsin? How about a pizza?""Sounds good. We're hungry.Then the ad quickly turns to one of Burke's key campaign themes -- that Gov. Scott Walker favors big business and the well-to-do over average folk.Under Walker's ""tax plan,"" the narrator continues, ""the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.""The ad ends with ""Scott Walker -- Millions for them, pizza for you.""Doesn't sound quite as tasty any more.Burke’s reference to a ""tax plan"" suggests Walker has had only one, when there have been several measures affecting income and property taxes.And, notably, she expresses each dollar amount differently -- a small per-month figure for the average taxpayer, versus a large lump sum for corporations and a large per-year figure for millionaires.So let’s slice up Burke's claim into its three pieces and see what we have.Average taxpayer: $11 per monthWhen the narrator speaks about the average taxpayer and Walker’s tax plan, a footnote appears on the screen referencing the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, and a date: July 28, 2014.But the footnote doesn’t give the viewer a clear idea of what Burke is citing -- or that it just provides a partial picture.A memo issued by the bureau on that day details two state income cuts signed into law by Walker in 2013. It says a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 to $50,000 will save an average of $133 in 2014.That comes to about $11 per month.Walker’s campaign, meanwhile, noted that the same memo pegs the average savings -- rather than the savings for the average taxpayer -- slightly higher, at $189 per year.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 15, 2021 in a post on Facebook“If you make $50,000/year, $36 of your taxes goes to food stamps. $4,000 goes to corporate subsidies.”By Madison Czopek • February 19, 2021That would be about $16 per month.The larger point, however, is that besides income tax cuts, Walker has approved a number of property tax relief measures. These are ignored by Burke, who made a broad claim but then supported it only by citing reductions in one type of tax.When Walker claimed that his various income and property tax cuts amount to $322 in the 2014 tax year for the average family, our rating was Mostly True. That comes to about $27 per month.We found that the income and property tax cuts would save the median-income family at least that much in 2014, although not every average family would save that much, particularly if they are not property owners.Corporations: $610 millionBurke overstates the second part of her claim -- that corporations got $610 million in tax cuts.That figure is based on another fiscal bureau memo, which calculates tax savings over Walker’s full four-year term. The memo describes those tax reductions as being ""targeted to businesses,"" not necessarily corporations, which suggests large operations.In other words, some of the tax cuts apply to small businesses as well.For example, $126 million of the $610 million comes from reducing the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Businesses organized like limited liability companies -- whose shareholders pay the firm's tax as personal income tax -- benefit from the reduction.Millionaires: $1,400 per yearThe third part of Burke’s claim goes back to the 2013 income tax cuts. The fiscal bureau estimated that people with an adjusted gross income of $300,000 or more would see a tax decrease averaging $1,402 in 2014.It’s worth noting that the $133 decrease for what Burke described as the average taxpayer was a reduction of 8 percent, while the the reduction for millionaires is 2.32 percent.And, again, she uses an annual figure for the millionaires, but a monthly one for the average folks.Our ratingBurke said that under Walker's ""tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.""The $11 refers only to income tax cuts, when in fact the typical taxpayer has also enjoyed property tax reductions. The $610 million applies to small businesses as well as corporations. And it’s correct that millionaires got at least $1,400 per year in tax reductions. In short, the claim uses different figures that when mashed together are misleading.For a statement that is partially accurate, but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu4yQTzxwqM,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sendem/LegislativeMemos/LFB%20memo%20to%20Sen%20%20Shilling%20re%20Distributional%20Information%20on%20Individual%20Income%20Tax%20Rate%20Reduction%20%287%2028%2014%29.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-misleads-about-tax-bill-breakdown/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-tax-cuts-amount-322-average-fami/,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sendem/LegislativeMemos/LFB-memo-Tax-Law-Changes-Since-January-2011.pdf,http://www.revenue.wi.gov/taxpro/fact/manufandagr.pdf,http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-checking-mary-burke-claim-on-scott-walker-tax-cuts-b99371887z1-279329862.html",,"Corporations,Income,State Budget,Wealth,Taxes,Wisconsin,Mary Burke",,,,,

Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""Our eyebrows were raised.

An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso.

Today, it's approaching 3 percent.""",,politifact,,"During a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014, President Barack Obama offered a rosy -- if cautious -- view on the state of the economy. One of the statistics he touted was this one:""When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent.""We wondered if he was correct.We looked at data from the Office of Management and Budget that tracks the federal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. Calculating it this way shows not the absolute level of the deficit but rather how big it is in relation to the size of the broader economy.The data shows that for fiscal year 2009, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 9.8 percent, while the projected percentage for fiscal year 2014 is 3.7 percent. But the timing of the Office of Management and Budget figures don’t coincide with Obama taking office.The 9.8 percent figure covers fiscal year 2009 -- which runs from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 31, 2009. In other words, it covers a little less than four months of President George W. Bush’s second term, and nearly eight months of Obama’s first term.In other words, the figure looks at an entire year that covers two presidencies -- not a snapshot on the day Obama took office, Jan. 20, 2009.That casts some doubt about the accuracy of how Obama framed the issue. Obama said, ""When I took office,"" which suggests that he inherited his predecessor’s deficit at nearly 10 percent of GDP and should get the credit for reducing it. The reality is that if Obama is going to claim some credit for reducing the deficit, he should also take some responsibility for pushing the deficit up to nearly 10 percent of GDP in his first fiscal year in office. Part of the reason the deficit was relatively high was because of the recession-fighting stimulus bill, which Obama championed.The deficit-to-GDP percentage for the fiscal year prior, 2008, was 3.1 percent. This gives a sense of what Obama inherited -- but it’s not a perfectly useful number, either, because it stops almost four months before Obama took office. During those four months, the economy was worsening rapidly, and spending on the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which aimed to stabilize the financial sector -- had begun adding to the deficit.So if one could figure out a percentage for the day Obama was inaugurated -- which actually can’t be done -- it would likely be somewhere between 3.1 percent and 9.8 percent.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021There’s another wrinkle in comparing deficits to the economy overall and then trying to take credit for improvements.While it’s relatively easy to assign credit or blame for government spending, which helps shape the size of the country’s deficit, it is not nearly as easy to credit or blame Obama for the overall state of the economy as measured by GDP.""The impact of a president on the economy is tough to measure,"" said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. ""So taking credit for a normalizing economy and the associated normalizing of the budget deficit is generally pushing it in my book.""The transition from Bush to Obama is especially tough to parse, as these past PolitiFact articles show.The White House argued to PolitiFact that the deficit projected at the beginning of his first term, once you factor out the pricetag for the stimulus and related debt service, was 9.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. Looking at it this way has merit, but for a retrospective claim like this, we think it’s worth giving credence to hard numbers over initial projections. And we’d reiterate that some of the spending that took place before he was inaugurated, such as TARP, had the support of then-President-Elect Obama.""It would have been better for him to say, ‘In my first year in office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of GDP,’ "" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.Our rulingObama said, ""When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent.""Actually, the deficit reached 10 percent of the economy several months after Obama took office, not on his first day. Obama is laying the blame for the high deficit-to-GDP ratio entirely on Bush, when the figure covers time in office for both presidents. In reality, the numbers are more nuanced than he lets on, and his formulation oversimplifies the factors that played into these trends, some of which he had control over and some of which he didn’t.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.","https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/02/remarks-president-economy-northwestern-university,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2015/assets/hist.pdf,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/23/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-says-barack-obama-has-lowest-s/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/may/25/lots-heat-and-some-light-obamas-spending/,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2010-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2010-BUD-28.pdf",,"National,Deficit,Economy,Federal Budget,Barack Obama",,,,,

The lawsuit accused Dollar General of paying male managers more than female managers for the same work.The new ad from super PAC Georgians Together opens talking about the wage discrimination lawsuit, which was settled by Dollar General’s parent company for $18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company.The ad closes with these lines: ""David Perdue -- Georgia women just can’t trust him. Michelle Nunn -- Georgia women can always trust her.""For our fact check, we reached out to Keith Mason, a longtime Democratic operative and treasurer of Georgians Together, the super PAC that was launched to support Nunn’s campaign and that is funding the new ad.We asked for evidence to support the ad claim that Perdue proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care.""Perdue supports outright repeal of ACA [the Affordable Care Act],"" Mason said in an email.Perdue has had on his campaign website that he wants to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Mason said.He also pointed us to a news report that Perdue and four of his primary opponents publicly backed a plan by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to strip funding for the ACA as part any government spending bill, an effort that led to a government shutdown and ultimately did not succeed.How does that translate to women’s health?Mason forwarded us a link to a Chicago Tribune story headlined: ""Numerous Affordable Care Act Provisions Specifically Benefit Women."" The article said most plans under the ACA include preventive care, and, for women, that means an annual ""well-woman visit,"" breast-feeding support, contraceptives, contraceptive counseling, annual mammograms and cervical cancer screenings.William S. Cluster, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said there’s an argument for stating that women of childbearing years would be more adversely impacted by repeal of the ACA.Women under 45 have more health care needs than men in the same age group, he said.Prior to the implementation of the ACA, premiums in the individual market were higher for women than for men and the coverage often excluded preventative care -- mammograms for example -- and maternity care, Custer said.""The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from charging different premiums to men and women. It also requires plans to offer maternity care and preventive health (coverage)."" he said. ‘So while a lot of Georgians would lose coverage, or face higher costs with the repeal of the ACA, women may feel that loss more than men.""Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the candidate’s position has been clear.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021""David does support the outright repeal of Obamacare,"" Dickey said.Perdue would like to see it replaced with ""a consumer-driven"" alternative, such as U.S. Rep. Tom Price’s Empowering Patients First Act, the spokesman said.  But the ad claim by the Nunn camp is ""misleading,"" Dickey said.""If the Nunn campaign thinks repealing Obamacare is ‘rolling back the clock on women’s health care,’ they should just say that,"" he said. ""However, they can’t because Obamacare is incredibly unpopular.""Polls indicate Dickey’s right on the public’s sentiment.In a poll taken in August and September, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that public opinion of the Affordable Care Act remains more negative than positive. Among registered voters, 49 percent view the law unfavorably, 35 percent favorably. Opinion tilts even more negatively among likely voters, 51 percent vs. 35 percent, the poll found.Republicans in Congress have repeatedly maneuvered over the past four years to try to repeal or defund the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012.Some political analysts link the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement and the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in the 2010 midterm elections to the public furor over the law’s debate and enactment.Kerwin Swint, head of the political science department at Kennesaw State University, said he ""completely understands"" the strategy behind the Georgians Together ad claim.""The Nunn camp and their supporters want to take full advantage of the gender gap by driving up Perdue's negatives among female voters,"" Swint said. ""But if their only evidence for ‘rolling back the clock on women's health care’ is Perdue's support for repealing the ACA, that's pretty flimsy.""The latest reports show about 316,00 Georgians have selected marketplace plans, 57 percent females and 43 percent malesLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said these type of ads have become standard in Democratic campaigns this year. If its not ACA repeal, its GOP backing of a personhood amendment or backing of stricter controls on abortion, Sabato said.""Democrats have to do everything possible to expand the gender gap in their direction. Control of the Senate is riding on whether women heavily support candidates such as Nunn,"" he said. ""Republicans will carry men, as usual, and Democrats will win women, but the margins matter.""Our Ruling.The super PAC, Georgians Together, makes a claim that contains some truth. Some women could be hurt by repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which has expanded some benefits for some women.But the ad never mentions Obamacare. That’s a major omission.Voters also need to know what Perdue is proposing -- repeal and replacement of Obamacare -- others have tried to do and failed.And you could argue that almost any group helped by Obamacare could be hurt with its repeal.There is a lot of missing context in this attack ad.We rate it Half True.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"Georgia,Health Care,Georgians Together",,,,,

Eisenhower … saluted military personnel"" as president.",,politifact,,"You likely heard this already, but some conservatives and members of the military are upset that President Barack Obama saluted to Marines on Tuesday while holding a cup. Others are coming to Obama’s defense.We can summarize the incident in three short snippets. (And don’t worry, there’s a fact-check coming.)First, here’s video of the incident, which was released on the White House Instagram page:And here’s a slice of the reaction, this one from Fox News commentator and former President George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove.""Look, he knows there are going to be two Marines at the bottom of Marine One when he gets off, and the idea that I’m going to just jaunt out there with my chai tea, and give them the old … you know it’s not a latte salute, it’s a chai salute, because he drinks chai tea, but I mean please, how disrespectful was that?"" Rove asked.Lastly, we found this defense of Obama on the website, Taskandpurpose.com.""There’s no regulation that stipulates presidents must salute the troops. In fact, for the first 192 years of our republic, it didn’t happen. None of the first 38 commanders in chief did it,"" wrote Brian Adam Jones.To prove it, Jones quotes from MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s 2012 book Drift. Maddow says saluting was a thing started by Ronald Reagan.""Soldiers were supposed to salute their president; the president was not supposed to salute the soldiers. No modern president, not even old Gen. Eisenhower, had saluted military personnel. It might even be, well, sort of, improper."" (The passage starts on Page 36.)We wouldn’t normally dig up a claim a few years old, but the current fascination with the presidential salute and Jones' post had us wondering about Maddow’s claim that ""not even old Gen. Eisenhower, had saluted military personnel.""YouTube and archival video proves this claim wrong.As President-elect, Eisenhower visited Korea during the Korean War. In this video, Eisenhower clearly salutes American and United Nations troops. The salute is about 2 minutes, 30 seconds in.If you need proof of Eisenhower saluting the troops after taking the Oath of Office and in civilian clothes, he did so on Nov. 10, 1954, while attending the dedication of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial.Footage of the dedication clearly shows Eisenhower saluting military personnel, first when he exits a car and later as he is walking past Marines.Or here’s a clip from 1953, where Eisenhower is awarding the Medal of Honor to Korean War soldiers. He salutes at the 1:15 mark and again around 2:57.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021This 1959 video shows Eisenhower saluting what appear to be Italian troops, about 40 seconds in, and again at about 1 minute, 15 seconds.So clearly Eisenhower did salute military personnel as president, contrary to Maddow's claim.We suspect Maddow’s basis for her description may have roots in a 2007 New York Times opinion piece by Garry Wills, a professor emeritus of history at Northwestern University, as well as a 2004 op-ed by then-Reagan military aide and now-Minnesota U.S. Rep. John Kline.Wills was writing about presidents saluting soldiers when they board and exit Marine One (just like Obama on Tuesday).""We are reminded, for instance, of the expanded commander in chief status every time a modern president gets off the White House helicopter and returns the salute of marines.""That is an innovation that was begun by Ronald Reagan. Dwight Eisenhower, a real general, knew that the salute is for the uniform, and as president he was not wearing one. An exchange of salutes was out of order.""We couldn’t locate a copy of Kline’s op-ed, which ran in The Hill, but a 2008 Reuters account of the op-ed describes Reagan taking up the saluting issue with Gen. Robert Barrow, who was the commandant of the Marine Corps.Reagan explained as much in a 1986 speech to service members and their families.""I can't resist telling you a little story that I've just told the marine guard at the Embassy. The story has to do with saluting. I was a second lieutenant of horse cavalry back in the World War II days. As I told the admiral, I wound up flying a desk for the Army Air Force. And so, I know all the rules about not saluting in civilian clothes and so forth, and when you should or shouldn't. But then when I got this job -- (laughter) -- and I would be approaching Air Force One or Marine One and those Marines would come to a salute and I -- knowing that I am in civilian clothes -- I would nod and say ‘Hello’ and think they could drop their hand, and they wouldn't. They just stood there. So, one night over at the commandant's quarters, Marine Commandant's quarters in Washington, and I was getting a couple of highballs, and I didn't -- (laughter) -- know what to do with them. So, I said to the commandant -- I said, ‘Look, I know all the rules about saluting in civilian clothes and all, but if I am the Commander in Chief, there ought to be a regulation that would permit me to return a salute.’ And I heard some words of wisdom. He said, ‘I think if you did, no one would say anything.’""So, if you see me on television and I'm saluting, you know that I've got authority for it now -- (laughter) -- and I do it happily.""For the record, Army regulations simply say soldiers are not required to salute when they are in civilian clothes.What to make of all of this?Reagan does appear to be the first president who made the presidential salute commonplace, especially when exiting or boarding Air Force One or Marine One. But Eisenhower did return salute of military members while he served as president, including when he was in civilian attire.In an emailed response to PunditFact, Maddow said Reagan started the presidential salute as a regular, daily feature.""He started it -- other presidents have continued the practice since then,"" Maddow said. ""That’s the truth.""Acknowledging that truth is not the same thing as saying that no president ever threw a salute, on occasion, before then,"" she said.Our rulingMaddow wrote, ""Not even old Gen. Eisenhower … saluted military personnel"" as president.For the record, no president is required to salute military personnel. And presidential salutes did not become commonplace until Reagan became president.But Eisenhower, a five-star U.S. Army general, did salute ""military personnel"" as president, at least occasionally. We searched archived videos for about 90 minutes and found video evidence of seven salutes. Does that mean he did it all the time? No.Reagan perhaps made the practice routine, but Eisenhower did salute military personnel. We rate Maddow's claim Mostly False.","http://foxnewsinsider.com/2014/09/23/%E2%80%98how-disrespectful-was-that%E2%80%99-karl-rove-blasts-obama%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98latte-salute%E2%80%99,http://taskandpurpose.com/sorry-presidential-salute-isnt-real-thing/,http://taskandpurpose.com/author/brianadamjones/,http://books.google.com/books?id=5rmWtLHPa8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rachel+maddow+drift&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V_4iVNjoItSzyASO-IKQAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=eisenhower%20&f=false,http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675058223_Dwight-Eisenhower_United-Nations-troops_President-Syngman-Rhee_Korean-War,http://www.nps.gov/gwmp/historyculture/usmcwarmemorial.htm,http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675020751_President-Dwight-D-Eisenhower_Medals-of-Honor_Hiroshi-Miyamura_James-L-Stone,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://www.britishpathe.com/video/eisenhower-arrives-in-rome/query/EISENHOWER+INSPECTS,http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/101286a.htm,http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_25.pdf",,"History,Military,PunditFact,Rachel Maddow",,,,,

The post, which was also linked to elsewhere on the Internet, goes on to say:""It is being reported that at least 3 of the 5 detainees involved in the swap have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq as commanders and are using that rank to usher in an 'Islamic Caliphate' (a Sunni Islamic Theocracy -- contrary to Obama's claims that ISIS is not Islamic).""The 'Taliban 5' who were transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to custody in Doha, Qatar, are Mohammad Fazl, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari.

He continued: ""The Dallas Morning News reports that ‘Texas spends nearly $60 billion a year on its schools, which includes billions in federal funding and local property tax revenue.’ Texas has five million students in public schools. So,"" Mackowiak wrote, ""we spend an average of $12,000 per pupil per year. That is more than some four-year colleges. Is that not sufficient?""A reader asked us to check his per-pupil figure.By email, Mackowiak confirmed he took the total spending mentioned in the Morning News and divided that by 5 million to get his per-student estimate.Curiously, the News story included a chart presenting a per-student Texas spending figure, attributed to the Legislative Budget Board, of $5,809 statewide for 2013-14. By email, a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, said the figure represents what the state in 2013 expected school districts to spend in state and local revenue on general operations in the fiscal year through September 2014. A May 2013 chart posted online by the budget board lists predicted per-student expenditures for each district; the Austin district, for instance, was expected to spend $6,220 per student.Then again, DeSilva said the figure, incorporating school funding decisions by the 2013 Legislature, did not add in other funding such as federal aid or state grants not part of the state Foundation School Program, the main way state aid flows to schools.There are various ways to estimate spending per student.A teacher lobby group, the National Education Association, annually estimates combined state and local school spending. In its latest report, released in March 2014, the association said Texas schools spent an average of $8,275 per student enrolled in the fall of the 2012-13 school year. That was the fifth-lowest amount among the states; Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah and Arizona spent less while nationally the average was $10,938 per student, the group said. According to another chart in the report, Texas was expected to spend at least $8,399 per student in 2013-14.By email, an association analyst, Robert Glenn, said the presented figures took into account state, federal and local spending on general operations, but excluded capital outlays for buildings and equipment and interest on school debt. The excluded items, Glenn said, are ""programs that are not part of the regular public elementary and secondary school program.""Separately, we asked the Texas Education Agency about per-student spending.By email, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency chart indicating that in 2012-13, the latest available year of actual expenditure data, Texas schools spent $10,549 per student from state, local and federal sources. That year, 5,057,960 students attended the public schools.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021For another perspective, we turned to a former TEA analyst, Lynn Moak, a partner in an Austin firm that advises school districts.By email, Moak suggested wrinkles in most of the per-student spending figures posted by the TEA.While the state reported $61.2 billion in total disbursements for public schools in 2012-13, or $12,106 per pupil, Moak said, about $7.3 billion of that didn’t reflect in-school spending. The rolled-in dollars, he said, included funds transferred among districts for equity purposes; money used to refinance bonds and lower interest costs; and charges for districts buying services from other districts.Another spending figure on the agency web page, $53.4 billion, or $10,549 per pupil, Moak said, would be a more accurate base for education spending -- though that too has weaknesses, he said, in that nearly $11 billion of the total went to debt service or capital outlays as in funds that could only be spent for building or equipping facilities or for interest and principal payments on school facilities, again not direct in-school spending. ""A portion of this amount is also double-counted over time because principal repayments represent  the same funds used for capital outlay,"" Moak wrote.Subtract the capital and debt expenditures, Moak said, and operating expenditures are reflected in another total on the web page, $42.6 billion, or $8,419 per pupil. Finally, Moak said, federal aid to the schools is usually restricted to certain programs. If most such categorical aid is left out, he said, education spending drops to $36 billion, a result based on combining $30 million in payroll costs and $6 million in other operating costs, for $7,127 per student.We also asked the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which says it’s ""dedicated to being the trusted resource for school finance and operations in Texas,"" to consider this topic. By email, the group’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, similarly said she wouldn’t generally count debt service and capital costs into average spending comparisons partly because, she said, such decisions reflect voter approval of bonds in individual districts.

Where did the money go? To Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax breaks and giveaways.""We've already rated False an earlier Greater Wisconsin Committee claim, that Walker gave $570 million in job-development incentives to his ""cronies"" or ""corporate friends."" Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past, many of the donations were small and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million.But what about the claim of Walker cutting school funding, on a per-student basis, more than any other governor?What we knowThere's no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker made a dramatic reduction in school funding.In fact, in February 2012 we rated True a broader claim -- that Walker had enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state's history."" The $1.2 billion in reductions included $792 million in direct state aid to kindergarten-through-12th grade schools, which is the focus of the new Greater Wisconsin Committee ad.But that fact-check didn't calculate the K-12 school cuts on a per-student basis in comparison to other states. And Walker later restored some of the state aid to schools.The committee’s evidenceBefore we dig in, a few words about wording.The Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim refers to funding of public schools. But, as we’ll see, the evidence the committee cites is overall spending by the schools -- in other words, what was spent in total from state, federal and local money.So, in addition to checking the overall spending figures the committee cited to us in support of its claim, we’ll examine state revenue figures -- the amount of money given to public schools strictly from the state.What the Greater Wisconsin Committee cited is a table from a solid source, the latest annual report from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) on public school financing.Issued in May 2014, the report covers the Wisconsin state fiscal year of 2011-’12, which is the first full fiscal year during Walker’s term in office.(The state’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30; in other words, roughly the same as the traditional school year.)On a percentage basis, Wisconsin’s reduction in overall per-pupil spending -- of state, federal and local money -- was at the top of the chart when compared with the previous year. In terms of cuts, here are the top five: State/DistrictPer-pupil SPENDING in 2011-’12 from ALL sourcesChange from 2010-’11 Wisconsin$11,042-6.2 percentFlorida$8,372-5.8 percentDistrict of Columbia$17,468-5.4 percentTexas$8,261-4.7 percentSouth Dakota$8,446Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021-4.1 percent In contrast, the census report shows that in the four years before Walker took office, Wisconsin’s per-student spending rose -- by 3.6 percent in 2010-’11, 2.6 percent in 2009-’10, 3.7 percent in 2008-’09 and 4 percent in 2007-’08. In terms of blaming Walker for the cuts, the governor, along with the Republican-controlled Legislature, had direct control over state money, which amounted to 48 percent of the spending by Wisconsin schools in 2011-’12.Through the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, Walker and the Legislature required employees to pay more toward their pension and enabled school districts to charge employees more for health insurance as a way to offset some of the state aid cuts. But as we noted in rating the biggest cuts in state history claim, the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation.Walker and the Legislature also had significant influence over local funding, which amounted to 44 percent of the schools’ spending, because they essentially froze the amount of property tax revenue that local school districts could raise.Walker had no real control over federal funding, which amounted to 8 percent of total spending by Wisconsin schools.Other measuresNow, using the same census report, let’s look at the revenue figures, focusing on how much state money went to Wisconsin schools.Once again, Wisconsin was at the top in terms of cuts. StatePer-pupil REVENUE in 2011-’12 from STATE GOVERNMENTChange from 2010-’11  Wisconsin $5,544-8.33 percentIdaho$4,630-6.79 percentArizona$3,018-6.46 percentWyoming$9,466-5.05 percentFlorida$3,273-4.84 percent So, the state revenue measure also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee claim.But there some newer figures available.A May 2014 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined state funding of schools in 2013-’14.Those figures show Wisconsin was among 15 states that reduced state per-student spending from the previous year. Wisconsin's 0.6 percent reduction (adjusted for inflation) wasn’t the largest cut, but rather the third-smallest. (Alaska’s 3.2 percent cut was the largest.)Wisconsin state funding was $5,747 per student in 2013-’14, versus $5,783 the previous year.As for comparing states on school funding for the entirety of Walker’s term, those figures simply aren’t available yet.Our ratingThe Greater Wisconsin Committee said: ""Scott Walker cut school funding more per student than any governor in America.""Based on the latest census figures, for 2011-’12, the Wisconsin cuts were the largest based on two measures -- state revenue provided to local schools and overall spending by schools of state, federal and local money.But more recent figures indicate that Wisconsin’s school spending cuts are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period.For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.","https://youtu.be/nT2Pgy6XVos,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/03/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-walker-gave-570-m/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/19/kathleen-falk/recall-candidate-kathleen-falk-says-governor-scott/,http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SSF_2012_SSF020.US01&prodType=table,http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/12f33pub.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=4011",,"Children,Education,Message Machine 2014,State Budget,States,Taxes,Wisconsin,Greater Wisconsin Committee",,,,,

The total was 69 as of this writing, so it could hit 100 by year's end, but it's not even close to that yet.So the number of shootings has not hit 100 for ""each year"" of the Taveras administration.The LeadHERship statement also ignores some significant context: The number of shootings, which peaked at 108 in 2011, declined in the subsequent two years of Taveras' tenure, dropping to 105 in 2012 and 100 in 2013.Before Taveras took office, the numbers were lower but steadily increasing. The annual total was 47 shootings in 2006 (during the tenure of his predecessor, David Cicilline), 58 in 2007, 77 in 2008, 86 in 2009, and 90 in 2010, Cicilline's final year, before jumping sharply to 108 during Taveras' first year.Because the statement is mostly accurate but ignores important context, we rate it Mostly True.(If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)","http://americanleadhership.org/,https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/24/angel-taveras/mayor-angel-taveras-says-crime-rate-shootings-have/,http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20140726-deadly-mix-of-feuds-joblessness-and-guns-on-providences-mean-streets.ece,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection",,"Rhode Island,Candidate Biography,Crime,Negative Campaigning,Public Safety,Guns,American LeadHERship PAC",,,,,

However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out.That said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson’s claim.We called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago.A difference, yes, but one of less than six percent.But even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don’t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana.For starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado’s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said.

It’s way too early to tell.""Trooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong’s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed.""Statistically, we’re essentially neck and neck with last year,"" he said. ""But there’s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there’s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data.""We tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado).Over the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine.The ruling:Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado’s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch.Colorado’s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013.Nothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that’s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson’s statement is true, but it omits important details and context.We rate it Half True.Thoughts on our ruling?

Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman.Indeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn’s next-day news conference.When the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer.MPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014.To be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021But Flynn had a talking point.When we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn.But their data tracked with the figure Flynn used  -- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason.To get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns.""I don’t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost,"" Stanmeyer said in an email. ""Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people.""He also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a  gun buyback program last spring that was led by faith leaders.So what’s the explanation for the similar numbers?First, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year.Bratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on Capitalnewyork.com that the number ""in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down."" The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago.""We’ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down,"" Bratton said in the article. ""It’s always going to go up at some point in time. We’ll always have the ability to push it down.""Another factor could be at work in New York.New Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to reform the department’s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes.Even before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had dropped sharply in the past two years.

""This isn't your parents' college education. Students -- young students -- are issuing outrageous amounts of debt to go to college and get a degree, and the only thing the schools are guaranteeing them after that is a bill.""Lynch said the injection of federal money is one of the reasons the costs have gone up so much. ""Education costs should not increase more than the rate of inflation.""  Critics have long argued that escalating government loan problems have pushed college costs higher and higher.A 1,200 percent increase means the cost of education is 13 times higher than in 1978.That sounded high to us, so we thought we'd check his statistic.Lynch said he based the number on an April 23, 2013 article on the business website fastcoexist.com, where it says -- in a story and in a graphic -- that since 1979, public and private college costs have increased 1,120 percent. It's based on a report by Bloomberg and Business Week.Lynch then added 33 percent a year for 2013 and 2014 and rounded it up to 1,200 percent.We confirmed the trend -- and got more up-to-date numbers -- by going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows a 1,172 percent increase from July 1978 to June 2014, which rounds up to the amount cited by Lynch.Lynch's problem: His statement doesn’t account for inflation, which increased the cost of things we buy -- from a dozen eggs to a college education -- by 265 percent from 1979 to 2012.We confirmed the numbers by turning to data from National Center for Education Statistics, which looks at costs a bit differently using dollar amounts from the schools as far back as the 1963-64 school year.

Then the average bill for the 2012-13 school year ($10,683) would be 194 percent higher, not 1,200 percent.The inflation-adjusted increases were 147 percent for private or nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, 234 percent for public four-year institutions and 147 percent for public two-year colleges.Point of interest: At URI, tuition and fees for in-state students totaled $924 for the 1977-78 school year. The total for 2012-13 was $12,450, an increase of 277 percent if you adjust for inflation and 1,247 percent if you don't.Our rulingCormick Lynch said the cost of ""college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978.""He should have made it clear that he wasn't adjusting for inflation.His statement is only close to true if the median household income had remained at $15,000 per year (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and a loaf of bread was still 54 cents (as it was in 1978, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics).If you adjust those tuition numbers for the rising cost of living, Lynch's percentage is six times too high.The statement is accurate in the sense that college cost have increased many times faster than the cost of other things we buy.

It was captured most recently by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster, who spent nearly $3.2 million in her bid to defeat former Republican Congressman Charles Bass.All that politicking means it’s not unusual for voters to find lots of glossy campaign material in the mailbox as the November election approaches. But when a full-color postcard bearing Kuster’s name and likeness was distributed at taxpayer expense, it drew fire from her opponents.The campaign staff for one of Kuster’s GOP opponents, Marilinda Garcia, accused Kuster of using taxpayer money to send campaign mail, which would be a violation.Kuster ""used 293K of your tax $ for campaign mail,"" tweeted Tom Szold, Garcia’s campaign manager.  We decided this was a job for PolitiFact.Rules in place for more than a century allow U.S. senators and representatives to use federal money to communicate with their constituents, using their signature to take the place of postage on mass mailings.The Congressional ""frank"" -- as the privilege is called -- is meant to allow elected officials to keep voters apprised of what’s going on in Washington. Politicians are forbidden from using the privilege for campaigning or self promotion.Kuster’s use of franked mail came under scrutiny by the New Hampshire Union Leader, which reported in June 2013 that Kuster has spent close to $293,000 on franked communications -- six times more than the rest of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation combined, the newspaper reported. The paper highlighted a postcard encouraging constituents to visit Kuster’s website and sign up for her electronic newsletter.Rules of the frankCongress has wrestled for decades with the question of what material is appropriate to send with taxpayer money without crossing into the realm of electioneering.Most recently, a six-member commission on Congressional mailing standards authored a detailed manual in 1998 laying out guidelines for material that can be sent using the frank.Guidelines in the manual discourage politicians from using their names or referring to themselves -- or even using a personal pronoun -- more than eight times on a single page.The regulations also prohibit most autobiographical material, reports on family life, personal hobbies or community service activities. Politicians also are prohibited from using franked mail for birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages or holiday greetings.When it comes to political content, franked mail cannot contain specific references to past or future campaigns or elections, including re-election announcements and schedules of campaign related events.Politicians are asked to avoid ""excessive"" use of party labels -- defined as generally being more than two per page -- and materials used in campaign literature or campaign pledges or promises, including photos, logos and slogans, can’t be reproduced in franked mail.Before any communications are authorized, they must be reviewed by the Franking Commission, a body established under the Committee on House Administration. Staff members serving under both Democratic and Republican committee members review the material to ensure it adheres to the guidelines.Kuster’s communicationsPolitifact New Hampshire analyzed 26 franked communications Kuster was authorized to send out since she took office in 2013. They ranged from welcome letters for new residents -- offering her assistance ordering flags or planning visits to Washington D.C. -- to newsletters, surveys and scripts for telephone town halls.Kuster was also authorized to use her franking privilege to purchase several advertisements on Facebook asking constituents to ""Like"" her Facebook page.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021""Granite Staters have a problem solver in Congress. Like my page and follow me!"" reads one advertisement that was authorized in 2013. It was accompanied by a photo of the Congressional seal.Garcia’s campaign argues the franked communications raise red flags because they don’t offer specific explanations of Kuster’s policy positions, and instead make generic statements that have the ring of election stumping. Garcia’s camp also criticized Kuster for using franked mail to invite residents to follow her social media accounts, and for including material that resembles her campaign literature.Szold said that the talking points used in Kuster’s 2014 re-election campaign mirror the subjects she has highlighted in her franked communications.Kuster’s spokeswoman, Rosie Hilmer, defended the use of franked mail, saying it helps Kuster advocate for the needs of her constituents in Washington. She pointed out that every piece of mail undergoes a rigorous approval process by the Franking Commission.""Franked mail is an important tool that gives Congresswoman Kuster an opportunity to communicate directly with her constituents and let them know about important resources and issues they care about,"" Hilmer said.Campaign-like statementsWe couldn’t find any flagrant violations of the franking commission’s guidelines, but Garcia’s campaign has a point that some statements that appear in Kuster’s franked mail bear resemblance to material in her campaign literature.For example, when Kuster was campaigning in 2012, she wrote in an op-ed published in The Telegraph that she hoped to ""bring a new approach to Washington that’s focused on common-sense solutions to create jobs, strengthen our economy and grow the middle class.""Similar language appears in a constituent survey that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2013. It reads: ""Your voice matters and helps me as I work with members of both parties to find common sense solutions to help create jobs, grow New Hampshire's economy, and strengthen our middle class.""When she was seeking to advertise an upcoming job fair in 2013, Kuster prepared a robocall script that stated her ""top priority in Congress is helping create jobs and opportunity for middle class families.""A similar phrase now appears on Kuster’s 2014 campaign website, which states that since taking office, ""Annie has made creating jobs and opportunity for Granite State families her number one priority.""The campaign website indicates that Kuster is focused on passing measures to grow New Hampshire’s economy and create middle class jobs -- a package of legislation Kuster refers to as her ""Jobs and Opportunity Agenda.""Kuster also referenced her ""Jobs and Middle Class Opportunity Agenda"" in an automated phone call that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2014, and highlighted her ""Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Agenda"" in a piece of franked mail.Another automated phone call authorized by the Franking Commission focused on women’s issues.""I'm holding a live Telephone Town Hall to share with you my Women's Economic Agenda and hear your thoughts on how we can level the playing field for New Hampshire women,"" the script reads.Kuster’s 2014 campaign website contains similar language.""Annie also recently unveiled an Economic Agenda for Women and Families, which advocates support for critical reforms that will help level the playing field for Granite State women and their families,"" it reads.Our rulingMarilinda Garcia’s campaign said that Kuster uses taxpayer money to send campaign mail. Kuster did spend a good deal more on franked mail than other members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, and some of the language that appears in those communications is similar or identical to language used in her campaign materials.In the same vein, some of the subjects that came up in Kuster’s newsletters and telephone town halls track closely with the issues highlighted on her campaign website, such as student loan debt, support for veterans, advocacy on women’s issues and protection for Social Security and Medicare.But as Kuster’s spokeswoman pointed out, all of the franked communications were reviewed by a panel of both Republicans and Democrats, and those that were authorized weren’t found to violate any of the Franking Commission’s guidelines. Those guidelines are designed to ensure franked mail isn’t being used to support a reelection campaign.While some voters may have trouble distinguishing between Kuster’s franked mail and her campaign mail, it appears Kuster stayed within the letter of the law. The Franking Commission has not received any complaints about her communications, nor has it found she violated any rules.There’s an element of truth to Garcia’s statement, but overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.","https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/elections.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00030875&type=I,http://cha.house.gov/sites/republicans.cha.house.gov/files/documents/franking_docs/franking_manual.pdf,https://db.tt/Zt0A0uae,https://db.tt/XJNxuD18,https://db.tt/rNc8tj2Z,https://db.tt/Wv3iI1UN,https://db.tt/wg7qiOPq,https://db.tt/xZlgHyD3,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/post-about-keystone-pipeline-falsely-claims-buffet/,https://db.tt/2u0VKSZ3,https://db.tt/a7wLgHOT,https://db.tt/X5jyDFVJ,http://kusterforcongress.com/issues/jobs-and-the-economy,http://kusterforcongress.com/issues/jobs-and-the-economy,https://db.tt/kcJlJSqd,https://db.tt/IjAVEGuU,http://kusterforcongress.com/issues/advocating-for-women",,"New Hampshire,Campaign Finance,Ethics,Marilinda Garcia",,,,,

Created by the liberal group Occupy Democrats, it said, ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states. But tell me again how Republican policies grow the economy?""This was a variation on a few memes we’ve checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True).While the meme’s suggestion that ""Republican policies"" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states.""First, we’ll explain our methodology.To determine the nation’s 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty.As for determining whether a state is ""red"" or ""blue,"" we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.)So how did the data turn out?For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states:1. Owsley County, Ky.2. Jefferson County, Miss.3. Wolfe County, Ky.4. Brooks County, Texas5. McCreary County, Ky.6. Hudspeth County, Texas7. Hancock County, Tenn.8. Jackson County, Ky.9. Clay County, Ky.10. Holmes County, Miss.For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states.Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states:Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 20211. Shannon County, S.D.2. Clay County, Ga.3. East Carroll Parish, La.4. Sioux County, N.D.5. Todd County, S.D.6. Hudspeth County, Texas7. Holmes County, Miss.8. Corson County, S.D.9. Wolfe County, Ky.10. Humphreys County, Miss.So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don’t have much to quibble with.Our bigger question concerns whether it’s significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There’s reason for at least a bit of skepticism.For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas.Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states.It’s also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That’s a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices.In Appalachia, ""it’s clear there’s a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education,"" said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky.Finally, there’s an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties. Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120.This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed.Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14.Our rulingThe meme said that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states."" According to the most recent data, that’s a few percentage points high, but not by much.However, measuring a county’s lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme’s political message.The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","https://twitter.com/ChrisJZullo/status/493617354429841408,http://www.occupydemocrats.com/,https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/28/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,http://www.charlestoncounty.org/stats/bystate.htm",,"National,County Government,Poverty,Facebook posts",,,,,

Circuit issued a 2-1 ruling that said people in states that don't operate their own marketplaces can't get subsidies. But a few hours later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in King vs. Burwell. Their unanimous decision upheld the legality of the subsidies for all states, even those without their own insurance marketplaces.That same day Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair and congresswoman from Florida, appeared on the Nevada news program Ralston Reports.""There was a lot of panic from supporters of the law after the Halbig decision came down from the panel at the D.C. court,"" said host Jon Ralston. But Wasserman Schultz said she thought it would be resolved in favor of maintaining the subsides for all states.""I think ultimately, when the Supreme Court decides this, it’s going to be very clear that the unanimous ruling by the Fourth Circuit is the right one.""She also said Nevada had ""a governor who refused to implement a state exchange."" She quickly had to backtrack as Ralston reminded her of Gov. Brian Sandoval’s enthusiastic support of a state exchange. ""Well, I stand corrected, I’m not from Nevada,"" Wasserman Schultz acknowledged.But she went on to make another claim we found questionable.""There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange, and as a result people who get Affordable Care Act plans are getting them through the federal exchange,"" Wasserman Schultz said.It turns out that Wasserman Schultz was off on this claim, too.Numbers don’t lieUsing information compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, we looked at each state’s marketplace profile. We found a total of 36 states that currently use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships and would be affected by Halbig vs. Burwell. We sorted them into four categories.States with Republican governors that adopted the federal exchange: 27States with Democratic governors that adopted the federal exchange: 2States with Republican governors that adopted a state-federal partnership: 2Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021States with Democratic governors that adopted state-federal partnership: 5So of the 36 states that use the federal exchange or a partnership program, only 29 actually had Republican governors when the decisions were made about establishing health care marketplaces.In 27 of those states, Republican governors opted to use the federally established marketplace, Heathcare.gov, instead of a state-run program.This number includes New Mexico and Idaho, whose Republican governors originally aimed to establish state-based marketplaces in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Both states ended up choosing a federally-facilitated marketplace but hope to open their own state-based marketplaces in 2014.It also includes Utah, a state that had an insurance marketplace established before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010. In Utah, the federal government runs the market for individual insurance, but the state controls the insurance exchange for small businesses.There are two Republican-led states, Iowa and Michigan, that supported independent state marketplaces, but ended up establishing state-federal partnerships instead. State-federal partnerships allow the states to play a role in the insurance marketplace, without assuming full responsibility.In 2012, Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad announced that the state would operate on a state-federal partnership for the time being. Branstad said they plan to transition to a state insurance marketplace by 2016. And in Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder supported the creation of a state-based marketplace, but opted for the partnership in 2012.Republican governors were not alone in their decision to use the federal exchange or set up state-federal partnerships. Seven states with Democratic governors did it, too.Of the seven states, two use the federal exchange, while five operate partnership marketplaces. For example, in Missouri, Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon  attempted to set up a state marketplace in 2012, but voters blocked his attempts. Ultimately, Nixon was forced to back away from a state marketplace. In Montana, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer opted for the federally run insurance marketplace.The other five Democratic states that operate a state-federal partnership are New Hampshire, Delaware, West Virginia, Illinois and Arkansas.In New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan established the partnership marketplace in February of 2013. Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn laid out a plan similar to that used in Iowa. The state is currently using a partnership exchange, but plans to establish a state marketplace by 2015.DNC spokesman Michael Czin said that Wasserman Schultz meant to say there were ""26 Republican governors who used the federal exchange this year instead of setting up their own state-based exchange."" Czin was counting the number of states now that have Republican governors.We think it’s more accurate to counts states that had Republican governors when the exchanges were set up, and that number would be 27 (not counting the two GOP governors that set up partnership exchanges).Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that there were ""36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange."" There are 36 states that use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships instead of state-based marketplaces. But seven of those states are run by Democrats. And, some of the states with Republican governors, like New Mexico and Idaho, tried to institute a state exchange before opting for federally-facilitated marketplace. So while most of the 36 states had Republican governors, not all of them did.We rate this statement Mostly False.","http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/10125254D91F8BAC85257D1D004E6176/%24file/14-5018-1503850.pdf,http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/141158.P.pdf,http://www.mynews3.com/content/video/default.aspx?videoID=5238884,http://www.mynews3.com/content/video/default.aspx?videoID=5238884,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/nevade-governor-brian-sandoval-obamacare-affordable-care-act-health-care-100801.html,http://kff.org/state-health-marketplace-profiles/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-health-exchange-s-online-market-faces-obstacles/article_dd82cd3e-f7fe-5a7e-9105-fb0575016ae2.html,http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/07/22/3290820/appeals-court-undercuts-key-tax.html,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-iowa/,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-michigan/,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-missouri/,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-montana/,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-new-hampshire/,http://kff.org/health-reform/state-profile/state-exchange-profiles-illinois/",,"National,Health Care,Supreme Court,Debbie Wasserman Schultz",,,,,

But it's unlike any Thor we've ever seen before,"" said series writer Jason Aaron in a statement.This does not mean, as Goldberg wrongly said, that it’s the first time a woman will hold Mjölnir.The editor of the upcoming series, Wil Moss, addressed this point in a Q&A with Time without going into specifics.Time: ""Has there ever been a female Thor before?""Moss: ""There have been occasional alternate universe stories where there have been female Thors. And there have been occasional stories where a female has picked up the hammer; like there’s an X-Men story where Storm picked up the hammer. But there’s never been a female Thor.""The inscription of Mjölnir reads: ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""

This often happens when Thor has been incapacitated or is being punished by his father Odin in alternate storylines and the main canon.We found examples from reddit, the website Den of Geek and Johnson.The earliest example of a woman wielding the hammer is Jane Foster, Thor’s human love interest, in a 1978 What If? issue (No. 1 on this list). In this alternate storyline, she discovered the hammer and became Thordis, saving Thor’s alter ego Donald Blake and beating off alien rock monsters.In another alternate reality issue in 1994, Rogue of the X-Men used her mutant power of absorbing others’ powers and basically sucked up Thor’s life force, using his hammer to wreak destruction on Thor’s alien realm, Asgard, before seeing the light and becoming the hero.Our reader pointed us to a 1996 crossover event between DC Comics and Marvel in which DC’s Wonder Woman wielded Mjölnir. Wonder Woman obtained the hammer and its powers ahead of a showdown with Marvel’s Storm, a female character from the X-Men, but decided not to use it because it would not be a fair fight. (And so she lost.)And then there was the Earth-X miniseries in which Odin transformed Thor into a female version of himself per the urging of Thor’s mischievous brother Loki (see the cover). This was an alternate future timeline, and some reasonable comic fans may argue (as a few did in our reddit thread) that those are considered non-canon and should not count.Still, Storm is one example of a woman who held the hammer in a story within regular continuity ""if people are worried about it,"" Johnson said. Storm uses Thor’s hammer in the 2011 comic X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3 to destroy an imitation hammer called Stormcaster given to her by Loki (again, bad intentions) in a 1985 comic.Other female hammer-holders include Black Widow and Crusader, both in What If scenarios. Read Den of Geek for more. Another character, Tarene, aka Thor Girl, had her own hammer but did not use Thor’s Mjölnir.Our rulingGoldberg said Thor ""is no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his. And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman.""It appears Goldberg mixed up her talking points.While this is the first time a woman will be Thor, it’s not the first time a woman has held Thor’s hammer.

For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he did use an executive order recently to raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour.The use of executive orders picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. The current record holder is Franklin Roosevelt, who issued 3,522 executive orders throughout his time in office.Here’s what we found for the past 10 presidents, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara:PresidentNumber of executive ordersObama182George W.

Kim • February 1, 2021320Gerald Ford169Richard Nixon346Lyndon Johnson325John F. Kennedy214 So in the past 50 years, Obama has so far signed fewer executive orders than every other president except two -- Gerald Ford (who finished Richard Nixon’s second term) and George H. W. Bush (who served one term). And he’s signed fewer per day than every president back to Grover Cleveland, according to research by the Brookings Institution.But O’Rourke said ‘actions’O’Rourke is on solid ground had he said ""executive orders."" But he said ""executive actions.""That’s a different and tougher to prove statistic.Executive action is a hard-to-define and broad category that encompasses any unilateral presidential action -- including the executive orders listed above, pardoning criminals, amending the internal structure of the executive branch, issuing signing statements, writing letters and memoranda, and more.The White House recently released a document touting 45 solo actions Obama has taken this year alone. The list includes his executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal employees. It also talks about his recently unveiled Environmental Protection Agency plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent, which is not an executive order. And there are smaller measures, like creating working groups and encouraging local leaders to commit to end veteran homelessness.John Woolley, a political science professor at University of California Santa Barbara, outlined three types of executive actions:Officially enumerated orders and proclamations;Presidential orders conveyed in writing in forms other than executive orders and proclamations;Discretionary actions by executive agencies that a president encourages or tolerates and could stop or reverse.Woolley noted, though, that while the federal register catalogs executive orders, there is not a consolidated tally of all executive actions.This makes comparing Obama’s use of unilateral action to other presidents’ difficult, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.""There is no single metric you can point to and say, ‘This president has executed more unilateral actions than other presidents,’ "" Mayer said.Additionally, some scholars and politicians might disagree on what counts as unilateral presidential action and how important that particular action is, he added.But based on his research, Mayer said Obama has done nothing exceptional in terms of unilateral actions, compared to other presidents. Similar criticisms have been thrown at presidents from the opposing party for centuries, starting with George Washington’s decision to proclaim neutrality in the war between England and France.But unless agencies or scholars start to tally and examine all executive actions, not just orders, it may be impossible to quantify a president’s use of unilateral power.""People who say Obama has issued fewer (or certainly no more) executive orders than his immediate predecessors are correct,"" Woolley said. ""However, the claim that he has directed fewer executive branch discretionary actions is far less certain.For the record, O’Rourke’s office provided us evidence about executive orders, not executive actions.Our rulingO’Rourke said, ""This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history.""People often point to the number of a president’s executive orders to indicate his use of unilateral action, and by that metric, Obama has a lower record than most presidents in recent history. That’s likely what O’Rourke meant when he said ""executive action."" But executive action includes much more than just orders, and there’s no way to definitively calculate how many Obama has carried out in order to compare him to other presidents.O’Rourke is right when it comes to one type of executive action -- executive orders -- but the rest of the record is unclear. As such, we rate, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Half True.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-remarks-on-immigration/2014/06/30/b3546b4e-0085-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/11/case-for-obamas-impeachment-constitutions-remedy-for-lawless-imperial-president/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2014/01/30-state-of-the-union-obama-executive-orders-hudak,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/516/no-signing-statements-nullify-instruction-congress/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/year_of_action_update_final.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/1104/set-standard-utility-companies-80-percent-nations-/",,"National,Supreme Court,Beto O'Rourke",,,,,

At the top, if not a desire to roll back Obamacare, would likely be the longtime GOP stance opposing any tax increase.So it’s no small thing for U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston to brand businessman David Perdue, his rival in the Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate, as a tax supporter.The ad in question, featuring a voicemail for Kingston left by a President Obama impersonator, is to the point: ""Perdue said he’d raise taxes. You never even voted for a tax increase.""The Kingston camp pointed us to two Perdue statements: one from a May meeting with the Macon Telegraph editorial board and the other from a candidate forum from January.""Mr. Perdue has repeatedly advocated for tax increases,"" Kingston campaign manager Chris Crawford said.That seems clear enough. But digging into the details, as PolitiFact does, clouds things up a bit.Perdue, a former CEO who has built his campaign focused as an outsider to politics, told the editorial board he supported ""both"" curbing spending and increasing revenue to boost the economy.When a member of the board calls revenue increases ""a euphemism for some kind of tax increase, of course,"" Perdue talks about the need to grow business and grow revenue.Crawford notes that Perdue chuckles before he speaks but doesn’t outright deny support for a tax increase.In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue said his point in the meeting was to focus not just on the economy but how to use the economy to help pay down the national debt.""We can balance the budget by cutting spending, and that’s where you start,"" Perdue said. ""But an $18 trillion debt will require an economy that’s growing, with people back to work, like we did in the ‘60s, ‘80s and even the ‘90s.""An Internet sales tax, or a tax on online sales similar to those made at physical stores, would also increase revenue.Now, people who buy from online retailers are supposed to report their purchases on their state tax returns and pay.

Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021Georgia lost an estimated $410 million in uncollected online sales tax in 2012, according to a study  from the University of Tennessee’s Center for Business and Economic Research.The Marketplace Fairness Act would permit state and local governments to collect sales taxes from internet retailers that do not have a physical location in their jurisdictions. It passed the Senate last year but has been held up in the GOP-run House, with conservative members labeling it a tax hike.Perdue said at the January candidate forum that he supported the concept of the bill to make sure there was ""an even playing field"" for all retailers.""Frankly, I think whether you have brick-and-mortar or Internet sales, we should have the same rules apply to both,"" Perdue said at the event.He recently clarified with PolitiFact that his support falls under his advocacy of a Fair Tax, which would replace existing federal income taxes with a national 23 percent sales tax on all new goods and services, including those bought on the internet.Critics the Fair Tax, note that the proposal is regressive – that is, it disproportionately hurts people with lower incomes who spend more of their wages and therefore pay a higher tax rate.Perdue acknowledges that the current proposal would need tweaks to avoid that problem. But he believes taxing consumption – including buying new products from Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet – is a change that needs to happen.""I would argue that it would reduce taxes, because it would have greater growth in the economy,"" Perdue said.Kingston has made that argument, too, notes staffer Crawford. In fact, Kingston reiterated support for the Fair Tax during the same January forum but refused to support an internet sales tax as an incremental measure.""If David Perdue wanted to equivocate on that, he had five months to do it,"" Crawford said. ""He didn’t until it was politically expedient and that doesn’t ring true.""Speaking of truth, where does all of this leave us on whether David Perdue would raise taxes?Basing the statement alone on Perdue’s meeting with a newspaper editorial board takes his statements out of context. Equating revenue increases with tax hikes is a stretch that breaks upon closer examination.Perdue is far more clear, though, on support for extending sales taxes to goods and services bought online. Though the Fair Tax includes such a tax as part of its proposal, there is a separate bill that would levy the Internet sales tax in the exact way that Perdue said he supported.Taken together, we rate the claim Half True.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2gTI_bAPqM,http://media.macon.com/smedia/2014/05/12/13/19/ztMGE.So.71.mp3,http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/01/27/phil-gingrey-targets-paul-brouns-gun-giveaway-providing-glimpse-of-new-senate-strategy,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/no-biden-has-not-signed-45-capital-gains-tax-or-in/,http://cber.utk.edu/ecomm/ecom0409.pdf,http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:S.743:,http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/files/bartlett_fair_tax.pdf",,"Georgia,Taxes,Jack Kingston",,,,,

He doubled down on it, in a way, while insisting just because they found success does not mean they are out of touch.""I think I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office,"" he told host David Gregory in an interview airing June 29, 2014, on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""But I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don't, and we've got a good life, and I'm grateful for it.""Intrigued by his comment, we wanted to know if it was accurate.Nowadays, the Clintons are not known for living on modest means. A Washington Post report says Bill Clinton earned more than $100 million from speeches given in the U.S. and abroad between January 2001, when he left office, and January 2013, when Hillary Clinton left her role as Secretary of State. She reportedly draws $200,000 for each public appearance, a new talking point among pundits who oppose her potential 2016 presidential candidacy.Clinton is considered the wealthiest living president and among the top-10 all-time wealthiest, with the Clintons’ combined net worth at about $55 million, according to the website 24/7 Wall Street, which started evaluating the net worth of presidents in 2010.But to Clinton’s point, it was not always this way.Clinton’s pre-presidential wealthThe Clintons did not move into the White House with old money akin to the political dynasties of the Roosevelts, Kennedys and Bushes. And unlike nearly every other president, Clinton’s wife was the breadwinner ahead of his run for the Oval Office.Clinton sought a political career not long after graduating from Yale Law School in 1973 and marrying Hillary Rodham two years later, first winning a term as Arkansas’ attorney general in 1976 and following it up with five terms as governor.He earned $35,000 a year as governor, consistent with the lower pay of other Southern governors, as well as some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary Clinton, then a lawyer and senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992.The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a statement released a few months later, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post. Assets included big gains in their investment portfolio (reaching $387,077) and retirement plans of $180,200, and liabilities included $65,000 mortgage for a half-interest in a condo co-owned with Hillary Clinton’s parents and a $100,000 bank loan from his last governor’s race.Was Clinton counting himself separately from his wife? We don’t know for sure, because our email wasn’t returned. But that would not be consistent with how married couples are usually treated under the tax code, an expert told us.""Most net worths of individuals, presidents or otherwise, are viewed as joint net worths,"" said Barbara Perry, senior fellow and associate professor in the University of Virginia Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program. ""Most of these (presidents) did not have spouses with their own high income.""Comparing against other presidentsWhile we have a good picture of Clinton’s net worth, it is more difficult to gauge the net worths of many other presidents who served in the 20th century. The 24/7 Wall St. research is helpful but does not detail presidents’ net worth before taking office -- the crux of what we’re checking.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021We heard from several experts on presidents who said the data we need is just not available. Problems include a lack of uniform candidate financial disclosure requirements, inflation and changing national circumstances.""It’s one of those Clintonesque statements that can be true but who knows?"" said Lewis Gould, a visiting distinguished professor at Monmouth College and scholar of William McKinley.We know some presidents are not really in the conversation. Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy all came from wealthy families, while Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush all either were successful in real estate or investments, or both.Others came from a career in public service and did not have significant family wealth, including Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Woodrow Wilson.Often, people discussing the least monied presidents -- especially in the 20th century -- turn to Harry S. Truman.Truman’s money problems and bankruptcy-dodging as a result of his failed haberdashery business in the 1920s are no secret. With debts over his head, he continued to climb political ladders, first as a county judge and ultimately as U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945.Truman continued to live modestly as a senator and vice president, residing in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C., shared with his wife Bess, daughter Margaret and ailing mother-in-law. Truman’s mother-in-law, not Truman, owned the well-known Truman Home in Independence, Mo., said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and distinguished professor of history emeritus at Ohio University.Even as a U.S. senator in 1935 earning $10,000, Truman was not in a solid enough financial position to save the family farm owned by his mother, Hamby said. So even though it’s not clear what his net worth was before he became president, Hamby said, ""I find it very hard to believe that Bill Clinton was in a tighter financial situation.""Another contender, though his term straddles the 19th and 20th centuries, is William McKinley, who was assassinated six months into his second term on September 1901. Based in Canton, Ohio, McKinley practiced law before becoming Ohio governor. The economic collapse of 1893 dealt him a personal financial setback during his time as governor, as he had co-signed loans from a friend who ended up going bankrupt (his friends helped him raise the money). He took office in 1897 and left an estate of $250,000 when he died, Gould said.We also found a document through the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggesting that the 38th president took office with a relatively small net worth. The document, with a date of Oct. 29, 1973 (which would have been a year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378. That would have the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992, when adjusted for inflation.Russell Riley, co-chair of the Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program and director of the Clinton Presidential History Project, said Clinton’s claim did not strike him as much of an exaggeration, ""if an exaggeration at all.""""He may have taken it one step too far by asserting he was No. 1 on the list, but if he’s not No. 1 he’s somewhere near the top,"" Riley said.Our rulingClinton said, ""I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office.""Without a doubt, Clinton’s net worth was one of the lowest of 20th century presidents, experts told us. Whether it was the lowest is hard to say, and we could not find information to support it. There’s a good case to be made that Truman entered the White House with a (albeit unknown) smaller net worth.There’s not enough evidence to prove Clinton correct, but he is at least right in his larger point: He did not enter the White House with the wealth of many of his contemporaries.On balance, we rate his claim Half True.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-clintons-went-from-dead-broke-to-rich-bill-earned-1049-million-for-speeches/2014/06/26/8fa0b372-fd3a-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/10-richest-us-presidents-f1C7100851,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/02/15/10-richest-presidents/5514567/,http://247wallst.com/banking-finance/2010/05/17/the-net-worth-of-the-american-presidents-washington-to-obama/,http://www.roselawfirm.com/,https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/05/us/1992-campaign-personal-finances-wealthy-investment-family-big-help-clinton.html,http://247wallst.com/banking-finance/2010/05/17/the-net-worth-of-the-american-presidents-washington-to-obama/4/,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://www.nps.gov/hstr/index.htm,http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/document/factbook/taxes.htm",,"History,Wealth,PunditFact,Bill Clinton",,,,,

Rick Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances.""",,politifact,,"Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson passed up the chance to run for governor against Rick Scott this year, but that doesn’t mean he’s done attacking the Republican incumbent.Nelson went on the offensive against the governor, with a page on his website entitled ""The public has a right to know,"" asking for people to sign up to protest Scott’s alleged lack of transparency. The message also went out via email.""Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida’s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets,"" Nelson said in an email sent June 13, 2014. ""Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this.""Did Scott really sign a bill making it easier to hide assets from his financial disclosure statements? We’ll take a look at Florida law so you won’t be coming into this debate blind.Trusting disclosuresWhile we didn’t hear back from Nelson’s office about clarifying this attack, it’s pretty obvious he’s referring to Senate Bill 2, a 2013 law unanimously passed by the Legislature that allowed state elected officials to establish a blind trust for their financial holdings and investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest.In essence, a blind trust is when someone turns over their portfolio to a third-party trustee, who then buys and sells stocks, bonds and other assets without the owner’s knowledge.Nelson is right that Scott signed SB 2 into law in May 2013. And yes, Scott is the only elected official in the state to use this law to put assets into a blind trust. The question is whether the law makes it easier to hide assets from the public.By definition, a blind trust makes it easier for a candidate to not disclose the investments that person owns. A blind trust allows Scott to declare a lump sum net worth without having to disclose the value of his vast portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, some of which are regulated by the state and whose value could be directly affected by Scott's policies.But under SB 2, politicians must first disclose the assets they put into the blind trust. Scott did this in 2011, before the law was in place. It’s only after those assets are in the trust that they are not available to the public -- or the official who put them there.Other officials have used a blind trust in the past. Alex Sink did it in December 2006 after she became the state’s chief financial officer, an issue that became a somewhat contentious element of her failed gubernatorial run against Scott in 2010, because she voted for a new bond sale process that included her former employer, Bank of America. Sink created a blind trust on her own, without an ethics law addressing it.Scott did the same thing after being elected as governor, disclosing all his investments in 2010, then forming his own blind trust in 2011 to avoid a conflict of interest, he said.For years, the state ethics commission advised the Legislature to pass a law allowing blind trusts to deal with official conflicts of interest. In 2013, both the House and Senate unanimously passed SB 2. The bill regulated blind trusts and set the powers and duties of appointed trustees, including prohibiting them from telling their clients, such as Scott, what assets are bought or sold. These rules had not been in place prior to the bill’s passage, leaving blind trusts unregulated by the state.Jan Jacobowitz, director of the Professional Responsibility & Ethics Program at the University of Miami, says the problem in Scott’s case is more who is managing the portfolio.In this case, the custodian of Scott’s $72 million portfolio is Alan Lee Bazaar, the chief executive of a New York investment advisory firm with ties to Scott’s business dealings.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.By Chris Nichols • February 2, 2021""If you sort of have an insider managing your blind trust, it doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in the people,"" Jacobowitz said.While the state law provides some safeguards against conflicts of interest drawn from similar federal regulations, there were more than a dozen federal guidelines the state’s law didn’t incorporate (a point reported by the website the BrowardBulldog.org). These included making trust agreements public, allowing the ethics commission to remove trustees for misconduct and requiring periodic trust performance reports to the commission.Another problem with blind trusts is the while the owner may not manage the holdings, they still know what they own when they put those investments in the trust.""If what you’re putting in has a conflict of interest, then there’s a problem. You still know what’s in it,"" Jacobowitz said.In May, former Democratic legislator and constitutional law expert Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte filed a lawsuit brought by Jim Apthorp, challenging the constitutionality of the law. Apthorp, a Democrat and former chief of staff to the late Gov. Reubin Askew, said the law violated state requirements for financial disclosure. As of June 20, the court is weighing that claim.On June 16, Scott disclosed all of his financials in order to run for governor. In addition to his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns (he and wife Ann Scott filed for an extension on their 2013 return), the governor ended his blind trust and revealed all the investments in his candidacy filing. That move wasn’t required by the 2013 law, which only says he must disclose the value of the blind trust, not its contents.Scott's net worth rose from $83.8 million in 2012 to $132.7 million last year, an increase of more than half, according to his financial disclosures. When he first ran in 2010, his net worth was a reported $218.6 million. He bankrolled his own campaign and has kept a campaign promise not to draw a salary from the state.One of the notable things missing from Scott’s investments was any interest in French oil services company Schlumberger Ltd., which is involved in Everglades drilling. Scott had a $135,000 investment in 2011 when he formed the trust, but the stake was gone in his June 16 disclosure. The former holding has since drawn an ethics complaint.After filing his paperwork, Scott put the investments into a new blind trust.Our rulingNelson said ""Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances.""In terms of historical context and content of the Senate Bill 2, that part is true. Blind trusts do let officials shield financial holdings from disclosure requirements, and Florida law now allows officials to use those trusts.The broader implication of Nelson’s statement is that Scott is being dishonest about what he owns, and that it affects his ability to govern without creating conflicts of interest. After Nelson made the statement, Scott ended the trust and disclosed all his holdings, but he was following a law both recommended by the state ethics commission and approved unanimously by the Legislature.That law requires any official to disclose the assets being put into the trust before being turned over to a manager. There is debate over the law’s rules regarding choosing that manager and whether assets in that portfolio may present a conflict of interest. What goes into the trust would be publicly disclosed, however, while how it is managed afterward would not.That’s not the same as hiding assets from voters. In this case, Scott ended the trust to disclose the portfolio’s contents, anyway.Nelson implied the blind trust law makes it easier to hide personal assets. They may be hidden, but only after they are listed and turned over to a trustee.We rate the statement Half True.","http://nelsonforsenate.com/right-to-know?utm_source=sp6660677&utm_medium=email&sc=sp6660677&refcode=sp6660677&ta=0,https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0002/?Tab=BillHistory,https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0002/BillText/er/PDF,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-funneled-770k-her-former/,http://www.browardbulldog.org/2014/03/gov-scott-chose-a-familiar-face-to-manage-his-72-million-blind-trust/,/personalities/blog-posting/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/blog-posting/no-facebook-didnt-try-shut-down-gavin-newsom-recal/,http://www.browardbulldog.org/2014/04/gov-scotts-blind-trust-deviates-from-u-s-model-florida-law-omits-federal-safeguards/,http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/scott-crist-both-getting-richer--candidate-disclosures-show/2184643,http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/scotts-stake-in-oil-company-tied-to-collier-drilling-riles/2184342,http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/ethics-complaint-filed-on-scotts-stake-in-oil-drilling-company/2184775",,"Elections,Transparency,Florida,Bill Nelson",,,,,

Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations, but the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties.The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion.Scott’s depositionScott gave a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.""But that deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation.The deposition was part of a civil case in which Nevada Communications Corp. alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract.Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. (The records of Scott’s deposition were distributed to reporters by Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum in 2010.)The deposition shows that Scott repeatedly refused to answer questions. Scott's lawyer first interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking simply if Scott was employed.""Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today,"" Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. ""Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself.""Scott then went on to read the same answer, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- ""Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.""Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021The Democrats’ ad doesn’t tell viewers that the deposition was part of a civil case unrelated to the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation. However, Scott’s reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment was as a result of the criminal investigations, his lawyer said.What about other depositions?The Democrats’ ad makes a reference to multiple lawsuits: ""And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times.""""The Nevada Communications Corp. case is the only lawsuit where Scott took the Fifth 75 times,"" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida. (The ad includes video footage of Scott from a 1995 case -- not the 2000 case which is the focus of the ad.)Karp pointed to a 2010 Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times article which stated that Scott gave ""murky testimony"" in a series of depositions.An example: In a 1997 deposition when he was asked about an apparent agreement he made with a Texas doctor, Scott said: ""I don't know what your definition or anybody's definition of an ‘agreement’ is, or an ‘offer’ is, or ‘promise’ is.''What he ‘might’ admit to if he had testifiedThe ad states that ""Scott refused to answer questions because, if he had, he might admit to committing a crime."" We can’t fact-check what Scott might or might not have admitted, but it’s worth noting a few things about the Fifth Amendment.The Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956.In a civil case, things get a little murkier, and judges or juries can infer what they want from  a person using the Fifth Amendment.""The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' "" George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact Florida in 2010. ""However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason.""Scott’s responseDuring the Univision debate in October 2010, Scott was asked about the deposition:""With regard to that deposition, that was years after I left HCA. It was just, you know, all the same trial lawyers that are supporting my opponent, they were doing a fishing expedition, and they sat there, you know, it was a case I knew nothing about, I was not involved, I was not a defendant. So to stop the fishing expedition I just didn't do it.""As for the case itself, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times in 2010, ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader.""Our rulingThe Florida Democratic Party’s TV ad states that when Rick Scott ""was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times.""We have two quibbles with the ad: the Democrats don't specify that the deposition was from a civil business case -- not the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation into Columbia/HCA. However, Scott used the Fifth Amendment due to that federal investigation.Also, the ad refers to multiple lawsuits -- Scott was deposed in separate lawsuits, but he took the Fifth Amendment 75 times in only one of them.We rate this claim Mostly True.

Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently charged President Barack Obama with freeing thousands of convicted murderers, kidnappers, rapists and other criminals before deportation.Obama's ""lax immigration policies continue to put the lives of Americans at risk,"" Smith said in his letter in the May 31, 2014, San Antonio Express-News.""Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions,"" Smith wrote. ""The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crimes. This would be considered the worst prison break in American history, except it was approved by the president and enabled by immigration officials.""Did Obama deliver the equivalent of a giant prison break?By email, Smith spokeswoman Kim Smith Hicks told us Rep. Smith relied on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. The report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings,"" according to an ICE document obtained by the center. By phone, the report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, told us the document came to the center from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries to the agency.The center included a chart in its report showing more than 88,000 convictions including 116 homicide convictions and more than 300 sexual assault offenses. But the biggest cluster of convictions (17,000-plus) were for traffic offenses, followed by more than 15,000 drunk-driving violations. The released individuals accumulated about 9,200 ""dangerous drugs"" convictions, according to the chart, and 5,000 larceny offenses.The document didn’t itemize reasons for the releases. But the center’s report said individuals were subsequently subject to little to no government supervision, though an unknown number were required to check in by telephone or to wear tracking devices. The center said less than 3,000 were released due to a 2001 Supreme Court decision preventing ICE from indefinitely detaining certain individuals whose countries will not take them back.Vaughan told us all the convicts were let go from ICE-run facilities or other jails where housing had been federally paid for.Separately, a May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story pointed out the released individuals had all completed their criminal jail sentences, according to ICE. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while their cases were pending.And why were the detainees let go?Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021The story quoted an ICE spokeswoman, Barbara Gonzalez, as saying that in many of the tallied cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. ""The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report,"" Gonzalez said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported.We reached out to Gonzalez, hearing back from Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, who emailed us similar information. ""Convicted criminals come into the agency’s custody to undergo removal proceedings after they have already satisfied the terms of their criminal sentence,"" Rusnok said. ""In many of the releases in 2013, ICE was required by law to release the individuals from custody, pursuant to decisions by the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Once in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision, or bond.""Rusnok continued: ""The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report. For example, mandatory releases account for over 72% of the homicides listed."" He added: ""Others, typically those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security.""The Obama administration has asked Congress to fund fewer so-called detention beds in ICE facilities than before, we noted in a June 2013 fact check. An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article summed up: ""Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported."" That story quoted then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believed it could keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings.By email, the center’s Vaughan ultimately called Smith’s recent statement ""completely factual and correct.""Earlier, Vaughan told us she saw little import to the released individuals reportedly fulfilling prison sentences due to their criminal convictions before their immigration cases were taken up. No information has been released, she said, about how many of the individuals were released under personal recognizance or on bonds, both of which she described as tantamount to no post-release supervision.  Reminded of ICE saying 72 percent of the individuals convicted of murder were let go under a court’s direction, Vaughan said that means 28 percent were released at the government’s discretion.Released individuals might still face deportation, Vaughan said, but she’s doubtful many will show up for final decisions. She said the center has separately calculated that some three in four ICE detainees released while their immigration cases are pending fail to show up to finish the cases.Our rulingSmith wrote: ""Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions.

So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released?The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light.And that’s what happened.The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants.But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference.This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released.""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study).""Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities.A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown.Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft.There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant.The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense.But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal.Our rulingBoehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants.That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced.But despite these serious flaws, Boehner used the numbers anyway.

Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president.Saying Texas employs an ""all-of-the-above energy strategy"" tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: ""Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.""62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterback’s call before the snap.We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally?A 2010 fact checkPerry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the ""Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" He’d earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama.Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources.Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts  — in particular, vehicle emission regulations  — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations.As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers.EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard.Figures hold upAs in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perry’s statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perry’s analysis holds up.Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied.Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA.Let’s recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx.Ozone down 23 percentAccording to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call ""fourth-high"" ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.)A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014)NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percentIn the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014)Sierra Club stresses  federal roleFor another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perry’s figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement.Carman, director of the club’s Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a ""severe"" ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says.By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by ""lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and"" Dallas-Fort Worth ""with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems.""A ""comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year,"" Carman said, ""while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record.""Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry weren’t entirely due to federal oversight. By email,  he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power.Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perry’s statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999.Our rulingPerry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced ""harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.""Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perry’s 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perry’s declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didn’t make the gains in isolation.We rate the claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

""It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash.""Does Multnomah County have 90,000 residents who are unemployed or underemployed? We checked.The analysis:We contacted Francesconi’s campaign and asked about the statistic. They sent an email containing several sources, including the annual and quarterly reports of a nonprofit agency that tracks employment data and a link to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics table showing ""underutilized"" labor for every state.However, the crux of his claim was contained in a news article that put county unemployment at 91,600 as of March 2013. We checked that by calling Amy Vander Vliet, a regional economist with the Oregon Employment Department. Her department is responsible for compiling and publishing the state’s official employment numbers. The correct figure for Multnomah County unemployment at the time Francesconi’s campaign published its claim, she said, is 27,800.The 91,600 figure, she said, appears to come from a category labeled ""Portland Metro"" unemployment in a report issued by Worksystems, a nonprofit agency that deals with employment in Multnomah and Washington counties. The greater Portland metro area, for the agency’s reporting purposes, is comprised of seven counties, including Multnomah.We then checked the campaign’s other sources -- Worksystems’ annual State of the Workforce and its quarterly report, issued in October 2013.We checked both. The annual report did not mention ""underemployment."" Vander Vliet verified that.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021The quarterly report, which included data through the end of September 2013, said a combined 68,000 people in Washington and Multnomah counties were underemployed as of that time.Vander Vliet said she could not vouch for the figure because her department doesn’t provide county-by-county information tracking underemployment.We called Rick McKay, senior project manager at Worksystems, who came up with the 68,000 figure. He said it’s based on a sampling of telephone interviews his agency conducts. ""It’s a back-of-the-envelope kind of number,"" he said. ""But it’s somewhere in that neighborhood.""McKay estimated that about 60 percent of the 68,000 underemployed people live in Multnomah County. That would put the figure at 40,800.Clearly, that number isn’t statistically valid, but if added to the 27,800 people who are unemployed in the county, we get 68,600 people who are either unemployed or underemployed in Multnomah County. That’s considerably shy of the 90,000 figure on Francesconi’s campaign website.We asked the campaign about the discrepancy and received in reply a spreadsheet showing the number of people living below the federal poverty line in every county in the country. The numbers, taken from federal statistics, put the figure at 136,065 for Multnomah County.However, those numbers don’t take into account that many of those people, even if at or near the federal poverty level, are employed. In addition, federal poverty statistics have nothing to do with any of the sources the campaign originally provided.Our ruling:Jim Francesconi, now running for Multnomah County chair, says on his campaign website that 90,000 people in the county are either unemployed or underemployed in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash.His campaign, when asked, pointed to several sources to justify the number. One source, which the campaign could have verified, gave an incorrect figure for the number of unemployed workers in the county.Another, contrary to what the campaign asserted, made no mention of underemployed workers. A third cited a figure for underemployment, but the person who compiled the figure acknowledged it was an ""estimate on an estimate.""Taking that estimate and adding it to the number of unemployed in the county gives us a figure of 68,600 -- a lot, obviously, but far short of the 90,000 listed by Francesconi.We rate the claim False.","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Oregon,Economy,Jobs,Jim Francesconi",,,,,

That was a very strange thing to grasp. 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping records.""Castro continued: ""Harry Truman in the 1940s campaigned against a ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ and that ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ passed over 900 bills.

The chart indicates that through late December 2013, the 113th Congress had passed 72 measures into law.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama’s health care law.The ad, released in April, proclaims, ""Health care premiums up 90 percent in New Hampshire.""  New Hampshire residents may have heard this claim before. Earlier this month, the New Hampshire GOP said in a press release that ""health care premiums are ‘skyrocketing’ and have increased 90 percent in New Hampshire because of ObamaCare."" The release went on to say that ""ObamaCare is an unmitigated disaster that is raising the cost of health care for the middle class.""Nearly identical claims were tweeted by GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn and by former Sen. Scott Brown, who is running against Shaheen.A 90 percent increase seemed like a lot, so we decided to check the numbers.The claim stems from a blog post at Forbes.com, which was based on a study by the investment firm Morgan Stanley.The Morgan Stanley study takes a look at ""individual and small-group rate increases."" Respectively, those categories of health insurance refer to plans purchased by individuals on their own, and by smaller companies. A third category of private insurance -- large-group plans -- were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance.So, the first thing to note is that while the study only looked at a subset of all health care premiums, the ad’s claim doesn’t make that distinction.Another issue: Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. This is because existing individual- and small-group policies were less likely to include all of the requirements enacted under Obama’s law, such as free preventive care. To make up for those shortfalls in benefits, these plans were expected to raise premiums.In fact, while the Morgan Stanley study pegged individual plan increases at 90 percent in New Hampshire, it said that small group plans increased by 15 percent. In other words, the ad cherry-picked the bigger increase statistic and ignored the other.Then there’s the methodology of the study itself. Morgan Stanley surveyed 148 insurance brokers nationally, with only one being from New Hampshire, as reported by Factcheck.org.That’s too small a sample to produce a reliable statistic, experts say.Using just one respondent is like ""calling one person up on the phone and asking their opinion,"" Robert Santos, chief methodologist at the Urban Institute told FactCheck.org.The survey also reported a 100 percent increase in Delaware’s health care premiums, where only one broker was surveyed.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021In fact, the statistic caught the eye of officials at the New Hampshire Department of Insurance, who asked to see the Morgan Stanley survey. They were told ""it was proprietary and confidential,"" according to department spokeswoman Danielle Barrick.""We don’t understand how Morgan Stanley is able to generalize what’s going on in the New Hampshire market based on talking to 158 brokers nationally,"" Barrick said.We reached out to Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire, who stood by the claim.""Forbes has not updated, corrected or retracted its original story,"" AFP-NH state director Greg Moore said. "" Accordingly, one must assume that the news outlet is standing by its work.""Unfortunately, hard data on any premium increases since people were allowed to sign up for the Affordable Care Act does not exist, the insurance department said.However, the Morgan Stanley study, if it were reliable, would suggest premium increases far beyond projections in an earlier study by the state insurance department. That study said the Affordable Care Act would increase premiums on the individual market by about 30 percent.And costs would actually fall, not rise, once federal subsidies are taken into consideration. Income-based subsidies are available to consumers who purchased health care through the marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. After subsidies, the study projected, individual premiums would decrease by 9 percent. Premiums, however, were projected to go up by a ""significant"" amount for people without subsidies.By the end of February, 22,000 Granite Staters had purchased a plan through the marketplace. The department said that 83 percent of consumers with marketplace plans have been eligible for financial assistance.As for ""small group"" plans, their increases were expected to range between 1 percent and 3 percent.Finally, we asked the Department of Insurance whether they thought it was possible for an individual in New Hampshire to experience a 90 percent rise in their own premiums. Barrick said it’s hard to know for sure, since premiums vary based on age, tobacco use and the number of people covered under a certain policy.The department said it’s possible for a resident -- especially someone older, who smokes and earns too much to get a federal subsidy -- to move from an employer-sponsored policy with a low employee-contribution rate to a policy in the individual market and find themselves ""paying much more.""""However,"" Barrick added, ""the fact that the person is paying more does not mean premiums went up in the aggregate"" for all New Hampshire residents, as the ad says.Our rulingAmericans for Prosperity said that health care premiums are ""up 90 percent in New Hampshire.""The claim cited a Morgan Stanley report that based its New Hampshire numbers on data from just one insurance broker in the state. Experts say that’s far too small a sample to say anything definitive about what’s happening to premiums in the state.It’s possible for some individuals, given the wrong combination of income and health factors, could see premium increases of 90 percent. But that’s a far cry from saying that such increases are typical in the state.This statement is not accurate.

By 2016, the levy grows to $2,085 per family or 2.5 percent of household income -- whichever is greater. Certain tax filers facing financial hardship and other situations are exempt.Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, told us in an e-mail that ""Ed never supported the individual mandate.""Gillespie made a similar statement to the Washington Examiner last December, before he announced his candidacy. ""If I run against Sen. Warner, my critique of Obamacare will be consistent with my past positions in opposition to an individual mandate and too much government intrusion in our health care sector,"" he said.But Democrats point to a 2006 book passage in which Gillespie wrote that health care reforms should ensure that uncovered adults gain health care insurance so they won’t remain ""free riders"" who get care at others’ expense.""A more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so,"" Gillespie wrote. ""One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance. Annual filers would have to attest that they have some form of health coverage or else the ‘standard deduction’ on their income tax would be cut in half.""Right after this passage, Gillespie discussed another way to ensure all adults provide for their own health care.""Another approach would be the creation of tax-free Health Savings Accounts that would be refunded after a certain period for any use,"" he wrote. ""If after seven years, an individual didn’t use his HSA funds for health care, the money would be treated like an income tax refund. The inducement of tax-free savings for those who are healthy would provide an incentive for more people to obtain insurance coverage."".We twice asked Gillespie’s campaign why his suggestion to cut the standard deduction for uninsured people should not be considered support for a mandate. Logan did not provide a direct answer, saying Gillespie was writing about ""various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time.""Logan also pointed us to an op-ed earlier this month in Forbes in which Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, said the passage In Gillespie’s book amounts to an ""anti-mandate approach.""Matthews told us he ""assumed"" that Gillespie, in his 2006 book, was endorsing an unsuccessful proposal President George W. Bush made one year later offering tax breaks to insured households. Bush’s ""carrot"" approach sought voluntary compliance; it did not mandate the purchase of health insurance, but would have rewarded most people who had coverage. That’s different from Obama’s ""stick"" approach of insisting people obtain coverage or face tax penalties.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021But Matthews added that the Gillespie campaign has never told him his assumption is correct and that Gillespie’s language in the book is unclear.Logan also pointed to a column from the conservative National Review magazine which said ""some of the language (‘ensure,’ compliance’) sounds pro-mandate, but the actual policies described strongly resemble the proposals of the Bush administration and of Paul Ryan, which very few conservatives have described as the equivalent of a mandate.""We spoke to two health care experts who had a different take on Gillespie’s prose.  Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, told us the policy Gillespie described is ""the functional equivalent of an individual mandate without using the words mandate and fine.""""Absolutely, that’s an individual mandate,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, after reading Gillespie’s passage.Tanner said the passage sounds like an endorsement Massachusetts health care reforms that then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a few months before Gillespie’s book was published. The law imposed tax penalties on state residents who could afford insurance and refused to buy it.In November 2006, a few months after his book was released, Gillespie specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan.""You see Mitt Romney in Massachusetts is taking some steps toward individual requirements for people to carry their own insurance. I think the party is probably open to that kind of approach,"" Gillespie told C-SPAN. ""Others are proposing small business health plans and greater transparency and putting the consumer closer in touch with the health care expenditure. I think that’s a good direction.""Logan, Gillespie’s spokesman, said the interview establishes his boss’s mindset: While Gillespie opined that the GOP might be open to an individual mandate, Gillespie added he personally thought a ""good direction"" was to pursue a different approach.In ensuing years, Gillespie emerged as a steadfast opponent to the individual mandate in Obamacare. In November 2009, he told ABC News that the health reform bill under consideration was a ""monstrosity"" in part because of ""the mandates in it.""As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, the individual mandate was discussed in Republican circles more than 15 years before Obamacare even existed. In 1993 some Republican senators signed onto a bill that would have required everyone to buy insurance. The legislation was an alternative to then President Bill Clinton’s failed health care reform plan that required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated insurers and health care providers.Our rulingDemocrats said Gillespie’s book ""promoted an individual mandate.""Gillespie’s 2006 memoir states that one way of reforming health care is to require people to carry insurance or have their standard tax deduction cut in half. That fits the definition of an individual mandate. Gillespie’s campaign denies this is the case, but declines to provide a clear explanation.It should be noted that Gillespie offered tax consequences as one possibility for reforming health care. His book suggested Health Savings Account as another way to ensure adults get coverage.Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines ""promote"" as ""to help bring about"" something. Although it may not have been Gillespie’s intention, his unclear book passage can be easily interpreted as advancing the idea of individual mandates during a formative time for health policy.So we rate the Democrats’ claim Mostly True.","https://www.vademocrats.org/news/press/romneycare-vs-gillespiecare-whats-difference,http://washingtonexaminer.com/health-care-could-be-obstacle-for-republican-ed-gillespie-if-he-enters-virginia-senate-race/article/2540959,https://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillmatthews/2014/04/01/health-insurance-mandates-so-unpopular-democrats-are-accusing-republicans-of-supporting-it/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/no-biden-has-not-signed-45-capital-gains-tax-or-in/,http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295428/ed-gillespie-i-have-never-advocated-individual-mandate-ramesh-ponnuru,https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/Politics/transcript-senior-wh-adviser-valerie-jarrett/story?id=8964986&page=16,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/cenk-uygur/hatch-once-supported-individual-mandate-said-cenk-/",,"Medicaid,Taxes,Virginia,Democratic Party of Virginia",,,,,

We found mid-year population estimates dating back to 1900.The lowest point was from mid 1917 to mid 1918, when the U.S. began sending troops to Europe for World War I and the nation’s population actually decreased by 60,000, or 0.06 percent. That’s the only time since the start of the last century when the number of people decreased.Save that year, population growth hovered between 1 and 2 percent until 1931 when, in the teeth of the Great Depression, it dropped to 0.78 percent. It bottomed at 0.59 percent during the 12-month period beginning in July 1933. U.S. Population growth did not climb above 0.8 percent until mid 1939.From there U.S. population growth increased gradually through the ‘40s, peaking at 2.05 percent in 1950, and staying above 1 percent until 1973. It generally hovered at slightly below 1 percent through 2009.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021In 2010, as the nation was slowly emerging from recession, the growth rate plummeted to 0.84 percent, followed by 0.72 in 2011, 0.74 in 2012 and 0.72 in 2013.Indeed, the last four years mark the four lowest points of population growth since the Great Depression. And the growth rates of 2011 and 2013 are at the bottom of the time span.William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institute, says U.S. population growth is closely tied to the economy.

That’s the lowest birth rate in records dating back to 1940. Women in that age group had 3.95 million babies in 2012, a drop of 368,000 births from five years earlier.Immigration has slowed since the start of this century, but has been rebounding in recent years. In 2001, there was a net increase of nearly 1.2 million immigrants in the U.S. and that dropped to 726,000 in 2009.

Look to the partisan bickering between Democratic strategist James Carville and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on ABC’s This Week to see what we mean.  Carville said Sebelius’ departure doesn’t change the fact that the law is working. ""You know what? Y’all said it was gonna collapse. You said no one would sign up. You said it was going to cost part-time jobs -- """"It’s costing 2 million jobs,"" Ingraham jumped in, attributing the figure to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Carville kept talking: ""You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of that has happened. Get over it. It’s working. It’s gonna work.""PunditFact checks out Carville’s point on risk corridors here. In this fact-check, we focused on Ingraham’s point about a CBO report that analyzed the health care law’s long-term effect on employment.Fact-checkers have heard Obamacare critics misrepresent the report many, many times. When the CBO released this report in February, House Speaker John Boehner and Fox News host Gretchen Carlson jumped out in front with some poor interpretations of this paragraph from CBO:""The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" the nonpartisan research service wrote.At first blush, that may seem to match what Ingraham said about the law ""costing 2 million jobs."" But the losses CBO projected aren’t exactly full-time jobs, and they aren’t driven by employers laying off employees.Essentially, some workers are expected to voluntarily dial back their hours.Or as the CBO put it: ""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor.""It’s an important distinction. CBO estimated that millions of Americans will probably decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more available by offering subsidies for some to obtain insurance and expanding Medicaid eligibility in some states.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021CBO found the tax penalties imposed on employers that do not provide insurance to their workers and new taxes on labor income would have a smaller effect on the labor market than the Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies.Just as important, CBO’s 2 million ""full-time-equivalent workers"" figure is not a dressed-up word for 2 million full-time jobs. CBO did not break down how many full-time jobs would be reduced under the law versus employees simply working fewer hours, dropping a separate part-time job, or leaving the workforce.""Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million,"" the report states. ""At the same time, more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree because of the ACA, even though many of them will not leave the labor force entirely.""None of this is to say the health care law is not affecting the job market.Analysts expect the country’s labor force participation rate to fall over the coming decade, and some people may not like the idea that people would work fewer hours because they can obtain government-subsidized insurance.""Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity,"" Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, told us in February.Lastly, researchers said the law’s biggest effects on employment would happen after 2016, when more provisions have taken effect, so the estimate is not a present-day reflection as Ingraham makes it sound. CBO researchers also note total employment and compensation will increase over the next decade, but ""that increase will be smaller than it would have been in the absence of the ACA.""Our rulingWe are fact-checkers, not fortune-tellers. We’ll steer clear of declaring the health care law a success or failure. For one, it’s simply too soon to tell.It is possible to say, however, whether pundits are accurately summarizing projections from nonpartisan government analysts about the law. And when Ingraham cited CBO for her claim that the law ""is costing 2 million jobs,"" she glazed over a swath of important details.Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.(Update April 15: Ingraham responded to our ruling on her April 14, radio show, saying: ""The economy is affected when fewer people work. This is a real effect on the real American economy. So you can argue about how you interpret the number of jobs lost. You can say that's a good thing. ... Democrats love when people aren't working. ...That does not change the underlying fact that jobs will be lost because of Obamacare. PolitiFact and the Democrats think it's a good idea to add to those terrible (jobs) numbers with more people not working. And you're going to fact-check me? Fact-check this. Fact-check yourself. You are so untethered to reality and the real world for most people.

On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said the effort should start at sign-up.""When people enlist in the military, there is a physical check but there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service,"" McCaul. ""I think this will be a good idea to, No. 1, screen out individuals that may have mental illness problems. No. 2, have a baseline so that when they return home, we can compare that to where they are when they come back.""We were unfamiliar with the process men and women go through to enlist and imagine McCaul’s claim about mental health evaluations caught the attention of viewers as well. So we decided to check it out.No formal processOfficials have not yet identified a motive that caused Army Spec. Ivan A. Lopez to open fire at the Fort Hood base, killing three and injuring more than a dozen. Lopez was being treated for depression and was screened for post traumatic stress disorder, though Army officials have said mental health was ""not the direct precipitating factor"" in the shooting.McCaul’s office pointed us to legislation introduced by Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Penn. on March 27, 2014 -- coincidentally, just days before the shooting -- called the ""Medical Evaluation Parity for Service Members Act."" The bill would require a medical evaluation before an individual enlists in the armed forces.According to the legislation, ""Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health.""Speaking in favor of the bill, retired Army colonel and director of legislation for the National Guard Association of the United States Peter Duff said, ""Not having a baseline is a neglectful disservice to our military members and veterans who risk their lives for our nation.""The bill has the support from various military and veteran organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Officers Association, Reserve Enlisted Association, Association of the U.S. Navy, National Military Family Association and Military Officers Association of America, as well as the American Psychological Association.A mental health examination is not listed in a description of the application procedure on the United State Military Entrance Processing Command website or in the Military Entrance Processing Station regulations.That’s all pretty strong evidence that no separate examination for identifying mental health disorders in enlistees exists, at least not in a similar form as the physical new recruits must go through.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021What does exist?But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront?In addition to an aptitude test, as part of the initial screening, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history.Col. Rebecca I. Porter, chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Army’s Surgeon General, told the Washington Post that the application process ""includes a review of whatever medical records we have available, as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information. We look for past diagnoses or past treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems.""Porter said a past suicide attempt, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches.But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems. Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted.""People who want to come into the Army are no fools,"" Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a former chief psychiatrist in the Army, told the Los Angeles Times. ""They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt, you're probably not going to get in.""A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the U.S. Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted.Once enlisted, however, service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment.""We have a series of evaluation of any soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman who's deployed prior to their deployment,"" Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR. ""They have access to mental health and physical health care providers, as well, while they're on deployment. And when they return from deployment, within 30 days of their being redeployed, they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down-range, which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station.""Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer. ""If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldier’s behavior, he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic,"" Porter said in her Post interview. ""Or if a commander had questions about a soldier’s fitness for duty, they could do a command-directed mental health evaluation, in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander.""Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful. Schoomaker, a surgeon in the Army until 2012, recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process ""would just lead to driving the problems further underground.""Our rulingMcCaul said ""there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service."" Compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit’s mental health. While the armed services review past medical records for a history of mental health issues and allow for the applicant to offer any additional information, it has not prevented a sizable number of individuals with mental health problems from acceptance.Lawmakers and military officials can debate what steps should or should not be taken, but we can’t find any flaw in McCaul’s characterization of the current procedures.

So when Dan Abrams and Nancy Grace got into a spat over the Oscar Pistorius murder trial on Good Morning America, we had to dig in.Pistorius, the paralympian known as ""Blade Runner,"" is accused of murdering his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, by shooting her with expanding bullets through a bathroom door in his home on Feb. 14, 2013. He admitted to shooting her but says it was an accident because he thought she was an intruder. The prosecution presented its case in March, and Pistorius is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes.Abrams and Grace, who are both attorneys, agreed the prosecution brought a strong case for a murder conviction. But they had sharply different takes on whether there was enough evidence to prove the killing of Steenkamp was premeditated.Abrams said, ""I have not heard a single piece of evidence in this case which says this was a premeditated murder.""""Premeditation requires planning, it requires thought beforehand. That’s very different from just an intentional murder. He’s charged with premeditated murder here. Look, the reality is this judge could decide intentional murder, that’s still a conviction on murder, it’s a slightly lesser sentence than premeditated. But I don’t know why they’ve pursued a premeditated murder case unless there’s some other evidence that’s going to be presented in this case.""Grace’s turn. ""Well, I know why. And it’s a very common misunderstanding about premeditation. Yes, it is intent. Yes, it is planning. But premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye. That quickly.""There was some overtalk, and Grace continued: ""He came and got the gun out of the holster from under her side of the bed. He had to see, he was on his stumps, which he lied about, he had to see she wasn’t in the bed. He then walked into the bathroom and started firing. And they had had an argument. And the argument as you pointed out earlier, Dan, shows motive for anger. And just because you’re angry that does not denigrate premeditation.""Abrams responded: ""But that’s just a misunderstanding of the law. The bottom line is what Nancy is talking about, about what you can form in an instant, is intent. You can create the intent to commit murder in an instant. You cannot create the intent to create premeditation in an instant. And in fact there’s a case in South Africa...""Grace cut in: ""The intent to create premeditation? Premeditation is simply planning, and you can plan in a moment of minutes.""""Whoa, so now we’re minutes?"" Abrams said. ""A moment ago you were saying it’s seconds. So the bottom line is premeditation takes time. You have to plan it out.""Grace: ""Yeah, well, it can be seconds according to the law. Go read your law book. Come back to me after you’ve tried a couple murders.""Sorry for the whole transcript, but it’s a fun read. And it’s all crucial to our fact-check. Disses aside, a reader asked if Grace was right that premeditation could occur in ""the twinkling of an eye.""In South Africa, the site of Pistorius’ trial, the answer could mean the difference between Pistorius spending the rest of his life in prison or getting a lighter sentence. (There’s no death penalty, or juries, in South Africa.)To our question here, legal analysts we consulted said deciding to kill someone in the moments before a murder can be considered premeditation in many American jurisdictions. But that does not necessarily apply in the backdrop of Grace’s statement, South African court, where experts point to case law that suggests premeditation requires more of a plan.Could it happen in the U.S.?Pistorius is charged with murder, and prosecutors want to prove it was premeditated because that warrants the stiffest penalty under South African law, life in prison. The legal analysts on TV were essentially arguing about what kind of sentence he will get.Grace, via a HLN spokeswoman, pointed to case law to back up her point involving U.S. Supreme Court decisions and state Supreme Court appeals of murder cases in Montana and Georgia, which say things like ""premeditation may be formed momentarily"" and ""malice aforethought can be formed instantly.""And American law experts say she has a valid point that just seconds could qualify as premeditated in some states. Planning in many American definitions does not require much time and is basically the opposite of impulse, which usually leads to second-degree murder, said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor and director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. But it’s not uniform.""The drafters of the American Model Penal Code strongly urged the elimination of the premeditation/intent distinction, but few states follow that guidance,"" Weisberg said.So whether premeditation can occur in an instant in America is nuanced depending upon the jurisdiction.""That might be true in a Georgia court where she practiced law, but it’s not true in a Florida court,"" said Charles Rose, a professor at Stetson University College of Law.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021South Africa law ≠ U.S. lawThe more important question: Could it be true in South Africa?What counts as premeditation is an unsettled area of law decided on a case by case basis, said Kelly Phelps, a University of Cape Town Faculty of Law senior lecturer. Still, jurisprudence suggests it takes time.""What is clear is that crimes of passion in the heat of the moment will not be premeditation,"" Phelps said. ""It is true that as long as a clear thought is formed and executed, even in a few minutes, this could in theory be premeditation, but not if the killing happen on the spur of the moment out of rage.""Some types of murder that would be considered premeditated in the U.S. would not be considered premeditated in South Africa, said Bob Dekle, a retired assistant state attorney who teaches the prosecution clinic at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.In South Africa, murder is defined as the unlawful and intentional killing of another person. There are three different forms of intent that come into play when a judge is determining the length of a sentence. (Memorize the Latin terms like we did and you’ll seem super informed about this case.)Dolus directus, or direct intent. It was your goal to kill someone.Dolus eventualis, or knowing the possible result of your action will kill someone and recklessly going through with it anyway. It’s akin to second-degree murder, Dekle said.Dolus indirectus, or indirect intent. When a person’s death is a substantially certain outcome of your action, such as committing arson and knowing factory workers will die as a result.The judge could also decide the murder was not intentional and find Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, or an unlawful negligent killing. In that scenario, Pistorius ought to have foreseen the result of shooting through a door but did not, or he should have known Steenkamp was in the bathroom when shooting through the door, said Marius du Toit, a criminal defense attorney in South Africa who is tracking the case. The court would determine how a reasonable person in Pistorius’ situation would have acted that night and compare it to what he did.The bigger takeaway, Dekle said, is South African law has a high standard for premeditation.  ""When South African law says premeditation, what they mean is a prior plan to murder,"" Dekle said. ""That’s somewhat similar to our concept of cold, calculated and premeditated"" in Florida.On Good Morning America, Abrams tried to reference a South Africa case, Raath vs. The State, a decision cited alongside discussions of what constitutes premeditation, but Grace cut him off.A High Court revisited the case of a man who made his son open a safe so he could retrieve a revolver, which he used to kill his wife across the street moments later. The court reduced his life sentence to 22 years, arguing the lower court erred in deeming the murder as the result of premeditation. Even though there is no concrete definition for the term, the judge wrote, ""clearly the concept suggests a deliberate weighing up of the proposed criminal conduct as opposed to the commission of the crime on the spur of the moment or in unexpected circumstances.""It is correct that from the moment he appeared to conceive the idea of shooting his wife the appellant brooked no opposition and almost immediately proceeded to carry out the terrible deed. However, this does not, in my view, transform what appears to have been the deadly, but spur of the moment act or acts of a man in an emotional rage, into a planned and premeditated murder. In other words?""Grace has got it all wrong,"" du Toit, the South African criminal defense attorney, said. ""The period between the forming of the intention and the carrying out of the act is crucial to the test whether premeditation was present. Our courts have said repeatedly that premeditation does not occur on the ‘spur of the moment.’""The prosecution alleged premeditation in the Pistorius trial to get him to disclose his full version of the events leading up to Steenkamp’s death, du Toit said.Phelps, the law lecturer from South Africa, pointed to several cases, among them State vs. Dyonase, in which the accused killer retaliated to the victim’s previous assault and ransacking of his home by ambushing him as he returned from drinking with another friend and stabbing him to death. The court weighed whether the evidence showed a preconceived design or clear motive, which would prove premeditation. The court ruled the murder was not premeditated, preventing the killer from serving a minimum life sentence. (You can read more cases and Phelps’s commentary in this document.)Our rulingGrace and Abrams wrangled over the definition of premeditated murder, with Grace arguing, ""premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye.""Location, location, location.Legal experts told us it could in some parts of the United States, but it’s not as likely to meet South Africa’s heightened standards for premeditation. While the definition for what counts as premeditation is not finite, legal precedent shows South African courts are likely to require evidence that proves more planning than a ""spur of the moment"" decision.We rate her claim Mostly False.Thanks to our friends at reddit, both in our reddit community and in the /r/law subreddit, for weighing in on this fact-check.","https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/oscar-pistorius-trial-nancy-grace-dan-abrams-possiblity-23032034?tab=9482930&section=1206852&playlist=23035057,https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/28/world/africa/pistorius-trial-defense/index.html?hpt=hp_t2,https://www.courtlistener.com/mont/74UJ/state-v-brooks/,http://law.justia.com/cases/montana/supreme-court/1957/310-p-2d-571.html,http://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/2000/s00a0972-1.html,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2008/72.pdf,http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAECBHC/2010/11.html,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzR_9M-1WtJTdEF5WXgxaTNqMnBZLUUwTEwtdDVES3g4RHQ0/edit?usp=sharing,https://www.reddit.com/r/punditfact,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/21cu7w/nancy_grace_re_pistorius_trial_says_premeditated/",,"Criminal Justice,Legal Issues,Crime,PunditFact,Nancy Grace",,,,,

Johnson, whose ""war on poverty"" agenda in the mid 1960s was known as the Great Society.Superimposed on Johnson’s image is the following text: ""Black children born without a father in the home rate pre-LBJ's 'Great Society' welfare system in 1964: 7 percent. Black children born without a father in the home rate post-LBJ's 'Great Society' 2014 = 73 percent. Hey, liberals, how's your 'Great Society' working out for the black family?""We wanted to know if the meme’s numbers were right: Did the percentage of black children born without a father in the home rise from 7 percent before the Great Society to 73 percent today, and was it due to Johnson and the Great Society?As we researched this claim, we noticed a problem: There is no federal data on ""black children born without a father in the home."" Instead, we found two types of data that are similar -- but not a perfect fit.One is unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births. The other is the percentage of black children living without a father in the home.The first option addresses births, a key focus of the Facebook claim. But this figure ignores cases in which a couple isn’t married, but where the father is living in the home.The second option, by contrast, does address living arrangements, but it includes all children up to age 18, not those who were ""born"" that year.So to be as complete as possible, we’ll analyze both statistics here.Unmarried black births as a percentage of all black birthsIn 1964, according to federal health statistics, 24.6 percent of births to non-whites were considered ""illegitimate,"" the term used for out-of-wedlock births at the time.In 2012, the percentage of black births that were made to unmarried black mothers was 72 percent.This is a large increase, and the more recent figure is more or less on target. However, the starting point in 1964 is higher than the Facebook post suggests. So the overall increase is more limited than the meme says. (Note: The 1964 figure was based on the ""non-white"" population, a category that includes Hispanics and Asian-Americans, while the 2012 figure was for African Americans only.)So if you use this measurement, the meme’s numbers are off.The percentage of black children living without a father in the homeThese figures offer even less support for the Facebook claim.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021According to Census Bureau data, about 20 percent of black children in 1960 were living with just a mother. The comparable figure for 2013 is 50 percent of black children living with a mother only. (The only pre-Great Society year for which data is available is 1960.)So this measurement, too, shows an increase. But the increase is two-and-a-half times bigger, not 10 times bigger, as the meme says, and it’s up by 25 to 30 percentage points, rather than the 66 points cited in the meme.When we checked with experts, we found additional problems of context and logic with the claim. Here are a few of them:Black families weren’t the only group to see an increase in single motherhood over the same time periodRates of fatherlessness for whites have always been lower than for blacks, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. Six percent of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18 percent in 2013. That’s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children.We don’t really know how common black single parenthood was prior to the Great SocietyDouglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable. It was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a ""shotgun wedding"" pattern that doesn’t suggest long-term stability for children.This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African-Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low.""Welfare"" -- the implicit target of the meme -- existed well before the Great Society The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a ""marriage penalty"" on recipients -- benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. But such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society."" ‘Welfare’ was part of the New Deal in the 1930s,"" said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. ""It was designed for widows with kids who didn’t qualify for Social Security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers.""Correlation does not equal causationJust because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the Great Society doesn’t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play.Besharov said the focus on Johnson is off-base. He said that the broader social currents of 1960s ""liberalization"" -- more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance -- did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but ""if you define ‘the Great Society’ as the things Johnson did, then there was very little impact"" on single motherhood rates.Our rulingA meme circulating on social media said the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7 percent in 1964 to 73 percent today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.There’s no federal data to back up the meme’s specific claim, but the most applicable statistics show an increase in black fatherlessness that is more limited, and the rise might have been even more modest still if the early-1960s data had been more reliable.In addition, the focus on Johnson and the Great Society is likely a red herring, since broader, societal factors are believed to have played a major role in rising rates of single-parenthood -- not just among blacks, but also among whites.The exaggerated statistics, combined with an ignorance of important context, leads us to rate the claim False.","/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Children,Families,Marriage,Poverty,Facebook posts",,,,,

President Abraham Lincoln, Napolitano argued, could have undone slavery ""without causing the deaths of 785,000 human beings.""""How many deaths of human beings were caused by the American slave trade?"" Stewart shot back.""Unfortunately, a million and a half,"" Napolitano said.""Try 5 million or more,"" Stewart said.We are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we are looking at if the American slave trade, the process by which people were acquired and sold into slavery, resulted in the death of 5 million people or more. (Statistics focus on the slave trade, because experts say it's impossible to know the overall death toll caused by slavery in America.)We asked Comedy Central for Stewart’s source and did not hear back. But it seems likely Stewart got his information from another Daily Show guest. Historian Manisha Sinha from the University of Massachusetts was part of a panel in a mock game show called The Weakest Lincoln.Asked during the game to estimate the number of deaths, Sinha said 2 million to 5 million might have perished.So that would put Stewart on the high end of one estimate. But Stewart made an error in his characterization.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Sinha was talking about the Atlantic slave trade, which included slaves bound for South America, the Caribbean as well as North America, while Stewart focused on the American slave trade.So what's the American share? Starting in the late 1960s, historians began culling hard numbers on the slave trade from shipping manifests and other original documents. The result is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Database. It has tabulated an estimated 80 percent of the traffic in human beings and found about 10.7 million people survived the passage from their homeland between 1500 and 1866. Of that, about 390,000 made it to North American soil. This was about 3 percent of the total.Historian Herbert Klein of Columbia and Stanford universities, who worked on the database, said that the data suggest about 85,000 people destined for North America did not survive the trip across the Atlantic -- far below 5 million. (The same data show deaths caused by the slave trade in all of North and South America at about 1.8 million.)However, as exact as this information might be, it only goes so far. Much data is missing, either because it was lost or because no records were kept of the illegal shipments of slaves to North America that took place after 1808. That was the year when the United States banned the importation of slaves from Africa.Plus, as we noted, the database counts only the deaths due to the capture and transport of slaves and says nothing about the people who died in bondage from brutality, disease and deprivation.When the Civil War began, about 4 million people lived in slavery. According to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, half of all their babies died in the first year of life. That was twice the rate for white babies. Stanford Medical School cites the statistic that in 1850, the life expectancy of slaves was four years less than for whites.Our rulingStewart said the American slave trade caused the deaths of at least 5 million people. Stewart appears to be using an estimate for deaths associated with the slave trade in North and South America. America's portion is much smaller, an expert told us.We rate Stewart’s claim False.","http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-march-11-2014/exclusive---the-weakest-lincoln,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces,http://www.civil-war.net/census.asp?census=Total,http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/resources/facts-about-slave-trade-and-slavery,http://geriatrics.stanford.edu/ethnomed/african_american/fund/health_history/longevity.html",,"History,PunditFact,Jon Stewart",,,,,

Their examples include making recess appointments, issuing executive orders, delaying provisions of his health care law, refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and declining to deport certain categories of young illegal immigrants.At the 2014 CPAC conference, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated this point to the audience of conservative activists.Referring to Obama, Cruz said, ""This president of the United States is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore.""We were suspicious of this claim, because we recalled several instances in recent years of other presidents being accused of exceeding their executive authority.We checked with eight historians and legal scholars across the ideological spectrum to see whether they could point to prior examples of presidents choosing to ignore laws. They came up with a number of examples. (Cruz’s office did not return an inquiry for this story.)While Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he believes Obama is ""setting records for the number, scope, and creativity of unconstitutional and illegal behavior,"" he acknowledged that ""Obama wasn't the first president to violate the law and won't be the last.""Here’s a trip down memory lane to review just some of the instances in which presidents are believed to have acted in ways that ignored existing legal or constitutional limits:• Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War era, Lincoln ""broke an assortment of laws and ignored one constitutional provision after another,"" according to an analysis by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Lincoln waged war without a congressional declaration of war (or even a Congress in session to declare one), spent $2 million to raise an army without congressional appropriation, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, among other actions.""Following a strategy of ‘unilateral action,’ Lincoln justified his powers as an emergency authority granted to him by the people,"" the Miller Center analysis concludes. ""He had been elected, he told his critics, to decide when an emergency existed and to take all measures required to deal with it. In doing so, Lincoln maintained that the President was one of three ‘coordinate’ departments of government, not in any way subordinate to Congress or the courts.""• Andrew Johnson. After the Civil War ended and Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson became president and almost immediately clashed with Congress over how to treat the former Confederacy. Edwin M. Stanton, who had been Secretary of War under Lincoln, retained his position under Johnson and became one of the new president’s biggest critics, asserting that the federal government should intervene more forcefully to protect freed slaves’ rights in the South.In 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval before a president fired federal officials who had originally been confirmed by the Senate. When Johnson tried to oust Stanton, the Senate blocked him; when Johnson made a second ouster attempt, the House impeached him. (Johnson ultimately survived impeachment, Stanton resigned, and the Tenure of Office Act was repealed in 1887.)• Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On March 11, 1941, as World War II was already under way in Europe -- and while the United States was still officially on the sidelines -- Roosevelt signed a landmark law known as the Lend-Lease Act. At the time, Britain was under siege and almost out of money, so the law authorized the president to sell, lease, or lend military hardware to any country he designated as vital to American national security.However, a provision in the law would have allowed Congress to terminate the president’s powers after a certain amount of time through a ""concurrent resolution."" This amounted to a ""legislative veto"" by a simple majority and without the president’s signature. Roosevelt believed this to be unconstitutional, but he signed the bill anyway, secretly writing a  memorandum to Attorney General Robert H. Jackson explaining that ""the emergency was so great that I signed the bill in spite of a clearly unconstitutional provision contained in it."" Jackson only made the episode public in 1953.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021• Harry Truman. In the midst of the Korean War, Truman had to grapple with labor disputes within the steel industry -- a sector he considered vital to the war effort. In a bid to head off a looming work stoppage, Truman in 1952 ordered his Commerce Secretary to seize the steel mills. The industry objected, and Truman’s seizure was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer.• Richard Nixon. Citing government spending as a reason for surging inflation, Nixon refused to spend nearly $12 billion of congressionally appropriated funds for 1973 and 1974. He did so under an executive action known as ""impoundment"" -- an action that had been used by many presidents previously, but with questionable constitutionality. Faced with Nixon’s unusually large impoundment -- and with the president bogged down in Watergate -- Congress rebelled, passing legislation to make impoundment illegal. Nixon vetoed the bill, Congress overrode his veto, and Nixon stood his ground. The administration challenged the new law barring impoundment, but a federal court sided with Congress, saying impoundment was unconstitutional.• Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s quest to fight communism suffered a setback in the middle of his first term when the Democratic Congress in 1983 passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted the CIA and the Defense Department from operating in Nicaragua. An even stronger version passed the following year. The Reagan administration diverted some of the proceeds of a secret arms sale to Iran to the anti-communist militia in Nicaragua known as the Contras, an action that directly violated the Boland Amendment.Several top advisers to Reagan were implicated in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. While the Reagan-appointed Tower Commission said Reagan's disengagement from White House management had made the diversion possible, Reagan himself was never formally linked to the violation of the Boland amendment.• George W. Bush. While president, Bush issued 161 signing statements -- that is, official pronouncements that accompany the signing of a bill into law. In addition to commenting on the law generally, signing statements have been used to document the president’s constitutional objections to provisions contained in the law, and sometimes to announce how (or whether) parts of the law will be enforced. Bush was hardly the first to issue signing statements, but he was the most prolific.According to the Congressional Research Service, Bush issued 161 signing statements, which is a smaller number than each of his three immediate predecessors. But 79 percent of Bush’s statements -- a much higher rate -- noted a challenge or objection to the law being signed, rather than offering relatively innocuous comments. Meanwhile, many statements contained multiple reservations, making the total number more than 1,000.The American Bar Association published a report asserting that Bush’s statements were ""contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers"" when they ""claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress.""Like Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt before him, Bush ""asserted the power to violate certain laws if necessary to defend the country,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Bush’s signing statements typically said that he would interpret laws restricting executive authority, such as a law forbidding cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees, in a manner consistent with his understanding of his power as commander-in-chief. What that meant, it turned out when the memos were declassified, was that the law did not bind him if he believed certain actions were necessary to national security — the ‘commander-in-chief override.’ ""Our rulingWe found that at least seven presidents -- including some of the nation’s most admired occupants of the White House -- acted, at least on occasion, in ways that ignored specific laws or constitutional protections. It is not accurate to say, as Cruz does, that Obama would be ""the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."" Presidents have done so frequently, and historians expect that they will continue to do so. We rate the claim False.***EDITOR’S NOTE, March 11, 2014: After we published our story, Cruz’s office provided the following response:""Since the dawn of the republic, the president and Congress have resisted attempts from each other to encroach upon their constitutional powers. Many presidents have asserted, and have abused, executive authority. No one is arguing that President Obama is the first to make this mistake. As Sen. Cruz has detailed in three reports, a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, no president until President Obama has ever claimed the authority to ignore the explicit text of statutes passed by Congress and unilaterally replace that text with whatever the president wishes. From Obamacare to immigration, to same sex marriage, to marijuana laws, President Obama’s willingness to ignore or alter law is unquestionably outside the scope of executive power. It amounts to legislating, pure and simple.""However, we don’t agree that there’s a significant distinction between ""abus(ing) executive authority"" and a ""willingness to ignore or alter law,"" so we feel comfortable with the historical examples we used to analyze Cruz’s statement.

The award went to 12 Years a Slave, the powerful true story of a black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South during the mid-1800s.In accepting the award, director Steve McQueen delivered an emotional tribute.""Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live.

So we decided to put McQueen’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter.Modern slavery is often referred to today as ""forced labor"" or sometimes ""trafficking in persons."" It’s not as easily defined as the slave trade of the antebellum American South, nor is it simple to identify victims.The United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines trafficking in persons two ways. There is sex trafficking ""in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age."" Then there’s a more general category: ""the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.""There are many different examples of modern slavery worldwide. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, looks for 11 indicators to identify forced labor:Abuse of vulnerabilityDeceptionRestriction of movementIsolationPhysical and sexual violenceIntimidation and threatsRetention of identity documentsFeatured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021Withholding of wagesDebt bondageAbusive working and living conditionsExcessive overtime.Estimates on modern slavery vary because victims are difficult to identify and do not often come forward.The United Nation’s International Labor Organization believes the best way to get statistics on slavery is through national surveys, but so far ""only a handful of countries have undertaken special surveys on this topic."" As a result ""the practice is extremely difficult to research and quantify as it is most often hidden and out-of-sight of law enforcement.""Because of this, only 46,570 victims were formally documented by law enforcement agencies internationally in 2012, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report.Still, overall estimates exist.The International Labor Organization estimated in June 2012 that 20.9 million individuals were in forced labor. This included 15.4 million adults and 5.5 million children. About 55 percent are women or girls.By far, the most common purveyor of forced labor is in Asia, where 11.7 million are in slave-like conditions. Africa is second at 3.7 million.Labor exploitation is most common worldwide with 14.2 million forced laborers, while 4.5 million are exploited for sex. State-enforced labor entraps 2.2 million, the group estimated.The organization has changed how it calculates the figure. As recently as 2005, the estimate for forced laborers was much smaller, at 12 million people, so identifying trends is not possible using their data.Other organizations, however, have estimated that the figure is much higher. Luis CdeBaca, the Ambassador-at-Large in the Office To Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, testified to Congress in 2013 that there were ""up to 27 million people living in slavery."" A State Department spokesman told us that language was agreed to after consulting with industry experts.The Walk Free Foundation, an international organization committed to ending modern slavery, estimates the figure at between 28.3 million and 31.3 million in its Global Slavery Index.We reached out to McQueen’s representation to see if they could provide a source for his claim. If we hear back, we’ll update the post.Our ruling In his acceptance speech, McQueen said he dedicated his Oscar to the ""21 million people who still suffer slavery today."" That figure is based on a 2012 estimate from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. Estimates vary across organizations, and a true headcount is nearly impossible to predict with any certainty. Still, McQueen cited the estimate of the international community’s most reliable source.

Since President Obama has been in office, we've reached the point we're cutting the annual deficits in half, and we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.""On first glance, the data doesn’t seem to back up the claim that ""the overall debt of the United States"" is poised to drop by $3 trillion -- or even by a dime -- over the next decade.A quick refresher: The deficit is a fiscal shortfall for one year, while the debt is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses.The most widely trusted source for federal fiscal projections -- the independent Congressional Budget Office -- recently released an annual report, ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024.""In it, CBO estimated the amount of publicly held federal debt for each of the next 10 years. In 2014, the debt is pegged to be $12.7 trillion. By 2024, the debt is set to rise to almost $21.3 trillion. That’s an $8.6 trillion increase, not a $3 trillion decrease.We also checked to see whether Durbin was talking about a decrease in what CBO projected the debt to be 10 years out.In the equivalent ""Budget and Economic Outlook"" report that was released in 2009, just days before Obama took office, CBO projected that in 2019 -- the final year of that report’s 10-year window -- the debt would be $9.3 trillion. By contrast, in the report released a few weeks ago, CBO projected that the debt level in 2019 would be $16 trillion. So again, the future projection of debt is going up, not down.When we checked with Durbin’s office, spokesman Max Gleischman said the senator was referring to ""the amount of deficit reduction Congress has already enacted,"" adding that ""he actually understates it by about a trillion dollars.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021He pointed us to projections by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which estimated that such measures as the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2013 American Taxpayer Relief Act are collectively poised to ""shrink deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the 2014-2023 period,"" as long as the deep, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration remain in place. This figure includes spending cuts, revenue increases, and reductions in the amount of interest on the debt.But look closely at the language: The center’s report consistently refers to the ""deficit,"" not the ""debt."" As we noted earlier, the deficit is a single year’s shortfall, while the debt is total money owed.The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tallied up all the expected reductions in the annual deficit from these laws over the next 10 years, and it found that they combined to equal $4 trillion. But while these reductions in the deficit, if they materialize, would hardly be trivial, they would not be big enough to actually create annual surpluses -- and surpluses are the only thing that can reduce the cumulative debt, rather than adding to the debt at a slower pace.Our rulingDurbin said that under current policies, ""we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.""It's obvious now that Durbin meant deficits, not debt. But that doesn't mean it was obvious to everyone watching Fox News Sunday. And Durbin, who has been in Congress for 30 years, certainly should know and be able to articulate the difference.The fact is that people remember the national debt -- there's a whole clock for it -- and it's expected to continue increasing, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Instead of going down $3 trillion, the best estimate is it will rise by $8.6 trillion.That's a difference of ... $11.6 trillion.

One statistic he used to cite the size of metro Atlanta’s economy surprised us, so we decided to do some fact-checking.The annual gross domestic product of metro Atlanta, the mayor said, is ""bigger than 28 states in the union.""Is it really that large?Mayoral spokesman Carlos Campos said Reed was using U.S. Commerce Department data as the basis for his claim. We looked at the data, and the most recent statistics we found show the mayor’s statement might be conservative.Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the total market value of all of the goods and services produced within the boundaries of a specific area.Federal officials define the Atlanta metropolitan area as 28 counties that stretch as far north as Dawson, south to Meriwether, as far west as Haralson and as far east as Walton and Jasper counties. It includes Georgia’s four highest-populated counties: Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The Atlanta metropolitan area had nearly 5.3 million residents in 2010, the ninth-highest total in the nation.In addition to having a large labor force, metro Atlanta has two major transportation hubs that have helped its economy race ahead of other regions. One is Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which ranks among the world’s busiest airports.The other is the ports of Savannah and Brunswick, which are considered to be among the fastest-growing ports in terms of the volume of items shipped there. Although the ports are not located in metro Atlanta, Reed and others note they are important to the region’s economy. About 180,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the 28-county Atlanta region can be attributed to the ports, according to a 2012 University of Georgia study.The region has 11 Fortune 500 companies with Atlanta addresses, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber.

Reed used that same number in his remarks.Among metropolitan areas, Atlanta’s GDP is the 10th-highest nationally, which is about where it should be considering it has the ninth-largest population. In order, the metropolitan areas with the largest gross domestic products are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Boston.In terms of how Atlanta fares in comparison with other states, only 16 states had a higher GDP. In order, those states were California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota.Metro Atlanta would also beat out the rest of the state.

But as commentators of all ideological stripes grappled with the complexities of this headline-grabbing statistic, discussion branched out into the question of whether a worker’s individual decision to work less was something positive, negative or a mixture of the two for the economy as a whole.Obama supporters suggested that the opportunity to buy health insurance outside a job was a boon to workers who hated their job or who wanted to work less so they could spend more time taking care of children or aging relatives. The president’s critics saw it as an example of the government essentially using tax dollars to encourage people not to work.This topic came up during a roundtable on the Feb. 9, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday.During the segment, syndicated columnist George Will told host Chris Wallace, ""People forget Social Security was advocated ... in the 1930s, as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country.""We’d always believed Social Security stemmed from a desire help keep the elderly out of poverty, so we decided to take a look. (Will’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)We checked with eight historians who have written about the 1930s, including several who have studied the Social Security legislation that President Franklin D. Roosevelt shepherded into law in 1935. They told us there’s little evidence that Roosevelt or his administration sold Social Security as a way to get people to quit working, thus opening up jobs for younger, unemployed workers.However, several historians pointed to a different pension proposal that was popular in the United States at the time. This proposal, known as the Townsend Plan, did make that argument, more or less -- and its popularity was strong enough that it’s credited with prodding Roosevelt into advancing the more modest, compromise proposal that would ultimately become Social Security.The Townsend PlanIn 1933, during the depths of the Depression, a doctor from Long Beach, Calif., named Francis E. Townsend came up with a plan to support the elderly.Under the proposal, the government would provide a $200-a-month pension to citizens age 60 or older, funded by a 2 percent national tax on transactions. To receive the benefits, a citizen would have to be retired and not a ""habitual"" criminal. And they would need to spend all of the money within 30 days.This appears to be the source of the notion that Social Security stemmed from efforts to get older Americans to retire.The Townsend Plan ""was explicitly supposed to free up jobs, as well as stimulate the economy through spending,"" said Edwin Amenta, a University of California-Irvine sociologist who wrote the 2006 book, When Movements Matter: The Townsend Plan and the Rise of Social Security. ""It was meant to end the Depression and bring permanent prosperity.""The plan became wildly popular. ""Dr. Townsend published his plan in a local Long Beach newspaper in early 1933, and within about two years, there were 7,000 Townsend Clubs around the country with more than 2.2 million members actively working to make the Townsend Plan the nation's old-age pension system,"" according to the Social Security Administration’s historical office. Public opinion surveys in 1935 found that 56 percent of Americans favored adoption of the Townsend Plan.This is not to say that the plan made much sense economically (Townsend was not a trained economist.) More plausible projections suggested that the tax rate would have needed to be between 6 percent and 14 percent -- not 2 percent -- to cover the cost of $200-a-month pensions. And there was no guarantee that the money spent by beneficiaries would exceed the amount that would have been spent by the taxpayers from whom it was taken -- a problem if you are trying to increase the amount of overall economic activity in the economy.And those $200-a-month pensions? They were double the typical monthly pay of ordinary workers. ""It may well have been the most generous retirement pension promise of all time,"" according to the Social Security Administration’s historian.Roosevelt’s Social SecurityThe Townsend Plan may have been economic pie in the sky -- but it had serious political influence. The strength of the grassroots movement that supported it is credited with pushing Roosevelt to fast-track an alternative.Roosevelt’s Labor secretary, Frances Perkins, wrote in her memoir The Roosevelt I Knew that the president said Congress ""can't stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we are studying social security, a solid plan which will give some assurance to old people of systematic assistance upon retirement.""Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Roosevelt’s more cautious plan was based on Americans being taxed on their earnings from work, then qualifying for old-age benefits based on how much they had paid into the system. By contrast, under Townsend’s plan, workers did not have to pay into the system, and the benefits they received were identical, regardless of how wealthy or poor they were.""The administration contrasted its proposal with the utopian and fantastic schemes of the Townsend Plan, and there was no suggestion that these pensions would end the Depression or significantly solve unemployment problems"" of the ongoing depression, Amenta said.Indeed, Social Security was not designed to pay out benefits until 1942 -- seven years after passage. While that was eventually moved up to 1939, the delay in offering benefits undercuts the notion that the government wanted to force people to retire quickly and en masse.""Restoring the financial condition of the elderly in a way that did not bankrupt the country was a primary motivation for the program,"" said Edward Berkowitz, a historian at George Washington University and the author of several books about the history of Social Security. ""Getting Americans to quit was only an indirect motivation.""Indeed, in its public rhetoric, the administration played up the program’s ability to help the elderly, not on its larger macroeconomic impact. That seemed to mesh with public expectations.""The idea of creating a public pension system for the general population had been around since the 1920s or even earlier on the political left, but they faced three successive Republican presidents who were uninterested,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""So, nothing happened until there was a Democratic president with a large congressional majority backing him up.""When Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, he said, ""Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled. … We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.""Where the evidence supports Will’s claimWhile Will’s statement is largely unsupported, several historians said he has a partial point.Other pieces of Roosevelt’s agenda, including establishment of the National Recovery Administration from 1933 and 1935 and his reemployment agreements in 1933 ""had goals of reducing weekly hours while maintaining or increasing employment"" -- a mission not all that different from Will’s scenario, said Price Fishback, a University of Arizona economist. ""Those fears were still there in 1935.""Some scholars have also argued that the creation of Social Security actually helped crystallize the previously unfamiliar concept of ""retirement.""In an influential if somewhat controversial 1980 book, A History of Retirement: The Meaning and Function of an American Institution, 1885-1978, historian William Graebner wrote that Social Security grew out of a broader movement in industry toward the notion of retirement as a life stage, ""one of whose functions was to move older people out of the workforce, partly for reasons of job availability and partly for reasons of efficiency,"" wrote Kathleen W. Jones, a Virginia Tech historian. Graebner, she wrote, saw Social Security as a way to reduce unemployment among the young.On balance, though, scholars say it’s important not to overplay the idea that Roosevelt intended -- or ""advocated,"" to use Will’s word -- for Social Security to be a tool for transitioning the elderly out of the work force.What Will pointed to ""is part of the story, although not the whole story by any means, because the crisis of the elderly was so severe,"" said Michael Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. ""All major institutions and policies have multiple, not always consistent purposes.""Our rulingWill said, ""Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country.""The idea that old-age pensions would transition older Americans out of the labor market and usher in younger, unemployed workers was a goal of the Townsend Plan (and of some other Roosevelt policies). But judging both by its design and by the rhetoric used to sell it, Roosevelt’s Social Security Act was targeted more at alleviating poverty among the elderly than at shaping the demographics of the labor market. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.***EDITOR’S NOTE, Feb. 12, 2014: After we published this fact-check, a reader pointed us to an April 28, 1935, ""fireside chat"" by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that seemed to provide clearer support for George Will’s claim. Roosevelt said, ""The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. … It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.""When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt’s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record. ""Promoting retirement was a minor goal at best of the old-age parts of the legislation,"" said University of California-Irvine sociologist Edwin Amenta. Historian Jeff Shesol cited ""the near-absence of this argument, not only in Roosevelt’s many remarks over the years but also in the internal deliberations, as recounted by multiple participants, over the Social Security framework.""Since our original analysis had already acknowledged that transitioning older workers out of the labor force was ""part of the story"" of Social Security -- just not the main part -- we are sticking to our ruling of Mostly False.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obamacare-expected-destroy-23-mi/,https://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/12/jay-leno/leno-says-social-security-took-7-years-issue-its-f/,https://theretiringprofessor.wordpress.com/,http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma02/volpe/newdeal/unemployment_fireside_text.html",,"Economy,History,Poverty,Social Security,Workers,PunditFact,George Will",,,,,

How was that conveyed by the pundits?""The CBO now says the president's health care law will cut the number of full-time jobs in the United States by 2.3 million by 2021,"" said Gretchen Carlson of Fox News. In the interview that followed, interrupted by a live briefing on the report from the White House, Carlson noted that much of the change stems from people deciding not to work.Carlson then went onto interview U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, where they discussed workers who have a difficult time finding full-time work.But Carlson’s statement is missing an important distinction that the CBO report makes between workers and jobs. (And it’s a mistake we’ve spotted before.) Carlson makes it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don’t create them or they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce.Here are the key quotes from the report:""CBO’s projections of hours worked represent a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024.""""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor.""The government analysts basically figured that millions of people will decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more affordable.""It will not represent an increase in either the unemployment rate or the number of unemployed workers,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based academic research center. ""Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented.""For economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California - San Diego, this result is no surprise. The law gives most of its assistance to people making less money.""Subsidizing insurance for low-income households, and providing Medicaid to the poor, involves reducing the returns to work. As earned income rises, the benefits phase out,"" Clemens said.The CBO report tracks with that, noting that the voluntary decisions to leave the workforce would be concentrated among lower-paid jobs.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include actual full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping a job but working fewer hours, keeping one job but quitting a separate, part-time job, or leaving the workforce.And to be clear, the report predicts that total employment will rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist.A drop in the number of people who feel they need to work actually could even be a boon to those who remain in the labor force, especially with relatively high unemployment.""Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs,"" said Burtless. ""After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage.""Still, the CBO expects the current unemployment rate to remain elevated; it won’t drop below 6 percent until 2017.This is not to say there are no downsides woven into the CBO projections. The labor force participation rate is expected to decline, putting a larger burden on those who remain working.""Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity,"" said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California - Berkeley.As the economy returns to full employment, Burtless expects that there would be a shortage of low-wage workers.""The remaining taxpayers will have to pay slightly higher taxes to finance public health insurance subsidies than they would otherwise have to pay if the work hours of low-wage workers remained unchanged,"" Burtless said.Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair said. ""But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing.""Our rulingCarlson said that the CBO predicts that Obamacare will cut the number of full-time jobs by 2.3 million. The word ""cut"" sends the message that jobs are being taken away, but that's not the case. On top of that, the statement confuses the number of jobs with the number of workers, and more specifically, the number of hours worked. The CBO said the health care law will give more people an incentive to reduce their hours; some will limit their hours and some will stop working altogether by their own choice. The law would not push up unemployment.It can be easy to miss the distinction between jobs and workers, but the statement remains flawed.

""That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work.""It was not the first time Obama (or other Democrats) have offered the 77-cent data point -- not by a long shot. A search on the White House website calls up literally dozens of examples of policy papers, blog posts and speeches in which the president cited the 77-cent statistic. He used it in a proclamation for National Equal Pay Day (July 20, 2010), in remarks at a White House forum on women and the economy (April 6, 2012), in a conference call with reporters (June 4, 2012), and remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act (June 10, 2013), just to cite a few.Before we get into the statistics, we need to explain how we’re approaching this claim in this fact-check. We’ve heard the 77-cent statistic used a lot of different ways, and small changes in wording make a big difference in determining whether it’s accurate or not.The less accurate version -- once offered by Obama himself -- states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, or in the same job. As we’ll explain below, the data doesn’t show that. By contrast, the more accurate version simply states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, period. That is more accurate (though not without some caveats, also listed below).We struggled a bit with how to classify the claim Obama made in the State of the Union, since his phrasing was somewhat ambiguous. He used the more accurate formulation, but he then followed up two sentences later by saying, ""Women deserve equal pay for equal work."" Did Obama’s ""equal pay for equal work"" line suggest that he believes the 77-cent pay differential refers to statistical comparisons of ""equal work""? Or was this sentence simply a philosophical statement that was distinct from the statistical claim?Ultimately, we decided that Obama’s statement that ""women deserve equal pay for equal work"" was aspirational rather than a part of his statistical claim, so we’re judging him on his claim that women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.""Here’s a rundown of what we’ve found in the past, updated for the most recent data.Ratios vary depending on the methodologyThe basic federal data comes from two agencies -- the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the two agencies’ numbers don’t exactly agree.The Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country -- a percentage in line with what it’s been for the last few years. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation.Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. BLS found that women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $669 in 2012, which was 82 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. This, too, was in line with the ratio in recent years.What’s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers.Another measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women were paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men in 2012. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.99, compared to $13.88 for men. However, this figure excludes salaried workers -- another reason why the statistics differ.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told PolitiFact in 2012 that the measure of annual wages is preferable, since it doesn’t exclude salaried workers. ""It’s the one that goes back the furthest in time,"" she said. ""It’s the one that is most traditional.""But some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing ""an incomplete picture"" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, ""which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same.""In other words, there’s a range of professional opinion on what the data shows.Differences in jobs heldIt’s important to point out a few additional caveats.First, there’s a significant variation in wage gaps from occupation to occupation.The Institute for Women’s Policy research looked at pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varied depending on the sector, though women lag in nearly every category. Nurses (96 cents for every dollar) and cashiers (90 cents) were closer than most; accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents) were more divergent than most.Second, it’s important to note that the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean that the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination. Rather, some portion is likely the result of broader demographic patterns.For instance, men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as ""occupational segregation."" Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. When data from all these fields is combined together, as in the Census and BLS studies, the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are.In addition, women disproportionately obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and they take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. Despite the growth in fathers’ role in child care, the child-care burden shouldered by women tends to restrict their career options and hours worked.While such patterns raise important policy questions, they don’t necessarily point to discrimination per se.So how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. A U.S. Labor Department blog post put it a bit higher -- around 40 percent. The CONSAD paper suggested that when you control for every factor but discrimination, the gap shrunk to between 93 cents and 95 cents -- not zero, but significantly smaller than the 77-cent figure Obama used.When we checked with the White House, a spokesman acknowledged that there is more than one way to calculate the gender pay gap, and that discrimination isn’t the only factor causing the gap. But the spokesman added that it would be wrong to ignore how discrimination and differences in workplace flexibility impact occupational choice.Our rulingObama said women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.""It's worth noting that the entire 77-cent gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some listeners might have drawn when hearing Obama mention ""equal pay for equal work"" shortly after citing the 77-cent figure. And there are alternative calculations that show a smaller overall gap. Still, the 77-cent ratio is a credible figure from a credible agency. We rate the claim Mostly True.","https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-equal-pay,https://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/04/06/president-obama-speaks-white-house-forum-women-and-economy#transcript,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/04/remarks-president-equal-pay-equal-work-conference-call,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/10/remarks-president-50th-anniversary-equal-pay-act,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/,https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jul/15/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-women-earn-77-percent-mens-pay-same/,https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/24/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-women-earn-only-77-per/,https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2013/apr/24/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-cites-wage-gap-between-ohio-women/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/diana-degette/diana-degette-says-women-earn-77-cents-every-dolla/,https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf,http://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf,http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2012.pdf,http://pewresearch.org/pubs/536/working-women,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-by-occupation-updated-april-2011/at_download/file,http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/articles/?id=2160,http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-by-occupation-1/,http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-by-occupation-updated-april-2011/at_download/file,http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf,http://social.dol.gov/blog/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/",,"National,Jobs,Women,Barack Obama",,,,,

Violations of the prohibitions, the section says, are felonies punishable by fines and/or imprisonment.Experts say restriction doesn't leash free speechWe spotted nothing there about being leashed from speaking your mind or coaxing others to do so.Experts agreed.Attorney Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, told us by email that Paul was restricted for one year under the standard one-year ""cooling off"" period for all House members and senior staff; senators face a two-year limit. ""During that time,"" Gross said. ""a former member may not appear before Congress on substantive matters but that restriction does not prohibit public appearances."" By email, another expert, attorney Brett Kappel, who specializes in campaign-related laws, agreed with Gross’ analysis.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 3, 2021 in a press conference“I don’t even know what (QAnon) is.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 4, 2021Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which says it promotes ethics and accountability by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests, told us by phone the one-year restriction could extend to keeping Paul and other former House members from lobbying members by testifying before a committee.Then again, Sloan said, members could still be invited to offer their views on topics. By email, she noted a May 12, 2010, report by the advisory non-partisan Congressional Research Service stating: ""The prohibition goes only to advocacy-type of communications, that is, communications ‘with the intent to influence’ a member or officer or employee of the legislative branch concerning ""any matter on which such person seeks official action"" by that member, officer or employee, or by either house of Congress. There are also several specific exceptions to the general prohibition, including, for example, exceptions for lobbying and advocacy work for state or local governments, testifying on matters under oath, and generally for representations or communications on behalf of political candidates, parties and political organizations.""Upshot: A former House member must take a year off from advocating positions on issues with members of Congress. Sloan and Gross each said, though, that former House members aren’t restricted from generally speaking out.Paul, Gross said, ""was permitted to make public appearances and espouse views. However, he was restricted in making one-on-one appearance(s) before and lobbying members of Congress and staff.""After reading a portion of Paul’s email blast, Sloan commented by email: ""From the missive, it appears Paul does have legislative interests. If he wanted to personally lobby Congress on these issues, he was prohibited from doing so for the past year... Sending emails to supporters trying to galvanize them around issues like auditing the Fed isn’t lobbying and would be permissible. So the concept that every word in these emails had to be reviewed by lawyers to comply with the lobbying ban is nonsense.""Sloan said in a follow-up email: ""I have trouble imagining what Paul wanted to do that he couldn’t do--if he wanted to write op-eds, appear on television, or have speaking engagements, all of that would have been allowed.""Paul spoke out during yearA search for news stories using the Nexis news database gave indications that Paul often aired his views in the year at issue.On April 23, 2013, Paul gave an interview to Bloomberg News covering the value of the dollar and also touching on his views of the bitcoin and immigration laws. On June 10, 2013, Paul gave thanks for leakers of documents revealing the government’s eavesdropping efforts, according to a CNN news blog post. A day later, Paul said in a telephone interview on Fox Business News that the government might kill leaker Edward Snowden with a missile. On CNN’s Aug. 15, 2013, ""Situation Room,"" Paul questioned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s qualifications to be president and said his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was prepared to be president. His comments also touched on his concerns about central economic planning by the Federal Reserve. On Sept. 19, 2013, Paul appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" offering his interpretation of an announcement by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.An Oct. 1, 2013, US News news story quoted Paul describing the temporary government shutdown as ""less of an event than everyone’s claiming it to be."" Paul said generally: ""Republicans and Democrats are basically in agreement with authoritarianism. They believe that one way or another you have to be an authoritarian, to tell you how to spend your money [and] both of them tell you how to run your personal life. And they're both very excited about telling every country what to do, and giving them money if they behave or bombing them if they don't.""In the year, Paul also helped launch the online RonPaulChannel, telling the Washington Times for a news story posted Aug. 8, 2013: ""It will give me an opportunity to talk about the issues I've been talking about for 30 years. But it's in a different format. I won't be cut off from my subscribers because we plan to take their questions through email, interview individuals and go in-depth."" The story quoted Paul as saying that the channel had pulled in 200,000 subscribers within hours of a publicity announcement that week, drawn by his personal guarantee they would not confront censors, or the ""games and lies"" of traditional broadcast and cable channels.The channel’s website has about 40 taped video messages from Paul that were placed online before the one-year cooling-off period ended, starting with an Aug. 15, 2013, commentary on Egypt and the United States extending to a Jan. 2, 2014, commentary on Iran sanctions.Our attempt to reach a spokeswoman for Campaign for Liberty about our findings was unsuccessful.Our rulingPaul said he was censored and muzzled for the year after he left the House.That's not factually supported. Far as we could tell, in contrast, Paul freely voiced his views on issues in most every way possible during the year, though he was barred, as a former member, from directly lobbying lawmakers.We rate this claim as False.","http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=p000583,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y8Wi2P8MqVBIcfThJasEynZ3jRQk4qQfqnDWoZTTW5o/pub,http://www.campaignforliberty.org/about/faq/,http://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/Highlights_Memorandum_2012.pdf,http://www.skadden.com/professionals/kenneth-gross,http://www.arentfox.com/people/brett-kappel#.Utm8OLTnaUk,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/kevin-mccarthy/3-times-kevin-mccarthy-has-talked-about-qanon/,https://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/melanie-sloan,https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-875.pdf,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/04/23/ron_paul_on_gold_no_one_knows_value_im_buying.html,http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/10/ron-paul-gives-thanks-for-leaker/,https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2472695918001/ron-paul-worried-us-might-use-drone-to-kill-nsa-leaker/#sp=show-clips,http://situationroom.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/16/ron-paul-christie-offers-nothing/?hpt=sr_mid,http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/09/ron-paul-fed-move-wont-help-99-.html,https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/01/ron-paul-isnt-thrilled-by-rather-annoying-shutdown-debate,http://www.ronpaulchannel.com/,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/8/ron-paul-counting-on-his-natural-enthusiasm-on-his/,http://www.ronpaulchannel.com/video/special-dispatch-hypocrisy-of-egypt-policy/,http://www.ronpaulchannel.com/video/al-qaeda-affiliated-group-takes-infamous-iraqi-city/",,"Congress,Ethics,Texas,Ron Paul",,,,,

So when a reader was curious about the accuracy of an Internet meme about hemp -- a close botanical cousin of marijuana that has been caught up on in the war on drugs -- they sent it our way.The graphic says: ""In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down.""The claim has proliferated all over the Internet. Sometimes a source is listed (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives), but none of the repetitions ever seems to have a checkable citation, much less a direct link to a verifiable source. We decided to take a closer look.First, some background on hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, but hemp has much lower levels of THC, the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana a drug. Over the years, hemp has been used to make a wide variety of products, from rope, fabrics and paper to food and fuel, but its use in the United States dwindled after World War II.After more than a decade of dormancy as a crop in the United States, hemp was effectively outlawed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which drew no distinctions between hemp and cannabis, presumably because the two plants look so similar that it would be easy to conceal illegal marijuana plants in a field of hemp. Some states have since loosened their laws about hemp cultivation, but federal law remains a steep obstacle to efforts to revive the domestic hemp industry.Because the legal fates of marijuana and hemp have been closely intertwined over the years, supporters of decriminalizing marijuana have often made common cause with those who would like to revive hemp as a crop in the United States. That’s why the Internet meme we are checking struck a chord among marijuana-legalization supporters on social media.Still, widely believed doesn’t necessarily mean correct. Did the U.S. government really predict that hemp would, in the course of three decades, make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper?The notion is not entirely implausible. The Agriculture Department does have ""a lot of pre-World War II material on hemp,"" said Wayne Olson, a librarian at the National Agricultural Library, which is part of the Agriculture Department. That’s because hemp was once a cultivated crop in many states, especially Kentucky.The best known of these Agriculture Department documents is Bulletin 404, which features a pair of studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds -- a part of the hemp plant -- to make paper.This document has played a key role in the arguments of those who support legalizing hemp and marijuana, due partly to numerous citations in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, a book initially published in 1985 by the late Jack Herer, a pro-cannabis activist. Herer’s volume has been widely read within the pro-cannabis community, though it’s been questioned by historians for the quality of its scholarship.Even though Bulletin 404 was mentioned at several points in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, Herer’s book never makes the claim circulating in the Internet meme we’re checking. More to the point, when we looked at Bulletin 404 itself, we couldn’t find any reference to a prediction that ""by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp.""The papers that comprise Bulletin 404 are highly technical, dwelling on matters such as how much caustic soda was used in the tests and how to measure ""unsieved hurds.""Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Truth be told, the authors’ powers of prediction were rather faulty. They wrote that ""there appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest use and consumption, the present supply can not withstand the demands placed upon it."" As anyone who uses paper knows, that certainly didn’t come to pass. Nor did the authors’ prediction that, ""without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States."" And even that is not the same thing as predicting that all paper will eventually come from hemp.So Bulletin 404 is a dead end. What about other papers?Tom Murphy, the National Outreach Coordinator with the group Vote Hemp, pointed us to one additional document dating from around the same time -- a 72-page chapter from the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1913. But this document didn’t make the claim we’re checking, either.Olson of the National Agricultural Laboratory was skeptical that the claim actually exists somewhere in the department’s archives. ""I have been here since 1987 and have a pretty good idea what’s in the collection, but I have not heard that quote,"" he said.And Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration said that his office, at our request, searched the general correspondence on hemp for 1916 and 1917 as well as the Online Public Access Catalog. Such a claim could not be located, he said.Academics expressed skepticism that the claim was made.""I never encountered this statement,"" said Michael Schaller, a University of Arizona historian. ""At various times there have been many claims about hemp, so it is possible someone, somewhere, sometime, said it. But I have not seen it in any original source.""Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois State University and author of Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry, agreed that ""it doesn't sound right. This was a time in our nation's history when trees were abundant, and I'd be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper.""Ten other experts told PolitiFact that they had never heard of this claim, had never seen it persuasively documented, or both.""I have read Bulletin 404 carefully and can see no such claim,"" said Samuel Thayer, an expert in edible wild plants, author of The Forager’s Harvest, and creator of the Hemphoax.org website, which casts doubt on a wide variety of claims by hemp advocates. ""It is possible the source is something else, but since I have not seen the claim referenced to any document in particular, and I know of no other USDA document regarding hemp from that year, that is my working hypothesis about where it came from.""Our rulingThe Facebook post said that ""in 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down.""The most plausible source for this -- Bulletin 404 -- is silent on this claim, and neither our own research nor any of the dozen experts we asked was able to come up with a definitive source. As with all claims of this type, it’s impossible to prove a negative, so we are willing to re-rate this claim if credible evidence emerges. However, our best efforts have turned up nothing more than a puff of smoke. Since the claim is unsupported, we rate it False.","http://www.jackherer.com/thebook/,https://archive.org/details/1916UsdaBulletin404.pdfWww.hempology.orgPrime4uWww.psywar.org,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,http://www.votehemp.com/PDF/HEMP_Yearbook_of_Agriculture_1913.pdf,http://hemphoax.org/",,"National,Drugs,Marijuana,Facebook posts",,,,,
369,,,,true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/jan/12/paul-ryan/do-members-military-unlike-other-federal-employees/,"Members of the military don’t ""contribute toward their pension.""",,politifact,,"House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has drawn some praise -- but also fire, especially from veterans -- for co-brokering a federal budget deal that includes smaller pension payments for younger military retirees.The two-year agreement reached by Ryan and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., became law in December 2013.To help reduce the deficit, pensions for those who retire from the military before age 62 won’t be as large. Those younger retirees will receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to their pensions that are 1 percent lower than the rate of inflation (full COLAs will continue to be given to  military retirees who are over 62).In defending the move, Ryan made a claim about military pensions that we want to check.""Civilian public employees have a 401(k) with the match, a defined-benefit pension and health care. They don't have (pension) COLAs at all if they retire before the age of 62. And they do contribute some to their pensions, and now we're having (newly hired employees) contribute more,"" the Janesville Republican told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board Dec. 19, 2013.""The military doesn't contribute toward their pension. They don't have a paycheck – payroll deduction -- toward their pensions. And they do have a COLA before they're 62.""With more public employees -- notably state and local government workers in Wisconsin -- contributing more toward the cost of their benefits, we wondered if Ryan was right.Do members of the military contribute nothing toward their pensions?Evolution of military pensionsMilitary pensions have expanded in scope since the first national pension law was passed in 1776, in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. At that time, pensions were strictly for those ""losing a limb in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a livelihood.""Over the next several decades, pensions were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans based on need and later they became full pay for life, regardless of need.In 1948, 20 years was established as the minimum requirement for voluntary retirement for the Army and Air Force, putting those services on par with the Navy. Since 1986, military pensions have been ""inflation protected,"" with annual cost-of-living adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index.The military retirement system now provides some $52 billion per year in pension payments to more than 2 million military retirees and their survivors.(By the way, pensions for civilian federal employees were created in 1920. Social Security was created in 1935.)At the individual level, members of the military are guaranteed a specific monthly pension payment after 20 or more years of service. However, it is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition: Those who serve at least 20 years are fully vested, but those who leave the military earlier usually receive no retirement benefits. Only 17 percent of those who serve in the military end up getting a retirement benefit, according to the Defense Business Board and the House Budget Committee.But, as Ryan indicated in his comments, military retirees begin receiving their monthly pension payments immediately, regardless of age. So, many begin drawing military pensions in their early to mid-40s, often while working in another career. Other public-sector employees, and those in the private sector, typically do not begin receiving an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65.Pension contributionsSo, what about contributions toward pensions? In other words, where does the money for the military retirement checks come from?A Congressional Budget Office report and a Department of Defense report cited by Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert say members of the military make no contribution toward their pensions.So does a report we found from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And, Andrew Biggs, a public employee retirement expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us the same.That contrasts with all other federal employees (including civilian employees in the military). They contribute a portion of their pay toward pensions; the rates mainly depend on when they were hired.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021Here’s a breakdown of pension contributions, according to data we collected from the Congressional Research Service, the federal Office of Personnel Management and the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, which advocates for pay and benefits for federal employees.Type of federal employeePercentage of pay contributed by employee Percentage of pay contributed by employer Military personnel041.8Civilian, hired before 1984*719**Civilian, hired 1984-20120.811.9Civilian, hired in 20133.19.6Civilian, hired in 20144.49.6*Generally do not pay into or receive Social Security; employees hired after 1984 pay 6.2% toward Social Security.**An aggregate figure.

Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H) for her support of law. The ad introduces an unnamed family whose insurance plan was canceled, and the sick husband can’t go to his doctors because their new plan doesn’t offer access to the same doctors and hospitals.Shea-Porter swiftly called the ad false in a statement to media.""Washington Republicans should take down their misleading attack ads and stop frightening Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem, because they can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals,"" she said.The statement went on to say that the congresswoman had already worked with Anthem representatives to extend the company’s renewal deadline for individual policyholders so they’d have access to same network in 2014.   Shea-Porter also repeated the comment about individuals having access to the same doctors and hospitals next year in a press release a few days later.We’ve checked several versions of the ""if you like your policy, you can keep it"" statement from a variety of sources.But we wondered whether individual policyholders in New Hampshire would have access to the same doctors and hospitals next year, especially in light of an Anthem announcement in September that individuals on the state’s new marketplace would have access to only 16 of the state’s 26 hospitals.A Brief BackgroundPresident Obama promised many times when promoting his new health care law that policyholders who liked their insurance plans wouldn’t have to change.Old plans were supposed to be protected through a system called grandfathering, basically allowing plans to continue as long as they met certain requirements.Those rules were so strict, though, that very few plans could meet them. And so Obama’s promise came back to bite him when an estimated 4 million cancellation letters went out earlier this fall.For damage control, in November the White House announced that insurance providers and state insurance commissioners could extend current plans, even if they didn’t meet the minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act.The situation in New HampshireFeatured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021In the following weeks, New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny was one of several state commissioners who said the state would allow renewal of non-compliant plans.But for Granite Staters with individually purchased insurance plans, renewal was already an option.Under New Hampshire law, policyholders are allowed to renew an existing policy earlier than its anniversary date.  Anthem publicized this option in a release the day after Obama’s announcement, saying the company had sent notices to individual policyholders to remind them of this choice.""We wanted to underscore that our previously announced early renewal option, which has proven to be very popular among our members, already gives individual policyholders who wish to keep their existing policy a way to do so,"" Lisa Guertin, president of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in New Hampshire, said in the release.Anthem is by far the predominant insurance company in New Hampshire. It’s the only company participating in the state’s marketplace in 2014 and holds about 30,000 individual policies in the state. Other companies hold around 1,000, according to the N.H. Insurance Department.The NRCC ad that Shea-Porter was responding to said that one-third of the state’s hospitals weren’t covered under the Affordable Care Act. That’s true in a sense -- Anthem’s individual plans for sale on the state’s new insurance marketplace offer a ""narrow network"" that excludes 10 of the state’s 26 hospitals.Yet a company spokesman confirmed that those who renewed their existing plans before the deadline would have access to the same network of providers, including those 10 hospitals, for 12 more months.  At the end of November, the insurance company extended its deadline for the early renewal option for a second time, giving policyholders until Dec. 16 to renew their canceled plans. That would have given them a policy year of Dec. 1, 2013, to Nov. 30, 2014.Our RulingShea-Porter said in December that in 2014 ""Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem… can indeed renew their policies and keep their doctors and hospitals.""New Hampshire policyholders were always able to extend their current policies 12 months, thanks to the state’s early renewal option. Anthem will not extend canceled policies after its Dec. 16 deadline, despite the White House allowing extensions until October 2014.That means that Shea-Porter’s statement was accurate when she said it, though it no longer applies today, since the renewal deadline has passed.But individual policyholders did have a chance to keep their same network of hospitals and doctors next year. Not everyone may have done so, which means some people may be forced to see other doctors at different hospitals.In New Hampshire, at least, people were given that opportunity.  We rate this statement True.","http://www.nrcc.org/2013/12/10/nrcc-radio-ad-thats-new-hampshire-promised/,http://shea-porter.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/shea-porter-spokesperson-statement-on-misleading-radio-ads,http://shea-porter.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/hea-porter-announces-additional-health-insurer-to-enter-new-hampshire,https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/about-us/pressreleasedetails/NH/2013/1404,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/14/statement-president-affordable-care-act,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/,https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/about-us/pressreleasedetails/NH/2013/1505",,"New Hampshire,Health Care,Carol Shea-Porter",,,,,

Through lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, Roberts provided this statement:""My reference to marketing referred to our advertisements for the lottery. I was not referring to our responsible gambling ads, where we believe it helps to show people gambling in order to demonstrate what responsible gambling means. Even these ads mainly show side shots of the machines and do not portray players winning a jackpot or celebrating their winnings. My statement was in response to accusations that we run ads glorifying gambling in order to attract more players. In fact, we do not.""We called Jeff Marotta, who works with problem gamblers and who, until recently, belonged to a lottery advisory group.Marotta, president and senior consultant at Problem Gambling Solutions, said he had seen the ""kayaking and motorcycling"" ad on television for the first time the night before. However, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen the ad. He saw it in September, when lottery officials asked him to critique new responsible-gambling ads showing people playing ""VLTs,"" -- or video lottery terminals.""The images in the final segment of these ads show men playing VLTs with attractive women by their sides, smiling at the man and the machine,"" Marotta wrote to lottery officials in a memo dated Sept. 25, 2013. ""The message that VLTs are fun and attractive are further accentuated by the peppy music, announcer tone, choice of actors, association with cool activities…""He ended the memo by writing, ""In sum, these responsible gambling ads could be viewed as wolves in sheep’s clothing and in my opinion should not be aired.""Marotta told us his long-term contract to advise lottery officials was terminated soon after. ""Was it this that burned my bridge with them?"" he said. ""Maybe. I’ll never know for sure.""Roberts, in a follow-up email, noted that he became director after Marotta’s departure as a consultant. He added, ""Our advertisements about responsible gambling are in fulfillment of our obligation to operate the lottery in a manner commensurate with the public interest.""He did not elaborate on his earlier claim that the ads don’t show people playing or winning video games. But Baumann, in a later phone conversation, said Roberts had not seen the website-only video at the time of his OPB comments.It’s true that Roberts had been on the job less than two weeks when he made the statement on OPB and understandable that he had not seen one of the ads. The lottery has many ads, and the website has many pages.The kayaking ad is more problematic. The Oregon Lottery does classify it as a ""responsible gambling"" ad. But Roberts, on OPB, said of lottery marketing: ""We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games."" He didn’t mention a distinction. Neither would that distinction be clear to viewers.And as Marotta noted, the ad -- showing young, attractive people having a great time -- would be unlikely to dissuade people from gambling.Finally, despite Roberts’ statement on OPB, even the kayaking ad clearly shows people not only playing but enthusiastically smiling and reacting to an apparent win. We find Roberts’ statement False.","/personalities/its-still-bad-idea/,/factchecks/2012/sep/11/its-still-bad-idea/would-proposed-casino-wood-village-be-countrys-lar/",,"Oregon,Gambling,Jack Roberts",,,,,

John Cornyn in the 2014 Republican primary says Cornyn is vulnerable from the right.In a Dec. 10, 2013, blog post on his campaign website, Steve Stockman of Friendswood specified: ""In every poll liberal John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.""Calling Cornyn liberal is questionable, though we see that as Stockman’s opinion and not something that we could put to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Suffice to say that Cornyn came out as the Senate’s second-least liberal and second-most conservative member in a February 2013 vote analysis by National Journal magazine.We turned instead to whether every poll shows Cornyn losing re-election to ""any conservative the voters have heard about.""Voter pollsUnfortunately, we failed to hear back from Stockman as we weighed the results of three fall 2013 voter polls testing Cornyn for re-election against particular possible Republican foes.An October 2013 poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune showed Cornyn leading at 39 percent against two little-known opponents, Dwayne Stovall and Erick Wyatt. Forty-eight percent of respondents had no opinion.On Nov. 14, 2013, UT government lecturer Jim Henson, one of the pollsters, wrote for the Tribune that this was ""by no means a forceful showing for an incumbent senator in a state as red as Texas, and has further fueled whispers of a primary challenge."" Elaborating by email, Henson told us Cornyn saw his voter favorability ratings among Texas conservatives drop through the summer, ""which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right.""Neither Stovall or Wyatt was widely known when the poll was taken, Henson said.Per Stockmn’s focus on Republicans Texans had ""heard about,"" Henson offered: ""I think it would roughly be fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have ‘heard about.’""Two polls to go.In early November 2013, a survey taken by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling indicated Cornyn was not the favorite of 388 past Republican primary voters, who by 49 percent to 33 percent indicated they would prefer a more conservative nominee.That poll also showed Cornyn ahead in hypothetical one-on-one faceoffs with two party figures and trailing another hypothetical challenger. According to a Nov. 6, 2013, press release on the results, Cornyn ran ahead of Biblical historian David Barton, former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, by 51 percent to 18 percent, and led U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, by 40 percent to 31 percent.The poll also asked about a hypothetical matchup between Cornyn and Gov. Rick Perry. The result: Perry drew 46 percent to Cornyn’s 35 percent. (Perry, of course, is not challenging Cornyn and has, in fact, endorsed him.)By email, PPP spokesman Tom Jensen noted that 38 percent of the polled voters had an opinion of Gohmert. Jensen said the firm did not poll on Barton’s name recognition, ""but it doubtless would have been lower.""Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Jensen wrote: ""My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition,"" meaning half or more of the voters recognize the candidate’s name. ""Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman’s statement might be true at some level but it’s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn’t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with.""Next, Jensen pointed us to an Oct. 26, 2013, poll by Human Events and Florida-based Gravis Marketing indicating that a generic ""Tea Party"" candidate, unnamed, would lead Cornyn among Republicans by 46 percent to 33 percent, according to a Gravis Marketing summary. The poll involved 563 Republicans, the firm said, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.According to the summary, Cornyn led several hypothetical one-on-one races--including versus Stockman. The summary says Cornyn led Gohmert in its polls by 45 percent to 20 percent and ran ahead of Stockman, 41 percent to 15 percent.But Cornyn trailed in a one-on-one matchup with U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who has run for president several times, 44 percent to 34 percent, the summary states.We wondered about a seeming conflict in the Gravis results: Cornyn outpacing Rafael Cruz, whose son, Ted, is the junior senator from Texas, by 39 percent to 33 percent, in their hypothetical one-on-one matchup yet in a later poll result, the elder Cruz leading Cornyn, Paul and Stockman in a hypothetical four-way primary.The latter question was: ""If the Republican primary were held today, would you vote for Cornyn, Cruz, Paul or Stockman?"" The results: Cruz, 41 percent, Cornyn at 25 percent, Paul at 18 percent and Stockman at 3 percent.By telephone, the president of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan, told us he suspects some poll respondents answering the four-way question thought they were considering a Ted Cruz candidacy against Cornyn rather than a race involving his father, with the erroneous effect being a boost to the elder Cruz’s poll standing. ""I’m not confident with the way we worded that question,"" Kaplan said.Cornyn’s objectionTo our inquiry, Cornyn’s Senate campaign disputed Stockman’s website statement.By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out that no one leading Cornyn  in the three polls was shown as attracting more than half the vote--in other words, winning the nomination outright.On another front, Brandewie maintained that Texas Republicans have ""heard about"" the two candidates bested by Cornyn in the UT/Tribune poll as well as Barton, Gohmert and the elder Cruz, each of whom did not lead Cornyn in the polled one-on-one matchups.Our rulingStockman said: ""In every poll,"" John Cornyn ""always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.""In Stockman's favor, recent polling suggests Cornyn trailing Perry and Paul, two well-known Republicans, in hypothetical one-on-one matches.But polls also have shown Cornyn running ahead of Barton, Gohmert and Stockman. These Texans are almost certainly less known than Paul and Perry, both of whom ran for president. Yet Gohmert and Stockman are members of Congress and Barton has long been a grass-roots leader. We think it reasonable to consider each one a conservative that ""voters have heard about,"" which makes Stockman’s statement False.FALSE – The statement is not accurate.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","http://stockman2014.com/articles/i-m-running-for-senate-against-liberal-john-cornyn,http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-vote-ratings/how-liberal-is-your-senator-2012-vote-ratings-20130221,http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/11_1_1.html,https://laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/poll/features/201310_GOP_senatorial/slide1.html,https://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/government/faculty/hensonjr,https://www.texastribune.org/2013/11/14/polling-center-cornyn-and-cruz-effect/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SNFvPvf4ZYqVy4Bh2dQXBI_k2NOVl_-fnvB51Hpd9gs/pub,http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2013/PPP_Release_TX_1106.pdf,http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2013/PPP_Release_TX_1106.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/david-barton/,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/,http://gravismarketing.com/gravis-marketing-poll-ivr/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/",,"Polls and Public Opinion,Texas,Steve Stockman",,,,,

Young adults are generally in better health and are needed to balance out risk among other, older enrollees, and they’re disproportionately uninsured.On NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, host David Gregory asked if ""the lag effect"" of the struggling federal marketplace will deter young adults from signing up for insurance.Washington Post Wonkblog editor Ezra Klein said the Obama administration was planning to deploy a vast marketing campaign to encourage young people to sign up through their preferred TV shows, social networks and parents, but the effort was not fully rolled out as problems with Healthcare.gov persisted.Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and former health care adviser in the Obama administration, pointed to a microcosm of success in California, where the state-based exchange is ""working well enough.""""And there, the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population,"" Emanuel said. ""And so it does appear that we are going to have enough when you look at that data point. And if we can get the word out, I think Ezra is right, we'll get enough young people.""California’s enrollment figures were described as ""a rare bright spot"" by the New York Times amid dismal reports about the federal marketplace. We wanted to dig in a little more and find out if Emanuel is right that young adults are signing up as a proportion to the population in California.Several experts we reached were initially thrown by Emanuel’s use of ""kids."" Emanuel clarified he was referring to news about young adult sign-ups from Covered California, the state’s health insurance exchange, in a brief interview. (He added that he has an almost 30-year-old ""kid."")Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, distributed a Nov. 21 press release that pointed out 18- to 34-year-olds applied ""in direct proportion to California’s population"" in October.That age group comprised about 22.5 percent, or about 6,900, of the people who selected plans during October and were not eligible for Medicaid. In 2010, the same group comprised about 21 percent of the state’s population. The last two columns from the following Covered California chart illustrate the point.The gap widens if you tinker with different data. Young adults comprise 25 percent of the state’s population using 2012 data from the American Community Survey, and about 27 percent if you take out the 65-and-over population, which is eligible for Medicare, according to the California Health Interview Survey 2011-12 data.So, we’re all finished here, right? Well, hold on.For one thing, experts said it’s way too early to draw sweeping conclusions from the state’s first month of data. November data, unavailable until mid December, could tell a very different tale. The real meaningful test will be how many young adults sign up long-term.""People talk about these numbers because we have them, but you can't extrapolate from these,"" said Glenn Melnick, a University of Southern California health policy professor.Then there’s another matter of Covered California, and Emanuel, spinning the data in a way that emits positivity but, experts say, is not exactly relevant.Instead of comparing the percentage of young adult enrollees to their share of the population, some said it would be better to compare those signups to young adults’ share of the uninsured population, which is about 40 percent, several experts said.""They need it proportionate to the target population, which is the uninsured,"" Melnick said.Another issue with comparing to a share of the population: The marketplaces established by the health care law are not really intended for the nation’s youngest and oldest residents. Children who receive coverage because of the law are getting it mainly through expanded Medicaid offerings, and adults over 65 are eligible for Medicare. That means comparisons could be misleading.Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021""So that’s not to say that they are completely off the table, but they are by design expected to be less represented in the enrollment in Covered California than their presence in the population,"" said Marian Mulkey, director of the California Healthcare Foundation’s Health Reform and Public Programs Initiative.Using 2011 Current Population Survey data, the foundation determined that 41 percent of the state’s uninsured population under age 65 is between the ages of 18 and 34. Since one of the goals of the law is to get more people in this group insured, you’d want to see young adult signups go higher than just their share of the overall population, she said.""I would submit that that’s not quite a high enough bar for what they should be aiming for,"" she said of measuring the signups against the overall population. ""I would hasten to say that this is very early data, it doesn’t mean that they won’t get there.""Gail Wilensky, the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that measuring sign-ups of young adults against the percentage of uninsured young adult Californians would be the more relevant statistic.""This might not look quite so good as the percent of the population since this group is disproportionately uninsured,"" Wilensky said.Still, Dylan Roby, a UCLA School of Public Health assistant professor of health services, disagreed with the idea of the uninsured population being a better benchmark. In California, he said, the risk pool for plans sold on the individual market, both within the exchange and outside of it, is the same. Plus, he said people who sign up for insurance early are likely to be those who already have it but were not previously eligible for subsidies on the exchange.""So, given that we don’t have numbers on how many 18-34 year olds are signing up for coverage outside of the exchange with the same consumer protections, deductible limits, out-of-pocket maximums, etc., I am not sure you can make any statement about the magnitude of sign-ups and response to the new plans,"" he said.Roby said his target would be for 35-40 percent of people signed up on the individual market (through Covered California or on their own) to be between the ages of 18 and 34 at the end of open enrollment. More than 2 million uninsured Californians are 18-34 years old.Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, struck a similar chord, saying neither view of the percentage of young adult enrollments -- whether compared to their share of the state population or of the uninsured population -- is necessarily germane.""Neither one really tells you what we should expect to see if young adults were participating in proportion to their share of the overall target population for the exchange,"" she said. ""That’s what feels relevant to me.""Many uninsured young adults actually look like they’re eligible for Medicaid, she said. So just looking at the percentage of those who are signing up for exchange coverage against the overall uninsured population doesn’t tell the full story.She added that enrollment estimates broken down by age group are hard to come by, and ""I haven’t myself tried to calculate that particular target.""A Nov. 20 Reuters story that analyzed early data from state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington and Maryland said ""so far more than 20 percent of the 23,500 combined enrollees in private insurance plans are 18 to 34 years old, ranging from about 19 percent in Kentucky and Connecticut to about 27 percent in Maryland."" Other state-run exchanges, such as New York and Hawaii (and D.C.), have not released enrollment data by demographic.The early turnout among young adults is encouraging, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group focused on enrolling young adults into coverage, in an interview. ""We anticipate that we’ll see a broader surge in young people as they get more educated.""Several of those states reported an uptick in enrollments in the early weeks of November, including California.Our rulingEmanuel tried to point to a good sign for the health care law in California, saying ""the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population.""The statement is pretty accurate for young adults for the month of October. But it is a curious statistic. Health policy experts said the stat is misleading because the entire California population is not supposed to access the marketplace. They offered more apt comparisons that relate more closely to the uninsured population and alter the figures.The more important takeaway is that it’s very early to draw significant conclusions about California’s performance and what it could mean for a functional Healthcare.gov after its first month.We rate Emanuel’s claim Half True.","https://healthcare.gov,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/ezekiel-emanuel/,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/business/california-encouraged-by-health-plan-enrollment.html?hp&_r=0,https://coveredcanews.blogspot.com/2013/11/rate-of-applications-completed-nearly.html,/personalities/greg-kelly/,/factchecks/2021/feb/09/greg-kelly/newsmax-host-falsely-claims-only-one-person-died-c/,http://www.chcf.org/~/media/MEDIA%20LIBRARY%20Files/PDF/C/PDF%20CaliforniaUninsured2012.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/20/us-usa-healthcare-enrollment-idUSBRE9AJ09220131120,http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/18/nation/la-na-obamacare-increase-20131119#axzz2l6We1VOM%20http://,https://healthcare.gov",,"Health Care,PunditFact,Ezekiel Emanuel",,,,,

We’re not early-risers like the Army. We embarked on a mission to determine whether the senator was correct that the military was conducting research on these serious conditions and whether his math was correct about how much in taxpayer dollars it was spending on such work.In late 1992, Congress began to set aside annual funding toward research of various illnesses and diseases to be done by the Defense Department. Some of the research is for conditions that appeared directly related to the battlefield, such as Gulf War Illness and traumatic brain injuries. Other research is for conditions faced by Americans that are not necessarily military-related. The list of conditions includes, as Chambliss noted, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.As Chambliss told it, the now-deceased Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican, asked for some prostate cancer research dollars to be allocated to the Defense Department. Chambliss said Stevens later realized those funds should be allocated to the NIH.We looked up the most recent funding totals for the various forms of research. The Defense Department Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs website said $80 million was spent in fiscal year 2013 on prostate cancer research, but the totals were slightly less for the other forms of cancer Chambliss mentioned. The website said $20 million was spent on ovarian cancer research and $120 million on breast cancer research in FY 2013. The 2013 federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2012, and ended Sept. 30.Lauren Claffey, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, said he was using numbers for fiscal year 2010.To sum up, Chambliss said the federal government gives the U.S. Department of Defense $80 million a year for prostate cancer research, $25 million a year for ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year for breast cancer research.

Scott Brown took a stroll down memory lane Monday while talking about the health care law with Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson.Brown, who is now a Fox News contributor, claimed the architects of Obamacare delayed Brown’s swearing-in in 2010 to help ""ram"" the law through Congress.""They rammed it through before I got there, knowing I would be there in a week or two,"" Brown said on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. ""They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram it through and did not pass one amendment to make it better for the American people, and they should be held accountable.""As Brown finished his point about his swearing-in, people watching could hear Carlson say, ""I remember.""But did she remember right?Brown was elected in a 2010 special election to finish the term of the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy. When Kennedy died on Aug. 25, 2009, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick appointed a Democrat, Paul Kirk, to hold his seat. State law requires a special election for federal seats to be held between 145 and 160 days of when the vacancy occurred -- or in the case of Kennedy’s seat somewhere between Jan. 17, 2010, and Feb. 1, 2010.Massachusetts’ election was Jan. 19, 2010, the first Tuesday in that window. Brown, who had campaigned on being the 41st vote against the health care legislation, defeated Democrat Martha Coakley by a vote of 52 percent to 47 percent.Brown’s victory did not mean he could just move to Capitol Hill and start casting votes the next day. Brown was sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, 16 days after his election.Was his swearing-in ceremony delayed?No.Cities and towns in Massachusetts have 15 days to send final results to the Massachusetts Secretary of State, including a 10-day window for counting absentee and overseas ballots.""It wasn’t delayed,"" said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin. ""This process had to be done.""Featured Fact-checkGreg Kellystated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment“Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.By Bill McCarthy • February 9, 2021In fact, Brown was sworn in a week earlier than he had planned, according to media reports. After receiving criticism of his ""three-week victory lap"" from a newspaper columnist, he wrote state officials asking for his election results to be certified immediately. The results were certified by the governor’s council and sent to the U.S. Senate ""as soon as the ink was dry,"" McNiff said.Meanwhile, on Capitol HillSo if anything, Brown’s swearing-in actually came a week earlier than originally planned. But what about the Democrats in Washington? Did they scramble to pass health care reform before Brown took his seat?Again, no.Weeks before Brown’s election, the Senate had already passed its version of health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on Dec. 24, 2009, on a 60-39 vote. (Kirk voted yes.)But the legislation needed to pass the House, and House Democratic leaders wanted to make changes that echoed their priorities. Problem was, any big changes to the Senate bill would send it back to the upper chamber for final approval, where the 39 Republicans and the newly elected Brown could now filibuster the bill.Top Democrats wondered what to do. One option widely reported before Brown’s election was to pass the health care law before Brown took his seat. But on Jan. 20, 2010, the day after Brown’s election, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nv., took that plan off the table.""We’re going to wait until the new senator arrives until we do anything more on health care,"" Reid said.In the end, the House passed the Senate bill on March 21, 2010. On that same day, the House passed a slew of their own measures in a separate bill, which the Senate passed March 25, 2010, through a filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation.One last point: Brown’s 16-day wait from election to swearing-in is in line with other recent Senate special elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was elected after the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg on Oct. 16, 2013, and sworn in 15 days later on Oct. 31, 2013. And Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey won the special election to replace John Kerry on June 25, 2013, and did not take the oath of office until July 16, 2013 -- 21 days later.Our rulingBrown said, ""They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through.""We never heard back from Brown, but the record is pretty clear on this.

Their health insurance plans are locked in, completely immune to new rules set forth by the Affordable Care Act, he said, noting that everyday Americans being hit with cancellation notices from their insurers don’t get the same courtesy.""If your plan is the result of collective bargaining, no subsequent changes by anybody -- insurance companies, Obamacare -- can force your grandfathered policy to change,"" Limbaugh said about the union carve-out on his show Oct. 30.""So, in other words, union insurers can amend their coverage. Your insurance company can't,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Well, your insurance company can, but you lose your grandfathered status when they do. Unions don't because they're covered under an amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.""Limbaugh’s commentary leans on a Human Events column by Betsy McCaughey, the former New York lieutenant governor who once claimed that ""Obamacare will question your sex life.""We contacted several experts of the health care law, as well as unions, and they agreed: The law does contain a special rule for some union-negotiated health plans, but it’s not a permanent guarantee of grandfather status. It was a temporary rule aimed to create a smooth transition to the new law without breaking collectively bargained contracts across the country.You may be wondering about all this ""grandfather"" talk in the news lately, and why people are so dad-gum angry about it. We’ll back up a little bit.We discussed grandfathered plans, the fight du jour in the ongoing health care wars, at length in this fact-check. Basically, a health plan purchased by an individual or through an employer may be ""grandfathered"" if it existed before the Affordable Care Act became law March 23, 2010, and has not significantly changed since.The insurers offering these old plans have to follow some parts of the new law, such as covering adult children up to age 26, but they can largely keep these plans as they are without making many of the bigger changes required of new plans, such as fully covering preventive care.That said, the plan can lose its grandfathered status if the insurer makes a tweak that is considered too drastic by the federal government. For example, a plan can lose its grandfathered status if copayments go up by at least $5 plus medical inflation or if an employer decreases its contribution rate by more than five percentage points for a group plan. There’s a lot of fine print, and you can read it all courtesy of the breezy Federal Register.A plan that loses its grandfathered status is headed for certain death.There’s your need-to-know background info. So where do unions come in already?Here’s where: The same section of the Affordable Care Act that talks about grandfathered policies also talks about plans agreed to through collective bargaining (section 1251 (d) on page 56).The lawmakers who wrote this provision were not thinking of those of us without law degrees when they wrote it, so here’s the PunditFact translation: Workers whose health benefits are provided through an insurance company and were included in a collective bargaining agreement ratified before March 23, 2010, can keep their plan no matter the changes -- but not for long.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021The plan is only automatically grandfathered until the termination date of the agreement.So they do receive different treatment, but only until the agreement expires. After that, the plan must meet the same requirements of all other grandfathered plans.And importantly, none of this applies to collectively bargained plans for self-insured employers, which comprise more than half of union plans. Union-negotiated self-insured plans operate like all other companies.""This isn’t some huge gift which is being handed to the union,"" said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University law professor. ""It’s simply recognizing that if you have coverage under a collective bargaining agreement, as long as that collective bargaining agreement remains in place, that coverage is okay.""Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, sounded a similar chord, saying ""to me, that’s not unreasonable"" because the alternative is prying open existing agreements to satisfy the health care law.A union plan could keep its grandfathered status after the expiration date of the agreement as long as ""no changes were made since March 23, 2010, that would have otherwise caused the plan to lose its grandfathered status,"" according to the University of California Berkeley Labor Center.In other words, union plans could lose their grandfathered status once the agreement expires if they reduce benefits in ways that are at odds with the health care law, just like all other grandfathered plans, said Randy G. DeFrehn, National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans executive director.""The statement that collectively bargained plans cannot lose their grandfather status is not correct,"" he said.Experts told us most union agreements last between three to five years, which means most of those plans are already being treated like other grandfathered plans because the agreements that were in place before the health care law passed have expired.""It’s a really narrow exception,"" said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law. ""This is kind of coming to an end anyway.""The law says these plans can be adjusted to comply with the Affordable Care Act without breaking the union agreement.Our rulingLimbaugh takes a point about real language inserted in the health care law for some union-negotiated health care plans and twists the truth.These plans are only grandfathered for as long as the collective bargaining agreement lasts. After the agreement expires, and some already have, those plans are held to the same standards as all other grandfathered plans.Limbaugh's suggestion that ""no subsequent changes by anybody"" can change the union plans goes too far. On top of that, union-negotiated self-insured plans (which make up more than half of all union plans) are treated no differently than regular employer plans.We rate Limbaugh's claim Mostly False.","http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/10/30/carve_out_union_plans_grandfathered,http://www.humanevents.com/2013/10/30/a-lie-from-day-one/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/19/betsy-mccaughey/betsy-mccaughey-says-obamacare-will-question-your-/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/30/valerie-jarrett/valerie-jarrett-says-nothing-obamacare-forces-peop/,https://webapps.dol.gov/federalregister/PdfDisplay.aspx?DocId=23967,http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/healthpolicy/acaguide12.pdf",,"Health Care,Unions,PunditFact,Rush Limbaugh",,,,,

This transformed this neighborhood, and today it is a downtown neighborhood considered to be one of the most desirable in the nation. These neighborhoods, and the people of color in them, have made lemonade out of the lemon(s) despite a historic racism that has endured for almost 90 years. The result is that 78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country.""Defining gentrificationWe know 78702; it’s the inner-city region roughly bounded by Lady Bird Lake to the south, Interstate Highway 35 to the west, Airport Boulevard to the east and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north.And it’s the nation’s second-most what?Merriam-Webster defines gentrify as ""to change (a place, such as an old neighborhood) by improving it and making it more appealing to people who have money."" Gentrification, it says, is the ""process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents.""No doubt, that’s happening in some of Austin’s core neighborhoods, driven in East Austin near the lake by what a May 18, 2011, American-Statesman news story described as a demographic transformation. ""The number of African Americans residing in Central East Austin -- once considered the epicenter of black and brown life in Central Texas -- shrank by 27 percent during the past decade,"" the story said, ""while the number of whites living there increased by 40 percent, and whites surpassed blacks as the second-largest racial or ethnic group.""African Americans or Hispanics still hold a majority or plurality in most East Austin census tracts,"" the story said. ""But white residents had become the majority in two of the tracts by 2010.""The story said the Hispanic population in Central East Austin also fell -- by 9.3 percent -- during the period, according to the newspaper’s analysis of 2010 census data for 20 tracts roughly bounded by Interstate 35, the lake, U.S. 290 East and U.S. 183. ""The population shifts occurred as a development boom accelerated during the last half of the decade, attracting new residents into predominantly low-income, minority neighborhoods for myriad reasons, including the relatively low property prices there, proximity to downtown and something talked about a lot in Austin: quality of life,"" the story said.Finally, the story noted that discussions of gentrification often are cast against the legacy of the city's 1928 master plan, which segregated blacks to neighborhoods east of what is now I-35, ""creating a painful hard-line history of inequities between east and west, whites and minorities.""Charting increases in white residentsLlanes told us that a chart produced by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a charity focused on education policy, was the basis of the 78702 claim.According to the chart, from 2000 to 2010, the 78702 ZIP code trailed only a Tennessee ZIP code for its increase in white residents. According to the chart, dated June 14, 2012, neighborhoods in 78702 saw a 33 percentage point increase in white residents —  going from 23 percent of the ZIP code’s residents in 2000 to 56 percent in 2010. And that surge, the chart says, trailed only the 39 percentage point increase in white residents of Chattanooga’s 37408 ZIP code. In the decade, 78702 saw an overall population decrease of 5 percent, the chart says.And is the surge in white residents proof that 78702 was No. 2 in gentrification?Not according to the chart’s creator, Michael Petrilli, who said in a June 2012 blog post accompanying a revision of his original chart that his breakdown should not be taken as identifying ZIP codes with the greatest gentrification.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021In his initial chart, dated June 11, 2013, Petrilli said he ""equated ‘gentrification’ with a significant increase in the white share of a neighborhood’s population. In my defense, I did admit that looking at the numbers by race was far from perfect—gentrification is a socio-economic issue—but census income data by (ZIP) code are not yet available for 2010. Still, I chose to use the ‘gentrification’ word, and it’s reasonable to point out its inaccuracy.""More recently, Petrilli told us by telephone that surges in white residents are ""obviously a very imperfect proxy"" for gentrification.Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer, replied to our inquiry about 78702 by saying in an email that gentrification is ""way more complex than simple rapid racial change. It really has far more to do with the displacement of lower-income households by higher-income households, regardless of race, resulting in a fundamental change in the character of the neighborhood.""""But for sure, without question, 78702, or at least certain parts of 78702, are indeed gentrifying,"" Robinson wrote. He added that the ""hard parts to measure are the velocity and spatial extent of gentrification.""78702 by changes in median income and other prosperity indicatorsSeeking better ways of gauging the gentrification of 78702, we solicited breakdowns of U.S. Census Bureau data from American-Statesman data editor Christian McDonald; Lloyd Potter, the demographer for the state of Texas; and Elizabeth Mueller, a University of Texas associate professor of architecture.Mueller checked changes in the number of residents living at two times the federal poverty level in the 25 urban ZIP codes that were identified by Petrilli as experiencing the biggest bumps in white residents. She emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that between the 2000 Census and the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest five years of its American Community Survey, taken from 2007 through 2011, the 78702 ZIP code had a 17 percentage point decrease in families living at or below two times the federal poverty level. That placed the ZIP code 12th among the 25 ZIP codes pulled from Petrilli’s list, Mueller said.Potter compiled median household incomes for the nation’s ZIP codes in 1999 and compared them with such incomes as gauged by the latest five years of the bureau’s community surveys. McDonald then helped us focus on how much such incomes changed in ZIP codes with 10,000 residents or more. The result: 78702, home to nearly 20,700 residents in 2011, saw a 12 percentage point improvement in median household income between the 2000 census and the latest five community surveys; it ranked about 300th in such growth among the 1,700 populous ZIP codes that similarly saw increases.Potter also compared the share of residents in ZIP codes in 1999 living at or below the federal poverty level with the share of residents who lived at or below poverty in 2011. According to a spreadsheet he emailed us analyzing the rates in counties home in 2000 to metropolitan areas of 1 million residents or more, 29.4 percent of the residents of the 78702 ZIP code lived in poverty in 1999; the level was 27.2 percent in 2011. The difference of 2.2 percentage points ranked the 78702 ZIP code about 2,000th nationally for its reduction.McDonald, drawing on census data, compared the median value of single-family homes. His spreadsheet indicated that, unadjusted for inflation, this factor in the 78702 ZIP code was up 192 percent, more than $100,000, between the 2000 census and five latest community surveys. This change in value, by percentage, placed the ZIP code 64th among ZIP codes home to 10,000 residents or more, according to the spreadsheet.Definitely gentrifying, but...Finally, we talked through our statistical breakouts with Mueller. She said by phone that while some of the indicators were not ideal for gauging gentrification--changes in residents living at or below the poverty level largely reflects people in public housing, she suggested--a reasonable upshot of our foray is the 78702 ZIP code is ""not the second-most anything"" nationally in terms of gentrification.""But is this area gentrifying? It is. In Austin, it’s definitely one of the areas experiencing the most dramatic change,"" Mueller said. ""Gentrification is generally about several issues. It’s about displacement of low-income people, its about changing the character of a community, sometimes physically and socially, and it means loss of community voice. Right now, we’re losing low-income residents (in 78702). It’s up for grabs about (losses of) community character and community voice.""Our rulingLlanes said 78702 is the nation’s second-most gentrified ZIP code.According to one breakdown, that East Austin area experienced the nation’s second-greatest urban increase in white residents from 2000 to 2010. However, changes in white residents alone are not an accurate way to measure gentrification, which is multi-factored. By other indicators, including changes in poverty, median household income and the value of single-family homes, 78702 has become more prosperous. Stacked up against other ZIP codes, though, it is not No. 2 nationally.Gentrified? Sure. Second most, nationally? Most evidence indicates otherwise.

""And no one beta-tested the site, which is almost criminal when you think about it.""The beta-testing line got picked up by conservative outlets such as the National Review and the Blaze, and we wanted to check it out.Stein directed us to a Washington Examiner report with a headline that somewhat contradicted his statement, which he acknowledged: ""Troubled Obamacare website wasn’t tested until a week before launch.""""Unfortunately, in the rush of cable news, I didn't add the clause ‘until a week before launch,’ "" Stein told us. ""I should have done that and apologize.""That’s true. But Stein is more right than even he thinks, in part because he inadvertently used the word ""beta""  to describe the specific website testing. In the IT world, there are many kinds of tests under many kinds of names.Put another way, Stein goofed -- but by goofing, he got closer to the truth.Here’s what you need to know.The Examiner story, quoting someone speaking anonymously, said officials did not allow testing on the website until just days before it went live Oct. 1. The biggest problem, according to this report and others, was that leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided to act as the central coordinator for the project (CMS would not tell the Examiner if the agency holds that role).The next day, the Washington Post described how government officials and contractors proceeded with the rollout despite a botched crucial test days earlier. They ran a simulation, unsuccessfully, in which a few hundred people tried to log onto the website at the same time. The failure proved an early warning of the bumpy road to come. Officials went forward with the launch, and the website ""locked up"" almost immediately when 2,000 users tried step one, the Post reported.Unnamed sources told the Post that an end-to-end trial run of the process did not happen by as late as Sept. 26, the week before the launch.(Here at PolitiFact we don't rely on unnamed sources, but the reports from the Examiner and the Post appear credible.)Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021""Beta testing"" is a very specific term in the tech world that most professional software goes through before launching. It comes after a product is in an ""alpha"" phase, or the earliest version of software that is subject to some tests to find any big issues. When a product reaches beta, it is tested by a larger group of people not connected to its development in an effort to gather feedback and make more fixes before a large-scale launch.Big tech companies like Google sometimes launch products in beta mode, but enterprise and government software vendors don’t usually do it that way, said Alexander Howard, former Washington correspondent for tech-centric O’Reilly Media and a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. They stop adding features in the months preceding a launch to ""start testing the heck out of it,"" Howard said.The development of healthcare.gov has been an entirely different story, he said, with no use of those terms.""The only thing we have is reporting that says the first testing occurred the last week before it went live, and then it went live,"" Howard said. ""There was testing, but it’s not clear that it was in a beta version.""According to published reports, healthcare.gov got additional features quite close to the launch, with no evidence of a consumer-centric test that went outside of the government. So Stein might have inartfully used the word beta-testing, but he might also have a point.""Even if those tests nominally did occur, they were as good as nonexistent based on the complexity of the project,"" said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist.Testing of any kind was difficult because the specifications for the website were evolving the month before the website went up, said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope and former Medicare director under former President George H. W. Bush.The Post story, by the way, said a test group of 10 insurers that had access to the site advised the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the site was not ready to launch nationwide. Insurers have been in ""regular communication"" with government officials and contractors to test the back end of the site dealing with enrollment, Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, told us.But most people are getting hung up on the earliest steps of setting up an account and verifying who they are.We reached out to CMS and CGI Federal, one of the main contractors for the website, but did not hear back.

Chris Christie seems poised for easy re-election this November, one step on a path toward a possible 2016 presidential campaign. As Christie becomes a more prominent figure in the Republican Party, he’s subject to more criticism on the national level.U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who oversees the Democratic National Committee, wrote a statement attacking Christie after a gubernatorial debate that gave us a taste of what we might hear more of over the next two years. For this fact-check, PolitiFact decided to hone in on her critique of the governor’s wage policy.""He cut equal pay for women, calling it ‘senseless bureaucracy,' "" Wasserman said.‘Senseless bureaucracy’The New Jersey state legislature passed a package of four bills in September 2012 designed to narrow the pay gap. Christie signed one, gave conditional vetoes to two and an absolute veto to the other.Here’s a breakdown of each bill in the package and Christie’s actions:A-2647: Christie signed a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination.A-2648: This bill was designed to extend protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie vetoed this bill conditionally, because he wanted it to fall under a different existing law than what was proposed by legislators. The bill became law in August, after Christie’s changes were made.A-2649: Christie gave this bill an absolute veto. It called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the NJ Department of Labor.A-2650: This bill would grant back pay to victims of pay gap discrimination. Christie gave this a conditional veto because it didn’t specify a limitation for how far back pay could go. It hasn’t been passed.Assembly Bill A-2649, the bill requiring government contractors to report compensation by gender and the only absolute veto of the bunch, is the one Wasserman Schultz referred to in her critique of Christie’s attitude toward discrimination by gender. That’s the bill Christie described as ""senseless bureaucracy.""In his veto message, he wrote that the bill ""will burden countless employers with onerous reporting requirements, thereby driving up the cost of public contracts, which are ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer ... the reporting requirements fail to advocate sound policy over senseless bureaucracy.""The bill’s focus is on transparency surrounding pay, but it would not have directly required changes in salary by gender.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Yasemin Besen-Cassino, a Montclair State University sociology professor, conducted research on New Jersey’s gender gap with the American Association of University Women. She said the bill Christie vetoed would’ve helped narrow the wage divide.""A lot of women claim they just don’t know how much men make,"" Besen-Cassino said. ""One of the things that we found in our research was that making it public and at least available to a third party would push corporations toward equal pay.""There’s a correlation between a greater level of pay equity in the federal government and also a greater level of transparency, an AAUW report said.New Mexico passed legislation a couple of years ago requiring contractors to report pay equity information. Fatima Goss Graves, National Women’s Law Center vice president for education and employment, said the law has proven to be uncontroversial there. Vermont also has a similar law.We should note that although Christie vetoed that bill and issued conditional vetoes for others, he has not abolished any existing equal pay legislation, as a reader might assume from the wording of Wasserman Schultz’s comment.""The governor has never ‘cut’ equal pay and he has a well-documented public position of supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (a national law) and equal pay for equal work,"" said Kevin Roberts, a campaign spokesman for Christie.Christie touted the importance of A-2647 and asserted his support for equal pay.""Too often, women's value and contributions in the workplace have been undermined and shortchanged merely because of their gender,"" he said after signing the bill.Equal pay in New JerseyWe wanted to take a look at the issue of equal pay in New Jersey on a broader scale and the implication that equal pay rights have not moved forward under Christie’s leadership.The median pay gap suggests that a woman in the Garden State make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. However, it’s important to remember that this number doesn’t control for factors like number of hours worked, occupation and race. The AAUW reports that one-third of the pay gap remains after these factors are controlled for.The national wage gap has not closed in the past decade, said Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center. New Jersey’s divide falls in the middle of the pack in terms of biggest wage differences, she added.""I think that for Jersey, like the rest of the country, this problem has been pernicious and persistent and it’s clear that we can’t just wish it away,"" said Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of government relations. ""We need some kind of legislative response.""Our rulingWasserman Schultz said Christie ""cut equal pay for women, calling it a ‘senseless bureaucracy.’ "" Christie didn't cut anyone's pay, though. Instead, he said it was ""senseless bureaucracy"" to require government contractors to report more employee information, including information about gender and compensation, and he vetoed a measure that would have mandated such reporting. Experts said the measure would have improved equal pay for women. But Christie also signed two other bills that may help narrow the wage gap in New Jersey.

(She) voted to increase taxes by the maximum amount under state law by voting to approve the 2012-’13 Madison (Metropolitan) School District final budget on Oct. 29, 2012. Rather than work to make government more efficient, she voted to raise taxes and increase spending. She would do the same as governor – and we’ve come too far to go backward now.""We can’t predict, of course, what Burke would do if she is elected governor in November 2014.But we can check her taxing and spending record -- scant, though it may be -- since she was elected to the Madison School Board in April 2012.Three votesBurke has taken part in three school board votes on two budgets for the Madison Metropolitan School District.In Madison, property taxes make up about 60 percent of the school district’s funding. The school board has relatively little control over the rest of its revenue, which comes from the state, the federal government and local sources such as student fees.(Statewide, as of 2011-’12, school districts got an average of 43 percent of their revenue from property taxes, although the range was 14 percent to 93 percent, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.)To back its claim against Burke, the Republican Party cited not only property tax levies but total budget figures, so we’ll examine both.1. Preliminary 2012-’13 budgetBurke joined the majority on the school board in a 6-1 vote on June 18, 2012, to approve the school district’s preliminary budget for 2012-’13. It would have raised the property tax levy by 4.95 percent.The school district’s portion of the property tax bill for the average Madison home, valued at $232,000, would have increased $91.2. Final 2012-’13 budgetFeatured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021Burke joined in a 7-0 vote on Oct. 29, 2012, that gave final approval to the 2012-’13 budget. It included a smaller levy increase than the preliminary budget -- 1.75 percent.That meant an $8 increase on the property tax bill for the average Madison home.The size of the total budget, taking into account all sources of revenue, rose by 4.3 percent.So, for her first annual budget, Burke voted twice in favor of raising property taxes and the size of the total school district budget.3. Preliminary 2013-’14 budgetOn Aug. 26, 2013, the school board voted 6-1 to to approve a preliminary budget for 2013-’14. A final vote is scheduled for Oct. 28, 2013.Burke was the lone dissenter. The property tax levy would increase nearly 4.5 percent, boosting the property tax bill by $119 on a typical Madison home.Despite her no vote, Burke indicated she was open to a property tax increase.Several weeks before the preliminary vote, she told The Capital Times regarding property taxes: ""I think in an environment where we’ve seen real wages in Dane County decrease, and a lot of people are on fixed incomes, we have to work as hard as possible to limit any increase to the inflation rate.""As for the total budget, it would actually decrease, by less than half of a percentage point; but, again, Burke voted no.So, for her second budget, Burke expressed being open to a relatively small property tax hike, but voted against a preliminary plan that would carry a larger levy increase but a smaller total budget.Our ratingThe Wisconsin Republican Party said Burke ""has proven on the Madison Board of Education"" that she supports raising taxes and spending.Burke voted for a larger total budget, which included a property tax increase, for 2012-’13.In a preliminary vote for 2013-’14, she opposed a property tax increase that was larger than she advocated; that was part of a proposal that actually reduces the size of the total budget.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give the state GOP a Half True.If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.","http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/226780021.html,http://burkeforwisconsin.com/,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/mary-burke-announces-candidacy-to-challenge-scott-walker-for-governor-b99114657z1-226724251.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCEWRq5gJXM,http://www.maryburke.com/#,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/republican-party-wisconsin/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mary-burke/,https://boeweb.madison.k12.wi.us/node/2389,http://eis.dpi.wi.gov/files/eis/pdf/schools_at_a_glance.pdf,http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/campus_connection/madison-school-board-votes-to-increase-tax-levy-by-percent/article_e7822cd2-b9ea-11e1-b784-0019bb2963f4.html,https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/budget201213,https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/node/10185,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,https://boeweb.madison.k12.wi.us/files/boe/10-29-12_min_0.pdf,https://boeweb.madison.k12.wi.us/files/boe/app%20ooo-4-36.pdf,https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/node/10340,https://boeweb.madison.k12.wi.us/files/boe/8-26-13_MIN_0.pdf,https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/files/7.15.13%20MMSD%202013-14%20Budget.pdf,https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/files/7.15.13%20MMSD%202013-14%20Budget.pdf,http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/pat_schneider/school-board-member-mary-burke-says-tax-hike-should-not/article_0fc6a288-e355-11e2-b8c9-0019bb2963f4.html,http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-state-gop-claim-on-mary-burkes-record-on-taxes-spending-b99116888z1-227116181.html?page=1&ipad=y",,"Education,State Budget,Taxes,Wisconsin,Republican Party of Wisconsin",,,,,

Cuccinelli said McAuliffe’s vow is tantamount threatening a state government shutdown -- a statement we’ll look at in the coming days.McAuliffe threw the dart back at Cuccinelli.""The only one on this stage that almost had (a shut down) effected was Ken Cuccinelli, when he almost derailed the Virginia budget when he was trying to defund Planned Parenthood,"" McAuliffe said. ""So he’s the only one on the stage that actually tried to shut down our government.""When asked for more information, McAuliffe’s campaign said Cuccinelli tried to padlock state government on Feb. 27, 2008. The General Assembly, deliberating a two-year state budget to go into effect at midyear, faced a procedural deadline that day. The House and the Senate were scheduled to advance competing versions of the budget, which would be ironed out in the coming days by negotiators from each chamber.Cuccinelli, then a state senator, threw a crimp into the proceedings by offering an amendment that would have stripped Planned Parenthood of all state funding -- roughly $250,000 at the time.  Democrats, who held a 21-19 majority in the Senate, traditionally had been supportive of Planned Parenthood, while Republicans had been critical of the women’s health group, which provides abortion services. But one of the Democrats -- Sen. Charles Colgan of Prince William County -- was firmly opposed to abortions and planned to vote for Cuccinelli’s amendment. And there was no doubt that Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, would cast a tie-breaking vote to defund Planned Parenthood.Featured Fact-checkElaine Luriastated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.On accepting corporate PAC donationsBy Warren Fiske • February 5, 2021Democrats spent much of the afternoon in caucus trying to pressure Colgan to change his vote. They failed, and Bolling pushed the amendment through. Cuccinelli’s victory was short-lived, however. The Planned Parenthood amendment was not part of the final budget approved by the General Assembly two weeks later.McAuliffe’s campaign says an Associated Press story from that day justifies the claim that Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" state government through his amendment. The article said the budget ""was almost killed Wednesday in a partisan Senate duel."" The story added, however, that the amendment was one of several issues that strained relations that day and kept the Senate in session almost eight hours before it narrowly approved its version of the budget. Even if the Senate had failed to pass its spending plan, the article noted, the state’s complicated budget process would have remained alive.McAuliffe’s campaign also backed the statement by pointing to a 2008 blog from the conservative Family Foundation that said Cuccinelli’s amendment ""shut down the Senate for over four hours while Republicans and Democrats fought within their own caucuses.""It should be noted that none of the news stories written that day characterized Cuccinelli’s amendment as an attempt to shut down state government or quoted him making such a claim.The General Assembly that year passed a $77 billion biennial budget on March 13. That was five days past its original deadline, which is not an unusual delay. Then-Gov.

Rick Scott, who is campaigning for re-election, hopes to stop.Scott wrote a letter to Florida’s U.S. senators, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson, urging Congress to delay a planned rate hike on some flood insurance policies and to continue federal subsidies.For that to happen, the Senate needs to vote on a proposal that the House approved in June. Nelson has indicated he supports a delay, while Rubio’s position has been less clear. The Tampa Bay Times reported in September that Rubio ""will continue to work with colleagues on solutions to make the flood program sustainable 'without excessively burdening Florida's families,' spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said.""Florida has already gotten the short end of the stick on flood insurance, says Scott.""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements,"" Scott wrote in a Sept. 17 letter.We wanted to research Scott’s claim about how much Floridians have paid into the program and how much we have received in claims.Flood insurance reformThe National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, started in 1968. More than 5 million property owners nationwide hold flood insurance, and about 20 percent are subsidized.After the 2005 storm season -- which included Hurricane Katrina -- the program became indebted to the U.S. Treasury. As of May 2013, it owed about $24 billion. (A recent General Accounting Office report gives a full dissection of the program’s shortcomings.)In an effort to avoid insolvency, lawmakers passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act in 2012. The law requires the program to raise rates about 25 percent a year for certain properties until they reflect true flood risk.The increases apply to businesses, second homes and homes that have had severe or repetitive losses -- that’s about 50,000 policy holders in Florida. For policy holders who own just one home, the increases won’t kick in until they sell their home, their policy lapses or they have severe or repetitive losses. The increases don’t apply to about 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes or about 1.8 million policies that aren’t subsidized in Florida.According to a FEMA map, many of Florida’s affected homeowners are in coastal Miami-Dade, Pinellas and Lee counties.For those facing the flood insurance hike, it’s a double whammy on top of increases for Citizens hurricane insurance.Florida’s premiums vs. claimsFeatured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021The state’s Office of Insurance Regulation directed us to an issue brief written by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes. (Scott’s office directed us to a 2013 Tampa Bay Times article that cited the Wharton Center’s research.)The 2010 study showed that in some states policyholders paid far more in premiums than they collected in claims between 1978 and 2008 -- a 30-year stretch. (That's five years fewer than Scott claimed, but as we’ll see, the numbers likely hold true through 2013, for a total of 35 years.)In Florida, ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements,"" according to the study.Florida wasn’t alone in paying more into the program than receiving back in claims. Thirteen states had an even higher ratio, and Colorado was the highest. (Florida was tied for 14th with Montana.)""The situation is reversed in Texas, where flood insurance policyholders paid $4.5 billion in premiums but collected a larger $6.7 billion in claims,"" the study states.The study was based on data from the flood insurance program, so we went directly to the program and FEMA to check the data ourselves. We found fairly similar numbers to the Wharton study.The author of the Wharton study, Erwann Michel-Kerjan, told PolitiFact that his figure of $4.5 billion for claims in Florida through 2008 was higher than FEMA’s of $3.7 billion through mid 2013 because he accounted for inflation. Also, it’s worth noting that many of our big storms were in 2005-06, not in more recent years. So the trend in payments from 1978 to 2008 likely continues today.We asked Michel-Kerjan if we should expect Floridians to continue paying more in premiums than they receive in reimbursements.""Keep in mind though that if there is a severe hurricane hitting the state and massive storm surge, the situation could well reverse: Florida might become a net beneficiary of the program, rather than being a net contributor,"" he said. ""This is what happened to Louisiana with Katrina in 2005.""The Tampa Bay Times explained: ""Like any other insurance, flood premiums don't reflect real-life events; they reflect risk. With its 1,200 miles of coastline, Florida is still considered more at risk than any other state. Just one major, slow moving hurricane that hits a populated part of Florida's coast could dramatically increase the state's flood claims. And private insurers have been unwilling to provide flood coverage.""Our rulingScott said ""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements.""A study from the Wharton Center concluded that Florida’s ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements."" That statistic from the study covered 1978-2008, but it’s likely the trend has continued through 2012.The only key point that Scott omits is that this imbalance is common: Lots of states pay more in premiums than they receive in claims. A major storm could change that dynamic, and the purpose of insurance is to protect against such an event.We rate this claim Mostly True.","http://miamiherald.typepad.com/files/scott-flood-insurance-letter9.18.pdf,http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655719.pdf,http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655719.pdf,https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance-reform-act-2012,https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=e0208985e8e64d44bca999325254ff5b&extent=-106.6909,33.1708,-76.9399,43.9898,https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=e0208985e8e64d44bca999325254ff5b&extent=-106.6909,33.1708,-76.9399,43.9898,http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/09/3616689/state-approves-63-percent-average.html,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/,http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/WRCib2011b-nfip-who-pays.pdf,http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/banking/premiums-rising-for-national-flood-program-though-florida-pales-in-payouts/2126888,http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/J2010JEP24.4.165_EMK.pdf",,"Environment,Housing,States,Weather,Florida,Rick Scott",,,,,

One can think of these as a series of tests to see which changes in behavior have the biggest effects in reducing the incidence of poverty.""And, according to the paper:lf all non-elderly and non-disabled family heads worked at least full-time, nationally people living in poverty would drop by more than 5 percentage points, from 13 to 7.5 percent.Or if the same proportion of children lived in female-headed families in 2001 as in 1970—""before divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing dramatically increased the proportion of children living with a single parent""— the poverty rate among families with children decreases by 3.5 percentage points, to 9.5 percent.Or if every family head has at least a high school education and earns at least as much as high school graduates normally receive, the poverty rate among families with children goes down by nearly two percentage points, to 11.1 percent.Or if families had no more than two children, enjoying the same income with fewer mouths to feed, the poverty rate among families with children shrinks by 1.7 percentage points, to 11.3 percent.Finally, the paper said, if each condition were assumed sequentially--such that heads of households kept full-time hours, were married, graduated high school and had no more than two children--the poverty rate would ultimately be 3.7 percent. ""Thus, the poverty rate among families with children could be lowered by 71 percent,"" the paper said.That’s dramatic, but it’s no ""guarantee,"" which is what Smitherman said.By telephone, Brookings spokeswoman D.J. Nordquist told us Haskins and Sawhill made a statement like the one noted by Smitherman in their 2009 book, ""Creating an Opportunity Society,"" whose theme is that completing high school, working full time and marrying before having children--each part described by the authors as a widely endorsed social norm--would ensure almost every American a middle-class income.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021All told, the authors wrote, Americans ""who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class. Only about 2 percent of this group ends up in poverty,"" they wrote. ""Conversely, about three-fourths of those who have done none of these three things are poor in any given year.""In another part of the book, the authors said that working full-time is the most powerful factor; in 2007, only 3.5 percent of families with at least one full-time worker were poor, they said.But the authors also noted that in 2007, the national unemployment rate was running at a low 4.6 percent. They wrote, then, that their analysis was ""primarily relevant to the kinds of opportunities that exist in a full-employment economy, not to the kind of economy we entered in 2008,"" a reference to the national recession.So, the virtual guarantee holds only if the economy is roaring?By email, Sawhill called this caveat important. ""The poverty rate has risen from 12.5 to 15 percent as a result of the recession,"" Sawhill said. ""Put differently, it's a lot harder to find full-time work now so it's a lot harder to stay out of poverty."" By phone, she said the virtual ""guarantee"" doesn’t apply when times are tough.Still, Sawhill said, Smitherman’s statement fit the ""spirit of what we argued,"" while having some inaccuracies. The three key factors, she said, were graduating from high school, ""working full-time for a year (not in your first job, but during the year the census data were collected), and being at least 21 and married before you had children.""  Finally, with help from the Economist, we found mention of Sawhill and Haskins in an April 15, 2010, article in the magazine on social mobility. The article quoted them as saying that family background is not unsurmountable. ""In particular, earning a degree and marrying before having children can help someone climb to a higher rung,"" the magazine said. More recently, Jon Fasman of the Economist wrote in an Aug. 24, 2013, article that Haskins and Sawhill ""have found that people who finish high school, work full time and wait to have children until they are married and 21 or older have a 72% chance of joining the middle class and just a 2% chance of being poor. The numbers are reversed for those who violate all three rules.""Our rulingSmitherman said that according to an article in the Economist, Americans are ""guaranteed"" to live above the poverty line if they graduate from high school, keep their first job for over a year and get and stay married.We did not pinpoint what Smitherman saw in the Economist. Setting that aside, Sawhill and Haskins wrote in 2009 that Americans ""who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class.""The pair did not refer to the import of keeping a first job for any time. Significantly, too, the authors stressed the economy would need to be strong for their hypothetical to fully work; that is, no roaring economy, no guarantee.We rate Smitherman’s claim as Half True.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","http://barryfortexas.com/smithermans-remarks-at-the-texas-alliance-for-life/#sthash.aaIpYf9G.dpuf,https://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2003/09/childrenfamilies-haskins,https://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/ccf/about,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/,https://www.economist.com/node/15908469,https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21584003-his-i-have-dream-speech-martin-luther-king-threw-out-challenge-america-how-has-it,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/",,"Economy,Education,Jobs,Marriage,Texas,Barry Smitherman",,,,,

We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier.""",,politifact,,"A major conundrum facing the United States in Syria is the prevalence of Islamic extremists, some with links to al-Qaida, among the rebel forces.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Syrian President Bashar Assad is probably a war criminal but some of his opponents are equally dangerous.""We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side,"" Paul said on the inaugural edition of CNN’s relaunched Crossfire. ""We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier.""These are dramatic and gruesome claims that have great staying power on the Web, so we decided to see if we could verify them. The short answer is that rebels gunned down a priest but didn’t behead him. And a rebel commander made a show of cutting organs from a dead Syrian soldier but denies actually taking a bite.The Franciscan priestA California-based news service called Catholic Online was one of the first to report the beheading of Francois Murad, a priest at a monastery in northern Syria. The killing took place on June 23, 2013, and the article appeared on June 30. There was graphic video of three men kneeling on the ground. As a crowd cheers, rebels cut their heads off.The early reports claimed the Vatican confirmed the death of the priest and took that to be confirmation that he was beheaded. The Blaze, the website of conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, carried an item of its own on June 30. The headline couched the claim as ""allegedly"" but the first line of the article was slightly less reserved with ""Syrian Catholic priest Francois Murad killed last weekend by jihadi fighters was beheaded, according to a report by Catholic Online, which is linking to video purportedly showing the brutal murder.""The Blaze article garnered nearly 41,000 re-postings on Facebook. Other websites followed with their own versions on July 1.But a more accurate account was available within hours of the original report. On June 30, an editor for the British newspaper The Telegraph, initially linked to the story of the beheading, and then issued this correction:""I need to update and correct reports that Fr. Francois Murad, a Franciscan friar, was beheaded last week. The priest was actually shot inside his church, it seems – and the video of a beheading, which went viral, does not depict him. The Vatican was widely quoted as confirming the beheading, but an investigation by the Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock has established that this attribution was false.""We found no dispute that a jihadi group, Jabhat al-Nusra, conducted the attack. Murad was shot eight times. A fellow Franciscan collected his body, and he was buried in a nearby village.By July 2, CNN also aimed to set the record straight. An article emphasized that the rebels had killed but not beheaded the priest. The next day, two other news operations followed up with their own corrections: the right-leaning CNSnews.com (""Syrian Rebels Did Not Behead Franciscan Priest--They Shot Him 8 Times"") and the New York Daily News (""Catholic priest NOT among three beheaded on video by Syrian rebels, says head friar"") . Nevertheless, as recently as this past week, a columnist for the conservative website Townhall had the headline ""Syrian rebels attack Christian village, behead priests.""A heart or other organFeatured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Paul’s second example hews more closely to the facts. On May 12, Time reported on a video that its reporters had seen earlier but was posted anonymously on the Web that day. In the video, a rebel cuts open the body of a dead Syrian soldier and removes two bloody masses. The rebel, who has taken the nom de guerre, Abu Sakkar, says to the cell phone camera, ""I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog."" His men shout ""Allahu akbar (God is great).""Sakkar then lifts one of the lumps of flesh to his mouth.Multiple news organizations carried the story and an edited version of the video. Time interviewed Sakkar via Skype on May 14. He did not deny what he had done. He explained that he felt his behavior was justified because his men had found a cell phone on the dead man with him abusing three naked women, a mother and her two daughters.""We opened his cell phone, and I found a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was humiliating them, and sticking a stick here and there,"" Sakkar told Time.Two months later, a BBC reporter spoke face-to-face with Sakkar. Sakkar at that time said, ""I didn't bite into it. I just held it for show."" However, days after the video went public, he had told the BBC that he had taken a ritual bite. The video available to us makes it impossible to tell for sure.It is also unclear what body parts he was holding. Sakkar told the BBC it was a lung; a doctor who saw the video told the BBC that’s what it looked like to him.Sakkar is the founder of the Omar al-Farouq brigade, a group of about 60 men. According to Time, the man who posted the video described him as affiliated with al-Qaida. How close he actually is to al-Qaida is unclear. The person who put the video online added the caption, ""These are the freedoms they want to import to our country.""Time reported that graphic videos of this sort have become familiar among combatants on both sides of the Syrian civil war. ""Footage of rape, torture and amputations are passed like trading cards,"" said Nadim Houry of Human Rights Watch.There is no question that such videos travel widely. Beck featured the video of Sakkar on his radio program as a clear warning against being drawn into a war in the Middle East. Beck urged viewers to share it with their friends and to contact their representatives in Congress.Paul's office sent us a statement that read, in part, ""To get caught up in the specifics of which organ was eaten or how, or the manner in which an innocent priest was murdered is to miss the truth to argue over the details: that atrocities have been committed by both sides of this civil war.""Our rulingPaul said Islamic rebels have decapitated priests, and one was seen eating the heart of a Syrian soldier.News reports show that Islamic rebels gunned down a priest but did not behead him. The murder of a priest speaks to religious warfare and that carries great weight. However, thousands of innocent people have died from gunfire in this civil war. The claim is evocative in part due to the beheading, and that aspect is plainly inaccurate. In addition, the truth has been widely available for two months and Paul had ample opportunity to know better.Paul’s claim about a rebel eating a heart is more accurate, but the details are sketchy. Both the focus on a heart and the idea of cannibalism push strong emotional buttons. But it might not have been a heart, and there might not have been an actual bite. Still, a rebel carved up a dead Syrian soldier, boasted about it as he did so, and at the very least, spoke and acted as though he were eating the dead man’s liver and heart.The first statement is flawed, and the second is largely on the mark with some weak points. Together, we rate them as Half True.Editor's note: This report had been updated to include a response we received from Paul's office shortly after our initial publication.","https://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/09/cfr.01.html,http://catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=51537,http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/06/30/catholic-priest-beheaded-in-syria-by-al-qaeda-linked-rebels-as-men-and-children-take-pictures-and-cheer/,http://catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=51537,http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100224075/syrian-rebels-behead-a-catholic-priest-before-a-cheering-crowd-wheres-the-msm-reaction/,http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/02/cnn-exclusive-syrian-monk-not-beheaded-by-rebels-friar-says/,http://cnsnews.com/news/article/syrian-rebels-did-not-behead-franciscan-priest-they-shot-him-8-times,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/catholic-priest-beheaded-syria-friar-article-1.1389014,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/09/05/syrian-rebels-attack-christian-village-n1691989?utm_source=TopBreakingNewsCarousel&utm_medium=story&utm_campaign=BreakingNewsCarousel,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,http://world.time.com/2013/05/12/atrocities-will-be-televised-they-syrian-war-takes-a-turn-for-the-worse/,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/Video-shows-Syria-rebel-eating-dead-soldiers-heart/videoshow/20047527.cms,http://world.time.com/2013/05/14/we-will-slaughter-all-of-them-an-interview-with-the-man-behind-the-syrian-atrocity-video/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23196438,https://youtu.be/PS851Fta4j8",,"National,Corrections and Updates,Foreign Policy,Military,Terrorism,Rand Paul",,,,,

There’s only one candidate under investigation: Terry McAuliffe,"" the announcer says at the start of a Cuccinelli TV commercial that’s been airing since Aug. 22.We wondered whether that is indeed the truth.The ad comes on the heels of a Quinnipiac University poll that showed McAuliffe, a Democrat, had staked out a 48-42 percent lead over Cuccinelli. The survey showed Cuccinelli is being hurt by voter doubts about his trustworthiness, the likely result of a scandal that has touched him as well as Gov. Bob McDonnell.Cuccinelli accepted $18,000 in gifts from Jonnie Williams, the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc., a nutritional supplement company. Williams was the source for more than $145,000 in gifts and loans for McDonnell and his family, most of which went unreported. Cuccinelli, in April, amended four years of personal disclosure reports he had filed with the state to include $12,000 in gifts he said he forgot to report -- including about $5,000 from Williams.Examining Cuccinelli’s ad claim requires a determination whether either major party candidate is under formal investigation. So let’s start.Is McAuliffe under investigation?Cuccinelli says his claim is based on a recent media reports about GreenTech Automotive, an   electric car company that McAuliffe founded in 2009. McAuliffe quietly resigned as GreenTech’s chairman last December -- an action that wasn’t made public until April -- but continues to be a major stockholder in the struggling company.On Aug. 2, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that GreenTech is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The full scope of the probe has not been made public, but the newspapers said it focuses, at least in part, on GreenTech’s recruitment of foreign investors.GreenTech and a partner company, Gulf Coast Funds Management, sought to raise money for the electric car venture through a federal program, called EB-5, that gives permanent resident visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in a U.S. startup company that creates jobs. The newspapers said the SEC was examining whether GreenTech and Gulf Coast illegally promised foreign investors risk-free returns.GreenTech and Gulf Coast officials have said they have received subpoenas and are cooperating with the investigation.But McAuliffe says the SEC has not contacted him and his only knowledge of the probe comes from newspaper articles. The Post reported on Aug. 22, ""there is no indication McAuliffe is personally under investigation.""Cuccinelli’s campaign, in defending the ad claim, says the investigation targets a time when McAuliffe was GreenTech’s chairman. Anna Nix, a campaign spokeswoman, referred us to an article on the investigation by Breitbart.com. It quotes Douglas Park, a California business attorney, as saying that corporate board members can be held responsible for the actions of their companies and that ""a good plaintiffs’ securities lawyer is going to go after"" McAuliffe.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order “for all federal vehicles” to be electric.By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2021Legal experts we spoke to said the facts are not clear cut.""There have been plenty of government investigations of corporations that did not involve misconduct by a high level corporate official, and plenty that have focused on misconduct by CEOs or Boards of Directors,"" said John G. Douglass, University of RIchmond law professor, in an email. The only way to know, he said, is when prosecutors announce who is involved.We should note that there’s a second investigation swirling around GreenTech, although Cuccinelli’s campaign did not cite it in defense of its ad. The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is investigating whether U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas gave preferential treatment to GreenTech and some other firms seeking to establish EB-5 programs.Mayorkas, who has been nominated for deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and is going through Senate confirmation hearings, has denied giving GreenTech special treatment.Records show McAuliffe and several of his business partners lobbied Mayorkas to speed consideration of EB-5 applications. But McAuliffe and officials from GreenTech and Gulf Coast Funds said they did not receive any favors and have not been contacted in the Mayorkas probe.So again, there is no evidence that McAuliffe is being personally investigated.Is Cuccinelli under investigation?Cuccinelli’s name has been tied to two probes this year. He initiated the first one on himself in April after amending his disclosure forms to include $12,000 in unreported gifts he received since lated 2009, when he was elected attorney general.  Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether he had violated state disclosure laws.Herring ended the investigation on July 18 with a nine-page report saying he found ""no evidence"" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose gifts."" Two days later, PolitiFact Virginia gave a Pants on Fire to McAuliffe’s claim that the probe concluded Cuccinelli ""should have been prosecuted"" but Virginia’s ethics laws are too weak.The second investigation, being conducted by Virginia’s inspector general, focuses on whether a lawyer in Cuccinelli’s attorney general’s office offered legal advice to two energy companies involved in a dispute over paying royalties for natural gas they extracted from private lands.  One of the companies, Consol Energy Inc., has contributed $111,000 to Cuccinelli’s campaign.The probe centers on emails Assistant Attorney General Sharon Pigeon sent to the lawyers for the energy companies. U.S. Magistrate Pamela Mead Sargent wrote in June that the emails ""shockingly"" show that Pigeon ""has been actively involved in assisting"" the companies.Cuccinelli has said that although Pigeon’s emails were ""overzealous,"" they ethically carried out his office’s responsibility of defending the constitutionality of a state law that’s at the center of the royalties dispute.For this Truth-O-Meter, here’s the important thing to remember: Inspector General Michael Morehart has said his investigation focuses on attorneys in Cuccinelli’s office -- not Cuccinelli himself. As noted by The Post, the inspector general is not empowered to initiate investigations of elected officials.We should finally note that there are no reports that a third gubernatorial candidate -- Robert Sarvis, a libertarian  -- is under investigation.Our rulingCuccinelli said McAuliffe is the only gubernatorial candidate under formal investigation. He cites an SEC probe into the tactics GreenTech Automotive used to attracted foreign investors. McAuliffe was chairman of the electric car company until last December and remains one of its key stockholders. But there has been no indication that McAuliffe is a target of the SEC investigation.The burden of proof falls on Cuccinelli to prove his charge against McAuliffe, and he comes up empty. The good news for Cuccinelli is that we can also say that he is not the focus of any current investigations. The bad news is that we rate his ad claim False.","http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/virginia/release-detail?ReleaseID=1939,http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-02/politics/40987370_1_terry-mcauliffe-visa-program-sec-investigation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/us/clouds-spread-to-democratic-side-of-virginia-governors-race.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&pagewanted=print,http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-16/opinions/41416432_1_company-100-jobs-minority-shareholder,http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-22/local/41435796_1_ken-cuccinelli-terry-mcauliffe-ceo-jonnie-williams,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/16/McAuliffe-Offers-Unique-View-of-His-Fiduciary-Responsibilities-at-GreenTech,http://www.dypadvisors.com/people/douglas-park/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/facebook-posts/facebook-post-misrepresents-pelosi-stock-trade-bid/,http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-25/politics/40861526_1_visa-program-immigration-services-greentech,http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/article_c9698310-c2dd-11e2-b786-001a4bcf6878.html,https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/report-from-richmond-commonwealths-attorney-michael-n-herring/530/,https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jul/20/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-investigation-concluded-cuccinelli-/,http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/ag-staffer-s-actions-in-gas-royalties-case-investigated/article_69fb024c-e265-538b-9a95-1e93acc21a79.html,http://www.vpap.org/committees/profile/money_out_recipients/3619,http://www.vpap.org/committees/profile/money_out_recipients/3619,http://www.vpap.org/committees/profile/money_out_recipients/3619,http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-13/local/41367161_1_cuccinelli-attorney-general-energy-companies",,"Ethics,Virginia,Ken Cuccinelli",,,,,

Within the history of the ornate chamber, Republican Ken Cuccinelli says, lies proof of Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s questionable ethics.""He’s the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom,"" Cuccinelli said of his opponent during an Aug. 10 appearance before Northern Virginia business leaders.Cuccinelli is referring to details of a scandal that erupted in 1997 as Congress investigated charges that President Bill Clinton and McAuliffe masterminded a program that allowed top patrons of the Democratic Party to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. McAuliffe, at the time, was finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee.We looked into the claim that the White House sleepovers were McAuliffe’s idea. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, sent an email citing a variety of old news reports and copies of documents that she said prove ""the Lincoln Bedroom scandal originated from a McAuliffe memo.""So let’s travel back in time.On Dec. 27, 1994, McAuliffe had breakfast with Clinton in the White House.  A month earlier, mid-term elections established Republican majorities in the House for the first time in 40 years and in the Senate for the first time in eight years. McAuliffe wanted to come up with a plan to reconnect demoralized Democratic supporters with Clinton in preparation for the president’s reelection two years later.About a week after the meeting, McAuliffe sent a memo to Nancy Hernreich, Clinton’s director of Oval Office operations, suggesting the president meet party supporters at meals, coffees, golf games and morning jogs. McAuliffe also listed ten of the party’s ""top supporters.""In his 2009 book, ""What a Party,"" McAuliffe wrote that he thought there was ""nothing controversial"" about the memo.""A candidate was going to spend time with his supporters. What a shocker that was,"" he wrote. ""I was careful how I worded the memo because the Clinton White House leaked like a sieve, and the only question in my mind was how many minutes it would take before a copy of this memo would be hand-delivered to The Washington Post. Little did I know that this would become the infamous Lincoln Bedroom Memo.""The one-page note became the focus a probe by congressional Republicans into fundraising at the Clinton White House.The memo did not propose that donors should stay overnight at the White House, but the prospect of sleepovers was mentioned in notes that were later scrawled on the front and back of the document.Hernreich said in a June 20, 1997, deposition to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she wrote the word ""overnights"" on the front of the memo, next to the list of ten top supporters.""I don’t honestly know if that was my idea or if it was the president’s idea and under what circumstances I wrote that,"" Hernreich said.Donald Bucklin, an attorney for the committee, asked Hernreich if the sleepovers idea could have come from any conversation she might have had with McAuliffe.""If I indeed had that conversation with Terry -- I’m not certain I did -- but if I indeed had it, then it could have, although it just as well could not have come from him,"" Hernreich said. ""Honestly, I just don’t know, really.""On the back of the memo, Clinton wrote a note to Hernreich saying ""ready to start overnights right away.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021McAuliffe told the committee in a June 6, 1997 deposition that he never got his memo back with the notes written on it.McAuliffe denied coming up with the idea for the overnights. But he acknowledged to Gus Puryear, an attorney for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, that the DNC recommended donors who should be invited to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom.Puryear: Did you ever personally propose that someone be included in an overnight stay at the White House?McAuliffe: ""Generally Gus, how this would happen is someone may call and say they’d like to do it. I would have turned it over to (DNC staffers), and they probably would have sent it to the political office. There were many recommendations, I believe, from many people.""Puryear: ""Do you remember any person that you recommended?""McAuliffe: ""I cannot, no, but I’m not saying they didn’t call my office. I take a lot of pride in what I did and how I did it. I was not a concierge service.""So who came up with idea for the sleepovers?Clinton, in a February 1997 deposition, said it was his brainchild.""Terry McAuliffe sent a memo suggesting things we ought to do to re-establish contact, which I thought was a good memo. And I told him to proceed,"" Clinton said, according to a Feb. 27, 1997, New York Times reprint of his remarks.

But the original note did not mention White House sleepovers; that idea was later added in the handwriting of others. McAuliffe has always denied he came up with the scheme; Clinton in 1997 took full responsibility for the idea.No doubt, McAuliffe strongly backed the sleepovers and recommended heavy hitters that should be offered a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

Because of the expense.""",,politifact,,"During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance.Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance.Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics,  ""85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people.""In this fact-check, we’ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we’ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year.Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage.When the Kaiser Family Foundation’s June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn’t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn’t offer health insurance.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021These two reasons aren’t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn’t face a cost obstacle is ""doesn’t need insurance,"" which was the answer of only 11 percent.In another survey, the 2011 National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, ""Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don’t have health insurance?’’ Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason.In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn’t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited ""other,"" which included ""didn’t want or need coverage,"" among other answers.""The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen.

Because defunding Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment is a nonstarter for Democrats, lawmakers are now openly pondering the possibility of a government shutdown.Other Republicans -- including Paul Ryan, the party’s former vice presidential nominee -- are warning that a government shutdown is a bad idea and won’t work anyway. That was a point he made on the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation.""Obamacare is an entitlement like Medicare and Social Security is, and so the entitlement carries on even under a government shutdown scenario,"" said Ryan, who is also the House budget chairman.First, some background.Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential.A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996.Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown. Several elements of the health care law fall into this category.Here’s a summary of some of the key provisions of the health care law and how they might be affected by shutdown.Insurance exchanges and premium subsidiesRyan referred to Obamacare being like such ""entitlements"" as Social Security and Medicare, which are not affected by shutdowns. An entitlement is a government program that is funded by a formula, rather than by the kinds of specific congressional appropriations that run out in a shutdown. Any American who meets the criteria for receiving the benefit will keep receiving payments even in the absence of congressional appropriations.The health care law creates online marketplaces where uninsured Americans can purchase health insurance, and it offers them means-tested subsidies to help pay the premiums for those plans.The subsidies fit the definition of an entitlement most directly. Because the subsidies are provided in the form of tax credits, they are not subject to appropriations, and thus should be able to proceed during a shutdown.As for the operations of the exchanges themselves, these too seem likely to be unaffected by a shutdown, although for a different reason. The independent Congressional Research Service has concluded that implementation of the insurance marketplace is being funded by long-term appropriations -- funding streams that won’t be cut off during a government shutdown.There’s one caveat, however: Delays could still occur if federal agencies have no workers, or too few, to carry out needed tasks.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021This has been an issue in the past with Social Security Administration employees. The agency’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. Would a shutdown prevent employees from going to work, potentially halting operations?A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns.According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut ""significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public,"" the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work.The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal.Noting the past experience of Social Security, CRS wrote, ""it may be reasonable to infer that any similar benefit programs"" under the health care law would have enough administrative flexibility to keep operations going during a shutdown.In other words, there’s no guarantee, but it’s likely that operations will continue.Tax provisionsIn general, tax collection is not affected by a shutdown. Anyone who incurs taxes is still liable for paying them on a quarterly or annual basis, even if the IRS is in shutdown mode. In addition, exceptions exist for processing tax payments received during a shutdown.Some Obamacare taxes, such as those on branded pharmaceuticals, need to be calculated and assessed in writing by IRS before the manufacturer pays them, so these could be affected by a shutdown, according to the Congressional Research Service. But even if there’s a delay, the taxes will ultimately be paid, shutdown or not. This is true for the mandate on individuals to purchase health insurance; people who run afoul of this pay their penalty through their tax return.RegulationsMany key aspects of the health care law are regulatory in nature -- for instance, rules about what insurers have to cover, how much insurers need to spend on health-related expenses and protections for patients with pre-existing conditions or those with young adult children. While these are all part of the health care law, a government shutdown wouldn’t really affect them. At most, enforcement efforts might lag during a shutdown, but the rules will remain on the books and will have to be respected.""At most, government enforcement activity might be put on hold, but after the shutdown people could be investigated and held liable for violations they committed during the shutdown period,"" said Ronald Levin, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.We will conclude by emphasizing the rarity of government shutdowns, and the absence of any that lasted any significant period of time.""It depends how long any shutdown goes on,"" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""It's easy to be creative for a short period but harder after a while.""Our rulingRyan said that ""Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown."" For various reasons, most key parts of the law -- the insurance marketplace, the premium subsidies, and the taxes and regulations -- should continue unimpeded. But shutdowns are rare and unpredictable, so we can’t be entirely sure that there will be no major interruptions.

For the unions, the project means jobs.Fresh off a speech that underscored the need to restore America’s middle class, Obama talked about the steps that lie ahead for the 875-mile link between the Canadian border and a distribution hub in Nebraska. The central question, he said in an interview with the New York Times, is whether this would ""significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere.""As for jobs, the president went out of his way to downplay them. In the big picture, they were but a ""blip"", as the president put it.""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true,"" Obama said. ""Any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.""There’s been a running battle over jobs and the Keystone XL. We’ve checked claims that it would employ as many as 20,000 workers. We rated that False; even the company behind the pipeline backed away from that number.To be clear, there are all sorts of complications when it comes to predicting how many jobs a complex, two-year project will generate. There are the direct construction jobs; there’s indirect employment at companies that provide the materials and services related to the work; and then there’s the really indirect effect that comes when money is pumped into an economy and people buy food and pay rent and so on.But out of all the numbers bruited about, the president’s seemed particularly low.We asked the White House for evidence to support the claim. All they offered was a statement from spokesman Josh Earnest during a press briefing.""There are a range of estimates out there about the economic impact of the pipeline,"" Earnest said. ""What the president is interested in doing is draining the politics out of this debate and evaluating this project on the merits.""Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021During the New York Times interview, the president invited reporters to use the most realistic estimates. So we went to the State Department’s lengthy environmental impact statement on the project that came out in March. In that report, the lowest estimate for jobs directly tied to construction was 3,900 jobs a year.That number came after analysts wrestled with the stop-and-start nature of construction work and converted the jobs to a yearly estimate. ""Approximately 10,000 construction workers engaged for 4-to 8-month seasonal construction periods (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 per construction period) would be required to complete the proposed project. When expressed as average annual employment, this equates to approximately 3,900 jobs.""The analysis noted that 90 percent of those jobs would come from ""a unique national labor force that is highly specialized in pipeline construction techniques."" It also confirmed that there would be few long-term jobs, something on the order of 35.The largest jobs number in the State Department report is an annual average of 42,100, but that includes part-time jobs and folds in the ripple effects as spending moves through the economy, measured over two years. The further out from the immediate project the analysis moves, the less certain the results. The report said these jobs would amount to 0.02 percent of total American employment, adding some weight to the president’s characterization of the impact on the overall jobs picture.The North American Building Trades Union said it was disappointed with Obama’s words and pressed him to let the pipeline move forward.""So that workers and their families can share in the economic recovery he is touting,"" said union president Sean McGarvey. ""The president should look to his own State Department’s findings that there will be meaningful job creation.""We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number.The only place we found anything close to the president’s figure was at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations Global Labor Institute. Assistant director Lara Skinner co-wrote a report highly critical of the pipeline. Skinner argued that the 3,900 covered employment for two years and that it should be divided in half. ""That's where the 2,000 job figure comes from,"" Skinner said.However, if that is what the State Department had meant, the White House could have easily referred to it to support the president’s claim.Our rulingObama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said.We rate the statement False.","https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/us/politics/interview-with-president-obama.html?src=recg,https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/apr/11/johnny-isakson/isakson-keystone-pipeline-employ-20000/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/29/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-josh-earnest-7292013,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/,http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/205612.pdf,http://www.sierraclub.org/dirtyfuels/tar-sands/KeystoneXL-101.pdf",,"Environment,National,Climate Change,Energy,Jobs,Barack Obama",,,,,

We at PolitiFact Georgia share a similar intrepid ethic regarding getting to the bottom of a claim. So what did we find?The Postal Service says on the facts page of its website that it does not receive tax dollars for its operations, but some context is necessary here.First, let’s look at its current situation.Before 1971, the Postal Service received annual appropriations from the federal government. Since then, it has operated independently, with revenues generated through the sales of postage stamps and services.But Congress does give the Postal Service $100 million a year to compensate the agency for revenue loss by providing, at congressional direction, free mailing privileges to blind people and overseas voters, a congressional report noted. The $100 million is less than 1 percent of the Postal Service’s annual budget.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021In 2012, the Postal Service pulled in about $65 billion in revenue, it says on its website. That’s $10 billion less than what collected in 2008, the year the Great Recession took hold. By some reports, the Postal Service is losing $25 million a day. The volume of mail the Postal Service handles has declined by nearly 27 percent since 2008, as Americans rely more on email  communications instead of letters.The Postal Service’s debt rose from nothing to $10.2 billion between federal fiscal years 2005 and 2009, according to a congressional report. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and concludes Sept. 30.Another congressional report found Postal Service operating costs may be the largest reason for its financial troubles. In 2006, Congress passed legislation requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund its future retirees’ health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year.The Postal Service has cut expenses through a hiring freeze, offering early retirement to longtime employees and closing some district offices. It’s also increased revenue in recent years through several increases in the price of a postage stamp.In 2009, the Postal Service began borrowing money from the U.S. Treasury Department to deal with its troubles. Some news accounts report the service reached its borrowing limit of $15 billion in September 2012.Sally Davidow, a spokeswoman for the union, said the Postal Service had to borrow the money to offset the health benefit changes. She argued that health benefits are not part of the Postal Service’s operating expenses.""(The Postal Service) is required to pay that money back,"" Davidow added. ""Borrowing money is different than relying on taxpayers.""Davidow argued in the union’s defense that the Postal Service has $46 billion in its retiree health benefits fund, but the federal government won’t let the agency borrow from it.The Postal Service wrote in a November 2012 press release that it had a record fiscal year deficit of nearly $16 billion. The agency attributed about 70 percent of that net loss to the health care requirement.To sum up, the American Postal Workers Union claimed in its television ad that the U.S. Postal Service doesn’t operate on taxpayer dollars and and it’s solely funded by stamps and postage. The Postal Service has borrowed money from the government in recent years, primarily it says, to cover the cost to pre-fund employee health benefits.The first part of the statement is on target.

Bush’s two White House victories, has been telling anyone who’d listen that the Republican Party must do better with nonwhites if it wants to get a Republican back in the Oval Office. Rove said that at the Georgia GOP’s convention in May, with details about how Republicans have done well among Hispanic voters in Texas by aggressively recruiting Hispanic candidates for office and conducting other outreach efforts.  He offered some statistics to outline the potential trouble for Georgia Republicans if they do not employ a similar approach here.  ""If the GOP leaves nonwhite voters to the Democrats, then its margins in safe congressional districts and red states will dwindle — not overnight, but over years and decades,"" Rowe wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. ""For example, the Hispanic population in Georgia's Gwinnett County increased by 153 percent from 2000 to 2010 while the GOP's presidential vote in the county dropped to 54 percent in 2012 from 63.7 percent in 2000. In Henry County, south of Atlanta, the Hispanic population increased by 339 percent over the same decade. The GOP's presidential vote dropped to 51.2 percent in 2012 from 66.4 percent in 2000. Republicans ignore changes like these at their peril.""  PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t seen such detailed numbers, so we wondered whether Rove was accurate and was there any context missing.  Gwinnett and Henry counties had an explosion in population growth in recent decades.  Gwinnett’s population has increased nearly fivefold since 1980, from 166,903 residents to the 2010 U.S. census estimate of 805,321. Henry, meanwhile, consistently made the Top 10 list of America’s fastest-growing counties in the early 2000s. Henry’s population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, from 119,341 to 203,923. The once-rural counties in the Atlanta area have been reliable Republican terrain in statewide and national elections, and Rove wants it to stay that way. Hispanics represent a significant portion of the population increase.  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in March 2011 that Henry County’s Hispanic population had increased by 338 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2,693 up to 11,813. Gwinnett’s Hispanic population grew from 64,136 in 2000 to 162,035 in 2010, the AJC reported. That’s an increase of nearly 153 percent.  The percentage increases we found were almost the same as what Rove wrote in his op-ed. So far, so good for Rove’s claim.  As for the recent performance of Republican presidential candidates, Rove was on target as well, according to our review of Georgia secretary of state records. In 2000, Bush, the Republican nominee for president, won approximately 64.2 percent of the vote in Gwinnett County. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney pulled 53.9 percent of Gwinnett voters.  In Henry County, Bush garnered 66.5 percent of the vote in 2000 while Romney won 51.2 percent of the vote in 2012.  Rove implies a correlation between the increase of Hispanic residents in Gwinnett and Henry and the performance of Republican presidential nominees in those counties, even though he doesn’t draw a direct connection.   Featured Fact-checkJenna Wadsworthstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.""By Paul Specht • February 1, 2021 Most exit polls show about one-third of Hispanic voters nationwide cast their ballots for Bush in 2000, which was considered a good showing for a Republican. Bush courted Hispanic voters by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail in 2000 and distancing himself from GOP immigration positions unpopular among most Hispanics.  The nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center reported Romney did not receive the same level of support in 2012, pulling in about 27 percent of Hispanic voters. Polls showed many Hispanic voters were dismayed by Romney’s position and the Republican Party platform on immigration reform, particularly their stance on tougher border patrols.  If Hispanic voters in the two counties simply liked Bush’s policies better than Romney’s, could that have accounted for the county’s overall decrease in support for the GOP in 2012? Kristin Davison, Rove’s chief of staff, referred us to past comments in which Rove said Republicans can do better with Hispanic voters with the right policies and better messaging.  Census numbers, though, cast doubt on whether Hispanics had enough clout in the two counties to sway the presidential vote outcome.  By 2010, Hispanics formed about a fifth of Gwinnett’s population, up from about 11 percent in 2000. In Henry County, Hispanics made up just under 6 percent of the population in 2010, compared with 2 percent in 2000. But the voting-age population of Hispanics in each county was smaller, and many Hispanic adults weren’t registered to vote.  William Boone, a longtime political science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the black vote is a critical element that must be considered when examining presidential election voting patterns in Georgia. Boone observed Rove’s lone reference to African-American voters was in the final paragraph of his op-ed.  ""I think what is missing from his equation is the black vote is increasing in Gwinnett, in Henry, in Rockdale (County) and throughout the state,"" said Boone, who noted that black voter turnout is greater than Hispanic voter turnout in Georgia.  Census numbers indicate that the African-American population in the two counties was large enough and active enough at the polls that they could have had a significant influence on the presidential election.  In Gwinnett, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 percent of the population in 2010, up from just over 13 percent in 2000. The number of African-American Gwinnett residents who voted tripled between the 2000 and 2012 elections, state records show. In Henry, African-Americans made up almost 37 percent of the population in 2010, up from about 15 percent in 2000. In Henry, the increase in those who voted was sixfold, records show.  In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted in those counties was 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the number of Hispanics who voted, state records show. Georgia did not track how many Hispanics voted in 2000.  Exit polls found Democrat Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president, won about 95 percent of the black vote nationwide in 2012. Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s candidate in 2000, won 92 percent of the black vote.  Davison said Rove doesn’t believe that nationwide exit poll results can be applied to specific counties. Still, Davison stressed that Rove’s overall point was that the GOP needs to do better among all racial groups.  ""So, if Republicans rely solely on white voters ... these counties will likely no longer be safe GOP counties as the nonwhite population continues to grow,"" Davison said.  Rove’s numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought.

The Legislature approved the plan that afternoon and Christie signed it two days later. Buono noted in her speech that the fiscal year 2009 budget crafted on her watch, when she chaired the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations Committee, spent less than what’s been approved for fiscal year 2014. We wondered if that was true, especially since Christie has frequently criticized spending levels when Buono helmed the budget panel, particularly for fiscal year 2008. But in this case, Buono’s claim about higher spending in Christie’s just-approved budget is accurate. Let’s review the numbers. Patrick Giordano, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that Buono’s figures were confirmed by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. We reviewed an e-mail sent by David J. Rosen, the OLS budget and finance officer, to Giordano, and then confirmed the data separately with Rosen. The result? Spending in the fiscal year 2009 appropriations act was $32.86 billion, compared with $32.97 billion for the fiscal year 2014 spending plan, Rosen wrote to Giordano. That’s a difference of $108,491,000 – or one-third of 1 percent. So, Buono’s claim is correct: spending for the fiscal year 2014 budget is higher than fiscal year 2009. For context, let’s also look at spending under the fiscal year 2008 budget – the other spending plan that Buono helped craft during her chairmanship of the Senate budget panel. Buono referenced both budgets during her speech on the Senate floor. Former Gov. Jon Corzine had final approval of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 budgets.Now let’s look at spending for every fiscal year since 2008:FISCAL YEARTOTAL APPROPRIATIONSFeatured Fact-checkRick Scottstated on February 1, 2021 in a press releaseStates are seeing increases in revenue, with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019.

Rick Perry, Jerry Patterson said in an email blast: ""Late last night, a bill supported by a majority of the Texas Legislature and a majority of Texans, was shouted down by a rude, unruly mob who decided that the legislative process is only worthwhile when it produces something they support.""Patterson, the state land commissioner, sent the June 26, 2013, blast on behalf of his 2014 campaign for lieutenant governor. Other expected candidates include the incumbent, David Dewhurst, and Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, both Republicans.In the email, Patterson followed up his reference to the legislation’s popularity by suggesting the current lieutenant governor, who typically presides over the Senate, deserves blame for the ""breakdown of decorum and procedure.""That’s an opinion; we focused the Truth-O-Meter on whether the legislation, which was backed by a majority of the Republican-dominated Legislature, had the support of a majority of Texans.As summarized in a June 24, 2013, Associated Press news article, the measure would require all abortions to take place in surgical centers, facilities designed to cope with major surgeries that could lead to life-threatening complications. As it stands, the story said, the majority of abortions are not surgical procedures, and 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics do not meet the intended standard.The bill also would require abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they work, the AP said. Finally, the proposal as amended by the Texas House would restrict abortions after 20 weeks, shaving four weeks off current law.By email, Patterson told us that a recent poll by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune showed 62 percent of Texans supporting or strongly supporting the prospect of limiting abortions that occur after the 20th week of pregnancy.According to a June 20, 2013, Tribune news article on the poll, 62 percent said they would support ""prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks."" The poll, taken from May 30, 2013, through June 13, 2013, with help from California-based YouGov, sampled 1,200 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.The Tribune reported that nearly half — 47 percent — said they would strongly support those prohibition. Its article continued: ""It’s a strongly partisan issue, however, with 85 percent of Republicans in favor of the ban and nearly half of the Democrats against it. Fewer than 10 percent of Republicans oppose the 20-week ban; fewer than two in five Democrats support it.""More broadly, the Tribune said, the poll indicated a general divide on abortion that it described as evident in past polls. ""Some 46 percent of Texas voters say it should never be permitted or permitted only in cases involving incest, rape or when the woman's life is in danger,"" the article said, while ""49 percent say it should be allowed after the need for an abortion has been clearly established, or that the choice should be completely left to the woman. Within those numbers, 16 percent said abortion should never be allowed, and 36 percent said that a woman should always be able to get an abortion as a matter of personal choice.""By telephone, UT’s Jim Henson, the poll’s co-director, said the poll did not ask respondents directly about the proposal that ultimately fell short of final approval in the Senate. Nor, Henson said, were there questions touching on the bill’s provisions for abortion clinics to meet surgical hospital standards and for each provider physician to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital.""There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban,"" Henson said.We searched for other recent polls of Texans about abortion or the legislation, finding only a survey by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Washington-based firm whose leaders include Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg.In the poll of 601 registered voters, some 52 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the firm said in a June 20, 2013, summary, with 39 percent saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The survey, taken June 17-19, 2013, had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.And the poll included a query about whether respondents would favor or oppose a proposal described as introduced by Perry and under consideration in the special session. The survey said: ""This proposal would put in place new restrictions and regulations on abortion providers that would likely result in the closure of all but five abortion clinics in the state of Texas, all of which are located along the I-35 corridor, and would ban most abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy."" In response, 42 percent somewhat or strongly favored the proposal with 51 percent somewhat or strongly opposing it, the firm said, while 7 percent did not know or did not respond.We noticed, though, that the question was preceded by inquiries arguably intended to stir respondents' concerns. For instance, the poll's first opinion question spoke to whether respondents thought women’s access to health care is ""being threatened in Texas."" The next query asked if the special session should focus on issues like education, jobs and the economy ""instead of bringing up social issues like abortion that were already addressed"" in the 2013 regular session. Farther along, the questions immediately before the one about the abortion proposal asked if the person trusted or didn’t trust Perry and the Legislature to ""make decisions"" about women’s health care; 57 percent said not.By email and telephone, Patterson told us he has seen no poll of Texans on anything but the 20-week provision.""The pro-choice folks focus solely on the ‘access’ issue,"" Patterson said, referring to criticism that the stepped-up medical standards will lead to clinics closing. But, he said, the 20-weeks’ provision became the most salient part of the legislation after it was restored to the measure in the House. ""Ask anyone you know if they're ‘comfortable’ with abortions after 20 weeks,"" he said.He later added that a majority of voters might favor the measure’s required hospital standards. ""But that’s conjecture,"" he said.Our rulingPatterson said the majority of Texans supported the abortion measure that died.Yet he did not offer nor did we find public polls covering every element of the legislation, though the GQR poll stretched to two elements of the legislation, seemingly finding a majority of Texans in opposition--though the poll struck us as laden with phrasing likely to encourage qualms about anti-abortion measures.Patterson’s statement has an element of truth in that 62 percent of respondents in the UT/Texas Tribune poll specifically supported barring abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the proposal angled to do.But the lack of other backup evidence leaves the overall claim Mostly False.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021","http://www.votepatterson.com/,http://www.mystatesman.com/news/ap/legislative/texas-lawmakers-debate-abortion-restrictions/nYSkk/,https://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/20/uttt-poll-texans-favor-ban-late-term-abortions/,http://gqrr.com/articles/2013/06/20/texas-voters-oppose-governor-perry-s-omnibus-abortion-bill/,http://gqrr.com/images/documents/061913_TX_ACLU__FQ_public.pdf,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Abortion,Polls and Public Opinion,Texas,Jerry Patterson",,,,,

In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence.Vice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, ""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That's no way to run a country.""Obama repeated Biden’s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers.The White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a fact sheet updated daily by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure.Firearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a database assembled by Slate, an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown.The numbers back up Biden’s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That’s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012.We should note that Slate’s statistics don’t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Also, Biden's comparison doesn't take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size.When Biden said ""that’s no way to run a country"", that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000.To make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That’s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown.A similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000.To get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we went to a database run by the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That’s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war.Lastly, it’s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime.Biden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting.

That distinction goes to Republican Nicholas Brady, who was appointed to a Senate seat in April 1982. Then-Gov. Tom Kean appointed Brady to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who was forced to give up his Senate seat after bribery and conspiracy convictions stemming from a federal corruption probe called ABSCAM.So Case was the last Republican senator actually elected by New Jerseyans to the Senate, but Brady was the most recent Republican to serve the Garden State in the Senate prior to Chiesa’s appointment. We make that distinction because Whitman didn’t.Brady, who would go on to serve as U.S. Treasury secretary in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, stepped down in December 1982 after Lautenberg won that year’s general election for the Senate, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term.Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before retiring. He returned to the Senate two years later and served until his death.In addition to Chiesa, who said he will not run in the special election, Democrat Robert Menendez also represents New Jersey in the Senate. He was re-elected in November.Whitman spokesperson Heather Grizzle said the former governor declined comment.Our rulingWhitman said during a radio interview, ""We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator.""Brady was the last Republican to serve in the Senate, for eight months in 1982, prior to Chiesa’s appointment.

""So why fix something that’s not broken?""PolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Eaves was indeed correct about his claim that county commissioners haven’t raised the millage rate in more than two decades.For several years, Republican state lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission over the direction of the county government. Many of the lawmakers and their constituents say they’re not getting their money’s worth in services for the taxes they pay. There’s been talk, and unsuccessful legislation at the state level, to split Fulton into two counties. Fulton has 920,583 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census.The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.281 mills, which equates to about $720 on a $250,000 home with a homestead exemption. But total property taxes in Fulton vary, depending on what part of the county the property is located. Cities add their own millage rates, increasing the overall rate. Then, there are other charges for bond payments, the county’s school system and other services. Fulton’s school board sets its own property tax rate.In 1991, county commissioners voted 4-3 to raise property taxes. Then Chairman Michael Lomax said the increase was necessary to help fund Grady Memorial Hospital. Some residents unsuccessfully tried to recall Lomax. Eaves was first elected as chairman in 2006.Featured Fact-check Facebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021Since 1991, the county government’s millage and bond rate has gradually declined. In 2011, though, it rose from 10.28 mills to 10.55 mills to help fund a library construction program. Fulton voters passed the proposed $275 million library program in 2008. Fulton public affairs manager Jessica Corbitt told us the increase of 0.27 mills was to the bond millage rate, not the general fund millage rate. It was listed on Fulton tax bills as a separate millage rate.The county chairman’s comments, though, do not reflect some property tax changes in a portion of Fulton.The county has a Special Services District for a portion of its south Fulton residents. The Georgia Legislature created the district in 2006 after the cities of Chattahoochee Hills, Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs were all created. South Fulton leaders pushed for the district to ensure funding for services in that portion of the county as those cities, most of them in the north, were being created.The millage rate for the South Fulton Special Services District was 5.73 mills in 2006, county financial records show. It declined slightly to 5.66 mills in 2007 and 2008. The rate rose sharply in 2009 to 8.16 mills, the records show. It went up in 2011 to 8.97 mills and again in 2012 to 10.47 mills.The county said in its 2012 budget book that the most recent increase was primarily due to lower assessments on property values and that the county needed the additional money to maintain the same level of service to residents there. The increases are a direct result of the defections of Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs, as well as plummeting property values brought on by the Great Recession, county officials have said.Corbitt confirmed the accuracy of the financial records. She defended Eaves’ statement in the television interview.""While it is true that the millage rate has increased for the special services district, which serves approximately 10 percent of the county’s population, the discussions related to the Fulton County legislation have primarily focused on the Countywide General Fund. With regard to the General Fund, the Chairman’s statement is completely accurate,"" Corbitt said via email.To sum up, Eaves said the county has not increased its millage rate since 1991. But the millage rate in the South Fulton Special Services Fund, which affects about 90,000 people, has increased several times in recent years.Corbitt said the south Fulton millage rate increases are not relevant to the ongoing debate. Still, Eaves would have been more precise if he had specified the difference. We rate this claim Mostly True.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/no-biden-has-not-signed-45-capital-gains-tax-or-in/",,"Georgia,Taxes,John Eaves",,,,,

Seven years of frozen wages = Disrespect.""",,politifact,,"Oregon’s largest school district and its teachers are bargaining over a new contract, with the expiration of its current contract at the end of June. Portland Public Schools is offering a four-year contract with no cost-of-living adjustments. Portland Association of Teachers would like a two-year contract with COLA increases of about 3.5 percent each year.The claim: The union had some tart words for the school district’s offer:""Did you know that if you accepted the District's proposal today, you would have NO pay increase for 4 YEARS? 7 years of frozen wages = Disrespect,"" reads the April 25, 2013 bargaining brief newsletter for members.The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon can’t weigh in on whether this amounts to disrespect by the district, but we can fact check whether the district’s proposal amounts to four years of ""no pay increase"" and seven years of frozen wages for teachers. In fact, Robb Cowie, spokesman for Portland Schools, urged us to do so.Teachers at Portland Public are on a multi-step salary schedule, with starting salary based on education. For example, the 2012-13 schedule calls for a salary of $35,886 for a teacher with a bachelor’s degree. From there, the teacher moves up a ""step"" every year to reach a top pay of $54,020 in the 13th year -- although chances are good that by then, that dollar amount will be higher. (Teachers at the upper end would start at $48,837 and in the 13th year, start making an annual salary of $73,101.)The yearly step increases aren’t anything to sneeze at. Those raises are about 3.4 percent every year.The across-the-board cost-of-living adjustments are what bump up the salaries contained in the steps from one year to the next. Otherwise the starting salary for that first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree -- or the teacher with a master’s degree -- may never change.Again, here’s an example. The last time teachers received an across-the-board raise was in the 2010-11 school year; all the ""steps"" increased 2 percent. So a teacher with a master’s degree who might have moved from $41,955 in the 2009-10 school year to $43,383 in 2010-11 would instead earn $44,251 starting July 2010.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021About 51 percent of Portland teachers are at the top step, meaning that their salaries stay the same unless the district gives cost-of-living raises or adds another step to the top. It is true that teachers who have topped out would have no pay increase for four years under the district’s offer.But 49 percent of teachers would continue to see pay go up, because they move automatically up the steps. The actual percentage of teachers who reach the top may fluctuate, of course, but not that wildly, according to historic data.PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t track down Marty Pavlik, a consultant with the Portland Association of Teachers, who in earlier interviews defended teachers as real people with escalating bills to pay. Instead, we spoke with Gwen Sullivan, union president. She said the newsletter is intended for members, who know exactly what is meant by ""no pay increase."" That means no cost-of-living adjustments, she said, and teachers should be compensated for experience as well as inflation.That may be so. But a step increase of 3.4 percent is undeniably a pay increase, for the teachers who qualify.Let’s turn to the second part of the statement, that teachers will have had seven years of frozen wages under the district’s offer. As we’ve said, the last time teachers received a COLA increase was in July 2010, right when this seven-year time period begins. We find that to be selective cherry picking of a time period by the union.The statement also ignores the fact that teachers at the top received an additional step in this school year, which amounted to a 2 percent pay raise. It’s true that teachers agreed to delay step raises by half a year in order to shore up this current budget. But still, even the district’s most veteran teachers will have seen a raise within the seven-year period, despite assertions by the union.The ruling: Hey, what’s the saying? All’s fair in love and in labor negotiations? PolitiFact Oregon says make the most impassioned pitch for your side when bargaining. But this statement by the Portland teachers union is missing some key facts. At best the union’s assertion that teachers would have had ""NO pay increase for 4 YEARS"" is Half True, as it applies to half of the teaching body. Its second assertion of seven years of frozen wages is False. Which gets us to Mostly False.We’ll explain this another way. There’s a bit of truth in the assertion -- some teachers will have no pay increase for four years if this offer is accepted. But the statement ignores step raises, a 2 percent across-the-board raise in 2010, and the addition of a top step this school year -- also known in PolitiFact lingo as critical facts that would give a different impression. We rule the statement Mostly False.","http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/04/portland_public_schools_and_po_1.html,http://myemail.constantcontact.com/District-Proposes-60-70-Take-Backs-.html?soid=1112531363895&aid=SCuvNC9SmpI,http://www.patpdx.org/salary,http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2011/11/portland_public_schools_out_of.html,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/,http://www.patpdx.org/contact,http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/portland_teacher_contract_prom.html,http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/portland_school_board_approves_4.html",,"Oregon,Education,Unions,Portland Association of Teachers",,,,,

Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis) when he appeared April 10, 2013 before an Assembly committee. ""Size alone ought not be the sole factor justifying the expense of a government unit.""Sanfelippo laid out his math:""Consider, for example, that while the county board in Milwaukee has 38 staff members and spends $6.5 million annually on itself to serve 947,000 residents, county boards in Dane, Waukesha, Racine and Kenosha counties operate with just 10 total staff members and spend a combined $2.8 million on themselves.""His final pitch: ""To most reasonable observers, there is something amiss that demands repair. (The state bill) ends the board’s uninhibited spending by capping their budget and bringing it in line with other county boards around the state.""The budget numbers on those four counties are easy to find, but we have not seen an analysis of his claim that the bill would bring Milwaukee County ""in line with other county boards around the state.""With the issue headed for a vote in May, this is a good time to check this.The claim we are looking at is about more than the numbers. It asserts the county is currently out of line and the bill would change that.When asked for backup, Sanfelippo said he was measuring the current per-capita spending of the Milwaukee board against that of boards in the next two most-populous counties (Dane and Waukesha) and two relatively urban counties nearby (Racine and Kenosha).We ran those numbers and found Milwaukee County’s board has more than double the per-capita price tag of Waukesha, more than triple that of Dane and Racine and more than four times that of Kenosha. The state bill would reduce Milwaukee County’s board budget by about 67 percent, putting its per-capita price tag between Waukesha and the other three counties cited by Sanfelippo.So Sanfelippo’s sample of four yields numbers that support his claim -- at least as far as they go.But his claim focused on counties ""around the state."" He used population as his standard, so what about other large counties?Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago Counties all have higher populations than Kenosha, the smallest on Sanfelippo’s list. If the bill became law, Outagamie’s per-capita board spending would be about 50 percent higher than Milwaukee County’s, we found. Brown and Winnebago would be very near Milwaukee County’s number.Washington County -- 10th-largest behind neighboring Milwaukee -- would be about 20 percent higher than Milwaukee, as would Marathon County. Rock County, by contrast, would still be spending at less than half Milwaukee County’s number per capita.It’s worth noting, too, that Waukesha County from Sanfelippo’s list would be spending about 30 percent more per capita than Milwaukee County on its county board. Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021The bottom lineBy 2016, when all of the budget limits would finally kick in, Milwaukee County would fall roughly in the middle, and almost exactly at the average of the next 10 highest counties.In fact, Milwaukee County’s per-capita figure would almost exactly equal the average of the next 10 counties by population. That’s if spending holds steady in those counties until 2016.By a different measure -- County Board spending as a share of total county spending -- the story is a bit different.Milwaukee County is the highest by that measure compared to the next 10 most-populous counties, but Waukesha County is a very close second. Under the bill, Milwaukee County would fall near the bottom of the pack compared to the 10 next-populous counties.That’s ""in line"" and then some.All these comparisons are rough, in part because we don’t know what the comparison counties will be spending on their boards come 2016.Even Sanfelippo concedes that finding an appropriate comparison to Milwaukee County is very difficult.And we heard another concern from Craig S. Maher, a former University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh professor who served on a panel studying Milwaukee County finances. Maher told us that while Milwaukee County’s board spending was higher, the differences among counties are ""on the margins.""Some numbers back that up.For example, Milwaukee County’s current board expenditures represent only about 0.49 percent of the county’s total spending. In Waukesha County -- which is untouched by the state bill -- the figure is very close to that, 0.43, as we noted above. Other big counties range from 0.1 to 0.31.""This isn’t a fiscal debate,"" Maher said. ""It’s a power debate.""Maher, now at Northern Illinois University, was referring to the bill’s underlying goal of restoring or increasing the power of the county executive at the expense of the county board in Milwaukee County.Our ratingSanfelippo said his bill checks the spending habits of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors by ""bringing it in line with other county boards around the state.""Milwaukee County’s board spending is significantly higher than most other large counties now, and it would fall to middle of the pack or lower under the bill depending on the measure.His comparison ultimately may shed limited light, but Sanfelippo’s claim is on target, with the cautions we noted.We rate it Mostly True.","/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/",,"County Budget,County Government,States,Wisconsin,Joe Sanfelippo",,,,,

Rob Woodall is passionate about the Fair Tax – a plan to replace the patchwork of federal income taxes with a ""flat"" 23 percent sales tax – so it’s not surprising that it was on his mind when he took to the well of the House earlier this month.Woodall introduced a Fair Tax bill in January, after which it was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, where it sits today. Woodall wanted to dislodge it.The two-term Republican from Lawrenceville calls the Fair Tax a ""plan of hope.""""It is a plan to remove the heavy hand of government from your personal pocketbook and put you in charge of your finances and your life,"" he says on his congressional website.In his 7,400-word speech, Woodall made his case for ditching our current system for a flat tax. If we did, we’d actually be playing catch-up, Woodall said.""I look at what's happened in those former Soviet Bloc countries, Mr. Speaker,"" Woodall said April 16 in a House speech. ""Do you know those former Soviet Bloc countries have all moved to flat taxes?""It is particularly galling to Woodall that the countries of the late Evil Empire have adopted this Reagan-era notion ahead of the United States. That is, of course, if it’s true.A small problem with checking Woodall’s claim is his terminology.There is the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is one set of countries, and there’s the Eastern Bloc, which included much of Eastern Europe. ""Soviet Bloc"" is a kind of hybrid of the two, but out of caution, we will assume Woodall was talking about the 15 countries left behind when the USSR dissolved.Many of those countries have adopted the flat tax, but five – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – have not.Woodall declined to elaborate on the speech when PolitiFact contacted his office. His office pointed PolitiFact to a story in The Economist listing the 10 former Soviet republics with flat taxes.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.”By Tom Kertscher • February 16, 2021Daniel Mitchell, a flat tax advocate and senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, said Woodall was mistaken when he claimed every former Soviet nation had adopted the flat tax, but he said the idea has been ""amazingly pervasive"" in that part of the globe. Mitchell suspects their experiment with communism may be a reason.The former Soviet states have been governed by people that are less susceptible to class warfare ideology. That's been a big factor, he said in an email exchange. ""After suffering for decades under communism, there's less sympathy for a redistributionist agenda.""That outlook made it easier to embrace a flat income tax, rather than a system that is graduated by income level, Mitchell said.Estonia, a country of 1.3 million, was the first of the former Soviet republics to pass a flat tax in 1994, with Lithuania and Latvia close behind. Since then, Russia and six other former Soviet countries have joined suit.Mitchell said competition for international investment has been a factor.""Among the policy elite, the flat tax was seen as leading to more domestic growth, but I think they mostly saw the flat tax as a shortcut way of attracting capital from the outside,"" he said. ""Sort of a shortcut to more prosperity.""The trend is not restricted to the former Soviet states. Some former satellite states have instituted a flat tax and some, such as Slovakia, had it and then scrapped it.A final bit of context: Those nations with a flat tax still tax income. Woodall’s Fair Tax would tax sales, which is a different conversation.So Woodall was mistaken when he said all ""Soviet Bloc"" countries have embraced the flat tax. Many former communist countries, however, have adopted flat taxes, which was his larger point.We rate the congressman’s claim Half True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/16/facebook-posts/no-biden-has-not-signed-45-capital-gains-tax-or-in/",,"Georgia,Taxes,Rob Woodall",,,,,

Failing to register will be a felony.Supporters tout the measure as a tool for law enforcement. Critics argue, among other points, that the registry will be a burden for sheriffs already charged with keeping the sex-offender registry.""The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety,"" Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, told The Plain Dealer. ""And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden.""The registry has been around for almost 20 years and has been public for more than 15. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Act, enacted by Congress in 1994, required convicted sex offenders to record their address with local law enforcement. Megan’s Law, added in 1996, allowed the information to be given directly to the public. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), passed in 2006, set registration standards that widened the reach of registration for the entire nation.PolitiFact Ohio knew the subject could be an emotional one. We asked Borror how the claim is supported that the registry does not improve public safety.She referred us first to the website of the Public Defender's Office, which links to a number of reports, and to a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal Criminal Justice and Behavior, from May 2010, which was dedicated to sex offender issues.Criminal Justice and Behavior published 10 academic studies related to sex offenses, focusingon the question of whether public policies concerning sex offenders enhance the safety of children and communities.The journal found that the subject is consistently one of the leading policy issues on legislative agendas. It concluded, however, that ""sex offender policies are often inconsistent with empirical evidence about sex offender risks, recidivism, reintegration and supervision....""Legislators cite the news media and the views of their constituents -- not research evidence -- as their primary sources of information about sex offenses and offenders,"" the journal said. One of the published studies, by criminologists with the University of Massachusetts, Lynn University and the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, focused on Ohio and Oklahoma, two of the first states to meet federal guidelines set by SORNA. Those guidelines classify offenders into one of three categories determined by solely by convicted offense. (Previously, judges determined what risk offenders posed and assigned them to one of three registration categories.)Drawing on data from more than 28,000 cases in Ohio and from other research, the study’s conclusions  ""shed doubt on the public safety utility of the SORNA classification system.""  It found that a disproportionate number of offenders were classified as high risk, placing greater burdens, perhaps unnecessarily, on law enforcement personnel and budgets.""From a public safety perspective,"" the study found, the SORNA classification guidelines hurt the ability of the system ""to effectively discriminate between those who pose a substantial risk to society and those who pose minimal risk,"" and also contradict evidence about the risk of repeat offenses for both adult sex offenders and juveniles.Another report, from the Minnesota Department of Corrections, studied sexual offenders who were jailed for failing to register with local law enforcement agencies. It found that the failure to register was not a predictor of repeated crime, other than future failure to register.An analysis of adult arrest data from 1990 to 2005 in South Carolina found that sex offender registration laws did have a deterrent effect on first-time adult offenders, but no effect on juveniles and no effect on recidivism.Borror also pointed us to a 2009 study from the state of  New York’s Office of Mental Health that specifically compares a risk-based classification system (which Ohio used to have) to the offense-based registration system, which Ohio has now.It concluded that the current system ""falls short of increasing public safety,"" citing five earlier studies that found registration and notification laws were ""ineffective methods of reducing sexual victimizations.""Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021It also noted there is evidence that such laws actually lead to more criminal behavior by aggravating the factors linked to it -- an unintended consequence of reducing or denying employment, educational, social and housing opportunities.""Although well intended, such laws have done little (if anything) to increase public safety and may in fact be lowering it,"" the study said.(A 2007 report by the non-government organization Human Rights Watch detailed the harassment of registered offenders because of online community notification.)We looked further and found a 2008 report funded by the U.S. Justice Department examining the original Megan's Law in New Jersey.""Despite widespread community support for these laws,"" it said, ""there is virtually no evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing either new first-time sex offenses (through protective measures or general deterrence) or sex re-offenses (through protective measures and specific deterrence).""Given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan’s Law on sexual offenses, the growingcosts may not be justifiable,"" it said.Another study, by J.J. Prescott of the University of Michigan Law School and Jonah Rockoff of Columbia Business School and the National Bureau of Economic Research, examined data from 15 states over more than 10 years.They found that registering sex offenders does reduce sex crime, especially among victims with a personal connection to offenders, most likely because of better police monitoring.  They also found, however, that making the registry information available to the public has the opposite effect and increases crime.""There is little evidence of a decrease in crimes against strangers,"" the study said. ""We also find evidence that community notification deters crime, but in a way unanticipated by legislators. Ourresults suggest that community notification deters first-time sex offenders, but may increase recidivism by registered offenders by increasing the relative attractiveness of criminal behavior. This finding is consistent with work by criminologists showing that notification may contribute to recidivism by imposing social and financial costs on registered sex offenders and, as a result, making non-criminal activity relatively less attractive.""We regard this latter finding as potentially important, given that the purpose ofcommunity notification is the reduction of recidivism,"" the authors concluded.The federal Government Accountability Office evaluated the effects of SORNA in a report issued earlier this year.The GAO noted that law’s purpose is to protect the public from sex offenders, but found ""analysis of the act’s effect on public safety has been limited.""Positive effects included ""improved monitoring of registered sex offenders"" and better information sharing between law enforcement agencies.Negative consequences found by the GAO included a lack of consideration of the risk of repeating sexual offenses in classifying offenders; a disproportionate increase in the workload of law enforcement agencies, and increased problems for registered sex offenders to find work or housing.What conclusion can we draw about Borror’s statement for the Ohio Public Defender’s Office,  that research shows the sex offender registry has no positive impact?We found that research has been done generally on the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification laws.  We found that studies indicate the laws have no clear effect on recidivism, or repeat offenses, which is their intended target, and are ineffective in assessing and managing risk.Although there is some indication that registration and community notification may deter first-time adult offenders, the studies find that the deterrence doesn’t extend to juveniles -- and that community notification likely increases repeat sex crimes and other crimes.With that information needed for clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.","http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/04/ohio_to_compile_private_regist.html,http://www.opd.ohio.gov/AWA_Information/Adam_Walsh.htm,http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/37/5.toc,http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/37/5.toc,http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/37/5/503.abstract,http://cjp.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/06/25/0887403409338565.abstract,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/09/11/us-sex-offender-laws-may-do-more-harm-good,https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225370.pdf,https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jrockoff/papers/prescott%20rockoff%20meglaw%20jan%2010.pdf,http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/652035.txt,http://www.wsipp.wa.gov/topic.asp?cat=10&subcat=55",,"Ohio,Crime,Ohio Public Defender's Office",,,,,

Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, took a slightly different tack during a House floor speech earlier this month: Not only would an increased tax save some lungs, but if smokers quit as a result of the increase, their wallets would thank them, too.""A pack-a-day smoker who quits because of the tax increase will save about $1,650 a year to spend on other essential household goods and services, a not insubstantial number for that family,"" Nathanson said.We started thinking about everything we’d buy with that $1,600 -- some shoes, maybe, definitely a few new records, a new computer even. Then we remembered nobody at PolitiFact Oregon smokes.Still, we couldn’t help but wonder if Nathanson’s math added up.We gave her office a call and they told us the figures came from a study done by the Multnomah County Health Department.The department found that a pack ran between $4.37 to $4.97 with brands ranging from Marlboro, Lucky Strike, American Legend and Newport. That meant a pack-a-day smoker would save between $1,600 and $1,800.Nathanson’s $1,650 figure came from the cost of L&M cigarettes at WinCo, which was $4.51 a pack.The report’s figures came from this March and April but PolitiFact Oregon likes to do a little independent research for any given claim. We set out on our own and hit up a Safeway in downtown Portland for a price survey of our own.Cigarettes at Safeway do not come cheap. A pack of Marlboros came in at $6.20 and you’d have to fork over $8 for American Spirits. That’d put you at a yearly savings of anywhere between $2,250 and $2,900. (We’d buy two computers with that bonus.)We were about to check on the price of a carton of cigarettes because our moms taught us to shop in bulk, when the kind woman behind the counter said we ought to just walk a block to the nearest Plaid Pantry.There, you could get a pack for anywhere between $4.98 and $6.25. A carton of Marlboro reds came in at $50 for 10 packs, which seemed about right.The ruling: Nathanson said that a pack-a-day smoker would save $1,650 a year. Her numbers were based on a report from the Multnomah County Health Department, but it turns out that’s a pretty conservative estimate, at least for Portland.Still, her point is that quitting will save a hefty chunk of change and we rate that claim True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

That’s the story for opposite-sex couples, but not necessarily for same-sex couples.Gay couples aren’t entitled to some of the money-saving benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. But how much lost money is it for a gay couple?Equality Florida, a group that advocates on behalf of the gay community, raised that topic as the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases related to gay marriage in March: a challenge to California’s Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (For more on the cases read PolitiFact’s primer.)The DOMA case stems from a financial issue involving Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with Thea Spyer for 44 years; they married in Canada in 2007. After Spyer’s death in 2009, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in taxes on her spouse’s estate rather than inheriting it outright, as mixed-gender married couples routinely do.Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, wrote in a press release on March 27 that she was hopeful the Supreme Court would move to end the federal ban on same-sex marriage:""If observers are correct, gay married couples including my wife and I will not be faced with tax forms that require us to lie and deny the existence of our spouse. The financial penalties imposed because we are considered legal strangers can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime. In a stroke, this financial burden will be erased.""We wanted to research how Smith concluded that gay couples can pay $300,000 more than heterosexual couples over a lifetime.Cost estimates for gay couplesIn response to our questions, Smith sent us media reports that mentioned various higher costs for gay couples ranging from taxes, to renting a car to divorce.The most in-depth analysis came from the New York Times, which spent two months in 2009 calculating the added costs of being a gay couple over a lifetime, including taxes, health insurance, pensions, having a child and other expenses.For the tax portion, the New York Times received assistance from Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The analysis created a fictitious couple in New York, gave them two kids and assumed one parent would stay home for five years to take care of them. The analysis took factors into account based on three states with large gay populations: Florida, New York and California. (The New York Times provided  25 pages of details on how they arrived at the calculations.)The newspaper calculated two separate scenarios, both starting when the couples were 35. In the first scenario, one partner earned $110,000 and the other $30,000; in the second, each earned $70,000.The conclusion: the worst-case scenario over a couple’s lifetime was $467,562. But that fell to $41,196 in the best-case scenario, for a couple with better health insurance and lower taxes. The numbers varied depending on income and other factors.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021""For wealthy couples with a lot of assets, on the other hand, the cost of being gay could easily spiral into the millions,"" the New York Times wrote.One of the reporters who wrote the story, Tara Siegel-Bernard, and two of the experts consulted for that story told PolitiFact Florida that the dollar figures in 2009 would change in 2013. But without thoroughly redoing the analysis, it was hard to assess by how much.One key factor that has changed since then is that in 2011, New York passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. The couple could now file a joint state income tax return, which may or may not save a gay couple money. There have also been some health insurance changes.Even if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA, it won’t erase all the financial and legal hurdles for gay couples, the New York Times wrote. For example, many couples would still have to travel to another state to get married.""It is hard to present any sort of average -- people are in very different situations for all the reasons you noted,"" said Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts who has studied gay marriage.We sent Equality Florida’s claim to the the National Organization for Marriage, a group that opposes gay marriage. The group’s political director Frank Schubert also noted that the New York Times analysis was built on multiple assumptions.Schubert disagreed with some assumptions. ""For example, in one of the scenarios the New York Times assumed that the same-sex couple would not receive any health coverage for one of the partners for the entire duration of their 50-year relationship. Many companies already provide health coverage for domestic partners, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Policy makers could address this issue without redefining marriage. Similarly, the analysis was conducted before New York redefined marriage, which makes the state tax calculations moot.""We asked Smith in an email why she cited the $300,000 figure.""I guess I could have said more than $400,000 but I was being conservative. Edie Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 because her marriage was not recognized, so it is number that is familiar to the general public. In addition, Florida is the least hospitable of the three states used in the modeling: Florida, New York and California.""Parenting among gay couples is more common in the South than other regions of the country, ""so we are seeing the additional costs add up,"" wrote Smith, who along with her wife is raising a son. (They married in Vermont.)Our rulingNadine Smith, the director of Equality Florida, said, ""The financial penalties imposed"" on gay couples ""can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime.""Smith said ""penalties"" are ""imposed"" on same-sex couples. Actually, it's more accurate to say that they don't have access to the same benefits as opposite-sex couples.On the question of numbers, is it possible that for some gay couples, the cost would add up to $300,000 over a lifetime? The key here is that word ""can."" It is difficult to come up with an average because the taxes, health insurance and expenses vary from couple to couple depending on where they live and other factors. The most extensive analysis we saw from the New York Times calculated a range between about $41,196 and $467,562 in 2009.The $300,000 cited by Smith falls within that range but requires some explanation.

""A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality,’ or as one report summarizes, ‘surgical patients on Medicaid are 13 percent more likely to die than those with no insurance at all.’""We were struck by the ramifications of Snyder’s claim. Under Obamacare, states are being encouraged to expand Medicaid, the government-run healthcare program for the poor and disabled. In return, Washington is offering to pay all the new costs at first, and 90 percent of the new tab in 2020 and thereafter.Expansion in Virginia, which is strongly opposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, would open Medicaid to an estimated 400,000 people. Across the nation, about 16 million would become eligible for Medicaid if every state accepted the Obamacare offer.  Almost all of these people are now uninsured -- making too little money to afford private health insurance but earning above the poverty levels that qualify for Medicaid.The U.Va. study is being cited by several conservatives -- including former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- as an argument against expansion. They say the study offers evidence that spreading Medicaid will spread bad health care results.Fact-checking Snyder’s statement requires two determinations: 1) Did the U.Va. study actually find that Medicaid recipients face a greater risk of surgery-related death than uninsured people and all other categories of patients and, if so; 2) Was the heightened risk caused by Medicaid?The U.Va. study, published in 2010, considered how surgical patients fared during their hospitalization based on whether they had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or were uninsured. The researchers looked at almost 900,000 major operations across the country and adjusted for many population and health care variables, including age, income, region, type of hospital, type of operation and other health factors.""Even after adjusting for all those things, the payer was still a predictor of poorer outcomes,"" Dr. Gorav Ailawadi, one of the authors of the paper, told us.The patients covered by Medicaid had the highest risk. They were 1.97 times more likely to die in the hospital than those with private insurance. Compared to the privately insured, Medicare recipients were 1.54 times more likely to die in the hospital and uninsured patients were 1.74 times more likely.With adjustments, Medicaid patients also had the longest hospital stays and greatest total costs.So Snyder is correct -- those covered by Medicaid did have an increased risk of mortality during their hospital stays. And he’s right that Medicaid recipients were 13 percent more likely to die in the hospital during or after surgery than uninsured patients.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021But researchers place little of the blame on Medicaid.They noted that Medicaid recipients are the poorest, sickest and least educated group of patients. They are the least likely group to seek preventive health care. As a result, they are more likely to enter hospitals in dire conditions that require emergency surgery.""Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders and psychoses,"" the study said. ""Furthermore, Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of metastatic cancer.""The researchers said that uninsured patients have similar characteristics to Medicaid recipients and that it is ""plausible"" that both groups may suffer from a ""system bias"" that limits their access to private hospitals and top physicians.""For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease,"" the study said. ""Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons.""Does the research prove, as Snyder and other conservatives suggest, that it’s safer to be uninsured than on Medicaid? Ailawadi, co-author of the study, said it does not.Not all of the uninsured patients in the study were low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid if it is expanded. Thirty-one percent of them lived in zip codes where the average household income was greater than $45,000. Many of these people may have been uninsured by choice. ""The uninsured population in our study included a subgroup that may have had a high income,"" Ailawadi said.He added, ""I don’t think we’re able to say a government-sponsored system is beneficial or not.""Our rulingSnyder is opposed to expanding Medicaid. He said,  ""A study by the University of Virginia   pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’""He’s partly right. A U.Va. study in 2010 did find that Medicaid recipients were more likely to die in the hospital during or after operations than all other surgery patients, including those who were uninsured.But he runs into trouble when he suggests that Medicaid is the cause of the high death rate. The authors of the report note that those who qualify for Medicaid are a high-risk group to begin with.We rate Snyder’s claim Half True.","http://bearingdrift.com/2013/03/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-money-a-big-government-bait-and-switch/,http://www.americansurgical.info/abstracts/2010/18.cgi,http://www.avikroy.org/2010/07/uva-study-surgical-patients-on-medicaid.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071622/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071622/table/T6/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"Health Care,Medicaid,Virginia,Pete Snyder",,,,,

Day care for poor kids is under the ax.Yet even in this budget climate, your federal government still has the money to pay for -- please disregard our blushing -- a study examining duck penises.You read that right: duck penises.This waterfowl kerfuffle erupted earlier this week, when the conservative website CNSNews.com published a story pulling back the curtain on a $384,949 grant from the National Science Foundation for a Yale University study looking at ducks’ sexual behavior and anatomy and the evolutionary consequences.""Many duck penises are corkscrew-shaped and some scientists believe this is because of a form of evolution known as ‘sexual conflict,’"" the story said.Twitter quickly took up the cause:Can’t cut spending b/c need $ to fund more studies of duck penis length"" @keithcrc, March 20.$384,949 Federal stimulus funds to study ""Duck Penis Length"". WH still closed to tours @cincinchili, March 21.""His name is Long Duck Dong."" When you're enjoying your furlough, remember that duck penis length matters. @doctrine_man, March 21. So now PolitiFact is making it our cause. We’ll fact-check the Twitter chatter stating that the federal government is funding a study about duck penises amid the austere cuts of sequestration.‘Anti-screw anatomy’Richard Prum is an evolutionary ornithologist at Yale University. We got him on the phone to ask: Duck penises -- really?His answer was fascinating, but first here’s a little background. In 2009, Prum applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant for his study titled ""Sexual Conflict, Social Behavior and the Evolution of Waterfowl Genitalia."" (It has since been renamed ""Conflict, Social Behavior and Evolution,"" according to NSF.) The money came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus.""The funding was for three years,"" Prum said. ""We managed to expand to a fourth year by basically being frugal.""Prum and lead investigator Patricia Brennan have published several papers from their research; several are in review now, and more are forthcoming.NSF awards about 11,000 grants a year, and the process is deeply competitive.""Funding rates in this area, animal behavior, are less than 10 percent,"" Prum said. ""Getting this money is like into getting into Yale as an undergrad."" The nearly $400,000 award paid Brennan’s salary, funded the experiments at the waterfowl laboratory, kept the birds healthy and fed and covered other costs such as publication expenses and equipment.Here, in Prum’s words, is what he studied and learned:""Most birds don’t have a penis. Ducks do. They still have it from the reptilian ancestor that they shared with mammals,"" he said.The duck’s penis is stored inside the body, and when it becomes erect, the process of insemination is ""explosive,"" Prum said. The duck’s penis becomes erect within a third of a second, at the same time it enters the female duck’s body. Ejaculation is immediate, and then the penis starts to regress. The length of the duck penis, as mentioned in the tweets, grows to 8 or 9 inches during the summer mating season. In winter, it shrinks to less than an inch.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021In duck ponds, Prum said, a lot of forced copulation occurs. Forced copulation is what it sounds like -- rape in nature. Even gang rape happens among ducks. And Prum found that while 40 to 50 percent of duck sex happens by forced copulation, only 2 to 4 percent of inseminations result from it (meaning times the female duck ends up with a fertilized egg).""The question is why does that happen? How does a female prevent fertilization by forced copulation?"" he said. ""The answer has to do with taking advantage of what males have evolved -- this corkscrew shaped penis.""Prum said the duck penis is a corkscrew whose direction runs counterclockwise. Female ducks, he said, have evolved a complex vagina also shaped like a corkscrew -- but a clockwise one.""This is literally an anti-screw anatomy,"" he said.When females choose their own partners -- in other words, solicit copulation -- the muscles in the vagina are dilated and expanded. So the anti-screw effect is negated.""The females are enormously, amazingly successful at preventing fertilization by forced copulation,"" he said.Now, if this steamy duck sex talk reminds you of a particular Senate candidate’s controversial rape comments in 2012, Prum is right there with you.Todd Akin, who ultimately lost his Senate contest in Missouri, angered a lot of people when he claimed, ""If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.""Said Prum: ""What we demonstrated is that what Senate candidate Akin said about rape is actually true of ducks, and why.""""This to me is really about sexual autonomy, and that is why ducks are deeply important,"" he said. ""In the face of persistent sexual violence, females have developed a mechanism to maintain control over sexual choice.""If that explanation doesn’t meet your standard for useful science, Prum had this to say in defense of pure scientific research:""I have never abandoned my commitment to the notion that the primary commitment of science is to discover new knowledge. You never know when it’s going to be practical. Advanced cultures for all of history have tried to establish new knowledge.""What’s this got to do with sequester?Prum’s grant began in 2009, funded by a law passed early that year that was meant to jumpstart the sputtering economy. The stimulus spending was meant to get out the door as quickly as possible, with much of spending set for 2009 and 2010.Sequestration -- sweeping budget cuts across all federal agencies -- came about from a budget deal in 2011. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans passed sequestration as a means of forcing each other to a broader deal on deficit reduction. The cuts were never meant to be enacted, but since the two sides have not been able to strike a deal, they went into effect March 1.Democrats and Obama have decried the effects on average Americans, such as funding cuts to Head Start programs and delayed airline flights. Republicans, who are keen on trimming federal spending, have generally sounded less dire in their sequester warnings, but they’ve cried foul when the Obama administration announces such things as an end to White House tours. We should point out that in some ways, the sequester and the stimulus are two separate issues. House Republicans tried and failed to cancel unspent stimulus money. Most of the stimulus money is already out the door. The sequester, on the other hand, is intended to reduce government spending in the future.Does Prum’s grant have anything to do with the budgetary state we’re in now?Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact: ""A lot of times scientific research is pilloried -- and sometimes deservedly so. It has to be taken in context of the need and results as well as the budgetary environment.""As far as linking stimulus spending and sequestration, you get to the heart of budgetary issues. Sequestration targets budget authority – the right an agency has to write a check, not outlays – the cash out the door. So the budget authority from the stimulus left the building a long time ago. It is well inside the outlay territory and not subject to sequestration.""""All that said,"" he added, ""the federal budget is a zero sum game and it is fair to compare spending on this here to spending or cuts over there. And the goofy is meant to make a point … but the reality can be quite tricky.""Our rulingFolks in the twitterverse said the federal government is cutting services, furloughing employees and cancelling White House tours, but it still has the money to pay for a study examining duck penises.The study is real, and it does indeed explore the unique sexual behaviors and physical characteristics of ducks. It was funded through a National Science Foundation grant that expires this year.It’s a bit dubious to tie that grant, which was awarded with stimulus dollars, with the current budget cuts, because they arise from different budgetary issues. But is the government subsidizing research on duck penises? It sure is.

The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet,"" Rubio said on March 14. ""The Chinese government will hold citizens prisoner without any right to recourse. The Chinese government coerces and tortures people until they get confessions from them.""He gave a few more examples of Chinese coercion before asking, ""We want that to be the leading country in the world?"" The crowd shouted ""No!""We wondered if Rubio was right about the Chinese government preventing its citizens from accessing the Internet.It’s not.By a wide margin, China leads the world in the sheer number of citizens accessing the Internet, with 538 million estimated users as of June 2012, according to Internet World Stats, which tracks Web use across the globe. The United States ranks second with about 245 million. About 40 percent of China’s population uses the Internet, placing it far below the penetration of many countries, including the U.S. at 78 percent. The major Internet providers in China are government-run telecom companies.Rubio would have been on more solid ground if he said the Chinese government censors the Internet.Although people in China can access the Internet through home computers, Internet cafes and smartphones, they face some censorship, said Adam Segal, a fellow who specializes in technology and development in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an email. Access to a number of American and foreign websites is blocked or filtered, such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, but there are some Chinese equivalents.""There can be very open discussion on Sina Weibo, which is a Twitter-like service,"" Segal said, ""though they are then censored if they become too sensitive.""The government blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg for reporting on the wealth of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao. And after the 18th Communist Party Congress got its start in November 2012, all Google programs, including Gmail and its search engine, could not be accessed in the country.In June 2012, Google unveiled on its Hong Kong-based search site a mechanism that identifies political and sensitive terms that may break the connection to Google, the Wall Street Journal reported. For example: the government has blocked the Chinese word for ""carrot"" which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao’s surname.The names of top leaders, dissidents and references to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square protests can also be blocked. To avoid that censorship, some people in China have referred to the date of the protests as ""May 35th.""According to the Times, all Internet traffic in China must pass through one of three computer centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, where computers known as the Great Firewall of China compare data with an updated list of keywords and Web address that are forbidden.Some Chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or VPNs that essentially allow users to ""tunnel"" out of the country to avoid the censors, but China also cracked down on those services, which its Communist-affiliated daily newspaper called illegal.Two years ago, the Beijing government clamped down on rules for microblogging, requiring users to register on sites like Sina Weibo with their real names, a move preventing anonymous commentary and criticism about the government and news events, according to the Wall Street Journal. In December 2012, the country’s congress adopted similar rules requiring Internet users to give their full names to service providers (while keeping pseudonyms on microblog posts) and Internet companies to report forbidden postings to the government, according to the Times.""China has the world's most robust controls, both technical and human, on the Internet,"" David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project website, said in an email to PolitiFact. ""But this is by no means the full picture. Internet use is growing rapidly in the country, which currently has more than 570 million Internet users, 75 percent of which access the Internet on mobile devices.""While many non-Chinese social media are blocked, homegrown versions are active allowing Chinese to even criticize authorities.""It is a messy picture, and Chinese leaders are constantly struggling to balance control, which is still a major priority, with the growing public demand for information,"" Bandurski said.Scott Edwards, an Amnesty International senior staffer based in Washington, D.C., said Rubio’s statement is up to a little bit of interpretation. Yes, the Chinese can access the Internet. But the government does not ""provide"" -- that’s the word Rubio used -- free and unfettered access. Plus, there is the undeniably wide divide in the country of access between the rich and poor.

Rick Scott.""Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, teacher raises. Who is this guy?"" Smith tweeted on Feb. 21 in response to Scott’s announcements that he would support Medicaid expansion and raises for teachers.Flash forward to March 5, when Scott gave his annual State of the State address. The former state budget slayer and foe of Obamacare gave a speech in which he called for helping the poor, the disabled and teachers.So how does a Democratic leader -- whose role is to attack the Republican Scott -- respond? By telling voters that while the Democrats believe Scott is now on the right track in some areas, the state still has far to go to help the middle class and the poor.Smith’s speech criticized Scott’s past education funding record and called for Scott to give state workers a raise, protect the environment and undo past changes to Florida elections law that contributed to long lines in November.Smith also called on Scott to work with the Legislature to ensure that it supports Medicaid expansion, despite opposition in the House. Scott announced his support for the expansion in February, but has said it isn’t one of his top priorities. Expanding Medicaid would give health care coverage to more of the poorest Floridians. Currently, the program is restricted to children, the elderly, the disabled and pregnant women.""We ask for you to provide true leadership, work with the Legislature and make sure that the House goes on with our Medicaid expansion. We are second in the nation in the uninsured. We need to make sure we expand Medicaid and use the federal dollars that will help our state budget,"" Smith said.Is Florida No. 2 in the nation for uninsured?Research ranking the number of uninsuredWe found there are a couple of different ways to account for the uninsured among the states.A spokeswoman for Smith cited an August 2012 article in the Huffington Post that ranked Florida at No. 2 in its share of uninsured residents based on 2010 U.S. Census data. Texas came in first with 26.3 percent, followed by Florida at 25.3 percent, and Nevada at 25.1 percent.The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation keeps track of state health facts and also draws on research from the U.S. Census Bureau. Kaiser examines state populations up to age 64, since people who are 65 and older can get Medicare.By that ranking, the states with the highest percentages of uninsured in 2010-11 were Texas (27 percent) followed by Nevada (25 percent). For third,  Kaiser showed a tie between New Mexico and Florida, but Florida was a pinch higher at 24.18 percent compared with 23.85 percent for New Mexico.When looking at only the sheer number of uninsured under the age of 65, Florida was third place with 3.7 million, behind California (7.1 million) and Texas (6.1 million).Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021Finally, the polling organization Gallup interviews residents nationwide about their insurance. A 2011 Gallup poll placed Florida in third for its percentage of uninsured, at 22.9 percent,  behind Texas (27.6 percent) and Mississippi (23.5 percent).Why Florida’s rate is so highSmith’s claim about Florida’s high uninsured rate raises questions about why it is so high. John Rother, President and CEO, of the National Coalition on Health Care, which supports health care reform, sent us a list of seven reasons:• The state has many small and low-wage employers who do not offer insurance.• Florida has many seasonal workers who tend to be uninsured.• Florida attracts many pre-Medicare retirees who have lost their workplace coverage but are not yet old enough for Medicare.• Many with pre-existing conditions cannot get coverage.• South Florida is an especially high-cost area in terms of medical claims.• The state has relatively weak and underfunded safety net programs for the uninsured.• Immigrants have a particularly hard time obtaining insurance due to paperwork requirements.Our rulingSen. Chris Smith said ""We are second in nation in the uninsured.""There are different ways to measure the uninsured. In terms of sheer numbers, Florida is third.We found the most useful measure is to count Floridians under the age of 65, which includes only those not eligible for Medicare. That measure shows the state in third place in the percentage of uninsured, after first place Texas and second place Nevada.Smith is slightly off on his numbers, but his point is on solid ground.

Trey Martinez Fischer spoke in advance of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in an Alabama challenge to the act’s Section 5, which requires nearly every southern state and some other governmental entities to get federal approval before changing election practices. Covered jurisdictions, including Texas, must win ""preclearance"" from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before changes take effect.Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, said at a Feb. 25, 2013, Capitol press conference that Congress made Texas subject to Section 5 starting in 1975 because the state had been printing English-only ballots, discriminating against Spanish speakers. (As we’ve noted, other triggers also figured into the decision.)Subsequently, Martinez Fischer said, Texas ""was never able to preclear; it was always a fight. Texas always ends up on the losing side."" His comments were paraphrased in an Austin American-Statesman news article as his saying that since Texas was put under the section, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it.Never?By telephone, Martinez Fischer told us that his focus has been on Texas House districts and that the caucus’ redistricting counsel, Jose Garza of San Antonio, has advised that every Texas House map as initially drawn by lawmakers had been found in violation of Section 5, which proscribes changes abridging or denying the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority group.With help from lawyers versed in redistricting, including Steve Bickerstaff of Austin and Michael Li of Dallas, we confirmed numerous instances of the Justice Department objecting to--not preclearing--Texas redistricting plans.For starters, we figured there were 16 major opportunities for Texas to redraw districts statewide from 1981 through 2011, nearly all of them touched off by an immediately preceding U.S. census. Bickerstaff noted there also was some redistricting action between 1975 and 1980; more on that below. For this fact check, though, we chose not to take into account the largely undisputed district maps for the State Board of Education; there has been little to no fight there.There has been much tussling over Texas-drawn maps of U.S. House and Texas Senate and House districts.Li, who has also been a Democratic fundraiser, guided us to Texas Legislative Council timelines outlining the litigation history of redistricting from the 1980s through 2012. Any Justice Department objections on the timelines, Li noted, would automatically tie to Section 5 since the section is the agency’s sole legal basis for judging preclearance, though he also reminded us that plans are sometimes precleared through a Washington, D.C., judicial panel.Coincidentally, the timelines also were cited as sources for a chart sent our way by Martin Golando of Martinez Fischer’s office indicating eight instances of preclearance being denied over the decades.Garza, the redistricting counsel, said by phone the key point is that ""there’s never been a decade in which the state came through clean when it comes to discrimination against minorities.""That’s confirmed by the timelines.Let’s get gritty.The timeline for the 1980s shows the Justice Department objecting to U.S. House districts as passed into law and not preclearing Texas House and Texas Senate plans drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Board, a five-person panel that can act if legislators fail to agree on those plans.In the ‘90s,the department precleared the legislated U.S. House plan--though, Bickerstaff noted, a lawsuit charging that the plan unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts culminated in a federal court imposing a plan, in 1996, redrawing 13 of the then-30 districts. Court-drawn maps are not subject to preclearance, Li advised.In November 1991, the Justice Department objected to the legislated Texas House plan; a revised plan, passed into law along the lines of a lawsuit settlement, won preclearance in July 1992.The timeline for the state’s Senate plan that decade probably should be read at your own risk. The original legislated Senate plan was withdrawn from the Justice Department before a preclearance decision, according to the timeline. Another plan, settling a lawsuit charging the legislated plan with discriminating against minority voters, was passed into law, then rejected for preclearance by Justice only to be precleared by the Washington federal court. Other judges, in Austin, ordered that plan used in the 1994 elections and, presumably, through the decade.In the 2000s, Senate districts drawn by the redistricting board won preclearance, according to the council’s timeline. Lawmakers failed to agree on redrawn congressional districts, so a federal court imposed a plan for the 2002 elections before the 2003 Legislature swapped in its version, which the Justice Department precleared in December 2003 despite a memo from staff lawyers saying the plan violated the section by diluting black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts, according to a Dec. 2, 2005, Washington Post news article. Garza noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 held that one district in the plan diluted the minority vote in violation of another section of the Voting Rights Act, fueling changes.Justice denied preclearance to Texas House districts as drawn by the redistricting board. A Nov. 16, 2001, Justice Department letter says the state failed to show the plan had neither a discriminatory effect or intent against minority voters in Bexar County, South and West Texas. A Texas-based panel of federal judges later redrew districts to address the concerns.In August 2012, In August 2012, most recently, a U.S. District Court in Washington denied preclearance of the legislated remaps of House, Senate and U.S. House districts adopted by the GOP-majority Legislature in 2011.

Conversely, three initial state plans won preclearance, though a federal court acting on a discrimination lawsuit later redrew much of one and the Supreme Court held that another one had a non-Section 5 voting-rights flaw.Bickerstaff offered his summary dating back further, emailing that by his memory, since 1975, lawmakers or the redistricting board have adopted 13 statewide redistricting plans, not counting education board plans.

Still, three initial redistricting plans won preclearance and one plan survived through its decade unscathed by the Justice Department or federal courts.

411,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-would-cut-vaccinations/,"If the sequester hits, ""hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings.""",,politifact,,"In a recent speech, President Barack Obama said that key health programs will be cut if the sequester -- an across-the-board federal spending cut -- takes effect as scheduled on March 1, 2013.""Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings,"" Obama said.We wondered if his dire claim was accurate.First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)The uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program.When we asked about looming cuts to immunization and cancer screening, administration officials pointed us to a report released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. The report sought to quantify cuts in a variety of programs overseen by the committee. We should note that the report was released by the subcommittee’s Democratic majority, chaired by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is generally an ally of the president.The report addresses possible cuts to two programs relevant to Obama’s claim. One, the Section 317 immunization program, is a grant program to states and cities, providing vaccines to underinsured children and adults. According to the subcommittee, it would serve 211,958 fewer children if the sequester takes effect.The other is the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which aids underserved women nationwide. A sequester would leave 33,816 fewer women screened for breast and cervical cancer, according to the subcommittee’s estimate.So, combined, these two programs by themselves would affect nearly 246,000 people.But it's important to note that Obama's language was imprecise enough to suggest that people may lose their access to primary care doctors outright, which would be a much broader hit than cutbacks to flu shots and cancer screenings. There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester; Medicaid, to cite just one example, is spared from cuts entirely. But Obama's phrasing could leave a different impression.Meanwhile, a few factors could make the estimate for immunization and cervical screening too high. The subcommittee’s report was issued in July 2012 using an estimated 7.8 percent cut, a bigger reduction than the 5.3 percent cut now envisioned for domestic discretionary programs.In addition, a CDC spokesman confirmed that the vaccine and cancer-screening programs are counted as individual ""programs,"" meaning that each will each need to be cut by the uniform amount. However, federal managers will have some room for juggling spending priorities within each program -- moves that could decrease the number of people affected. In addition, these two programs are grants to states, and state (or local) officials would have a say in how to spend the money.Still, the room for either federal, state or local officials to maneuver would likely be pretty limited. And there’s also reason to believe the numbers of people affected could be even higher, since this estimate doesn’t include additional programs at risk of cuts, such as the CDC’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program.Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said he has a problem with all ""doomsday scenarios"" like the one that Obama (and Harkin) are promoting, because they amount to a ""straw man"" that ""fails to point to the simple solution -- to give agencies flexibility but keep the cuts in place."" Still, Ellis said he considers the subcommittee’s calculations reasonable given the information Harkin had available.Our rulingObama said that if the sequester hits, ""hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings.""Obama's words could have left the impression that primary care services overall will be lost, rather than flu shots or cancer screenings alone.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Still, we found that one widely cited estimate found that sequester cuts to two programs alone would leave 246,000 people without the types of services Obama mentioned. There’s a lot of uncertainty about these numbers for a variety of reasons, meaning the actual number could be lower or higher. But even at the low end, it’s pretty close to ""hundreds of thousands.""

Edith H. Ajello, D-Providence, recently said legalizing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island would make it tougher for young people to get the drug, in part by cutting off the underground market that sells to minors and flourishes while marijuana is outlawed.In a Feb. 6, 2013, Providence Journal story about her bill to legalize marijuana, Ajello said that after years of making marijuana illegal, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""Ajello’s proposal calls for allowing people 21 or older to carry an ounce or less of marijuana and would require regulations for selling, growing and taxation of the drug.We wondered if it’s really true, as Ajello says, that it’s easier for young people to get marijuana than alcohol.After we contacted Ajello, we heard from Mason Tvert, an advocate for regulating the use of marijuana rather than prohibiting it. He referred us to various studies.But we had already found the annual National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse, which reports that in each of the past three years, young people reported that  it was in fact easier to get alcohol than to get marijuana -- the opposite of what Ajello said.The most recent edition of that survey, which is conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, and released in August 2012, said ""teens have readier access to alcohol than prescription drugs or marijuana within an hour and within a day.""Tvert mentioned the same study, noting that from 2002 through 2009 it found that teens thought it was easier to buy marijuana than beer. But, in 2010, the survey changed the wording of the question, asking teenagers whether it was easier to get marijuana than alcohol -- the wording Ajello used.From 2010 through 2012, the survey states, 26 to 27 percent of teenagers said they could get beer within an hour while 13 to 15 percent of teens said they could get marijuana within an hour.During the same three-year period, the range for teens who said they could get beer within a day was 46 to 50 percent, while for marijuana within a day it was 29 to 31 percent. (More teens also said they could illegally get prescription drugs within an hour or a day than marijuana).Why did the wording change?""Research suggested that teens frequently get substances including tobacco, alcohol and drugs from friends and families,"" rather than buying them, said Emily Feinstein, program director, Policy to Practice, at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.Indeed, another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, states that 7.7 percent of people ages 12 to 20 in 2011 said that they purchased the alcohol themselves the last time they drank. A little more than 30 percent of that age group said they paid for the the last alcohol they drank. (The study didn’t ask teens about the ease of purchasing marijuana.)And the Monitoring the Future study, which is conducted at the University of Michigan and has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States yearly since the 1970s, has found that alcohol access is consistently reported by students in all three grades to be the number-one substance that is ""fairly easy"" or ""very easy"" to get.Monitoring the Future’s 2012 survey found:* Nearly 58 percent of 8th graders said it was fairly easy or very easy to get alcohol compared with 37 percent saying the same of marijuana* More than 78 percent of 10th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get while just shy of 69 percent said the same of marijuana.* Almost 91 percent of 12th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get compared with nearly 82 percent saying the same for marijuana.Monitoring the Future found that students in the three grade levels said every year that alcohol was more easily available than marijuana. According to the Monitoring the Future survey figures, availability of alcohol has decreased since the 1990s -- but so has marijuana availability.Other studies suggested by Tvert did not address directly teens’ ease of access to marijuana or alcohol. Those studies did say that in the past few years there has been an increase in marijuana use among teenagers, after a period in which use had declined.Our rulingRep. Edith H. Ajello said, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""The verb choice and timing of Ajello’s comment proved crucial here. If she’d referred to how easily young people could purchase one or the other, and she’d said it in 2009, there would be more support.But all the most recent, credible, national studies we found showed that teenagers report it’s easier to get alcohol than marijuana.We rate the claim as False.(If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)Featured Fact-checkSarah Godlewskistated on February 6, 2021 in a tweet“On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin.”By Eric Litke • February 23, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection,/personalities/sarah-godlewski/,/factchecks/2021/feb/23/sarah-godlewski/child-care-costs-are-high-godlewskis-stat-lacks-nu/",,"Alcohol,Rhode Island,Children,Drugs,Marijuana,Edith Ajello",,,,,

It also would have increased the state’s 17.5-cent a gallon gas excise tax by 5 cents a gallon during each of the next two years and set the levy to automatically rise at the inflation rate of construction costs.McDonnell says that the gas tax is outdated and will produce declining revenues in the future as cars become more fuel efficient.

""Some of them, they’ve gone up quite a few times.""Saslaw, who's been in the General Assembly since 1976, acknowledged he could have worded his original statement better, saying perhaps he shouldn’t have said all the other states ""keep"" raising their gas taxes.Most states do not routinely raise their gas taxes, we learned after consulting a September 2012 report by the Federal Highway Administration and a December 2011 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.Excise gas taxes regularly increase in 14 states. That’s because they have variables in their tax rates that periodically rise with inflation or the price of gas.Of the remaining 36 states with flat rates, 25 have not increased their excise tax in 10 years of more. And 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have not raised the levy in 20 years or more.Virginia’s gas tax rate, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1987, is the second oldest in the nation. It bows only to Alaska, which implemented its 8-cent gas tax in 1970, although it was suspended for a year in 2008.Virginia’s 26-year-old tax has a peer group, however. South Carolina’s 16-cent per gallon tax went into effect in July 1987. Oklahoma’s 17 cent rate was established in May 1987. New Jersey’s 10.5-cent tax went into effect in July 1988 while Tennessee’s 20-cent levy went into effect in July 1989.Our rulingFeatured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Saslaw said the 49 other states keep raising their gas tax.Twenty-five states have not raised their gas tax in a decade or more, and 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have gone at least two decades without an increase.Saslaw offers no proof for his claim and acknowledges he may have misspoken.

The group supports measures such as requiring every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check.Regarding the prosecutions, Mayors Against Illegal Guns stated on its DemandaPlan.org website:""It is a federal crime for felons and other prohibited gun purchasers to attempt to buy a gun. The (U.S.) Department of Justice, however, has not been prosecuting people who fail background checks at licensed gun dealers, leaving them free to buy from unlicensed sellers who don’t conduct checks – including largely anonymous Internet sales.""The statement continued with a reference to one Department of Justice agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), claiming:""In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred more than 71,000 such cases to ATF, but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""Let’s look into the disparity.Gun background checksWhen asked for backup, Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, cited a 2011 report that was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and produced by the Regional Justice Information Service in St. Louis, Mo.The quasi-government agency’s report explains criminal background checks and gives statistics about attempted gun purchases in 2009 that were denied as a result of background check provisions in the federal Brady Act.The Brady Act was adopted in 1993, 12 years after President Ronald Reagan; his press secretary, James Brady; and two law enforcement officers were shot and wounded in John Hinckley Jr.’s assassination attempt on Reagan.The law requires a criminal history background check be done by the FBI or a state agency on persons who attempt to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer. If the potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the ATF.ProsecutionsIn 2009, the FBI conducted more than 6 million background checks and denied 71,010 of them (1.1 percent). The most common reasons were the applicant had a felony conviction or indictment, had a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or was under a domestic violence restraining order.So, Mayors Against Illegal Guns is correct on the first number it cited.But that doesn’t means a crime occurred in all 71,000 cases.Jennifer Karberg of the St. Louis research organization that did the report told us that if a person trying to buy a gun indicates on the application form that, for example, he is a felon, the application will simply be denied. On the other hand, if a felon lied on the form about his conviction, that’s a crime that could be prosecuted, she said.Moreover, after further review, about one-fourth of the applications that are denied by the FBI are reversed after a determination that no denial should have been done, Karberg said.So those cases also don’t involve a crime.Of the more than 71,000 cases that were referred to ATF, the agency sent only 4,700 cases to its offices around the country for further investigation, according to the report by the St. Louis research organization. The rest of the denials did not meet guidelines for further investigation, or they were overturned after being reviewed.Of the 4,700 cases that went on to ATF field offices, the vast majority were not referred to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges, the report says. The most common reasons were ""no prosecutive merit,"" federal or state guidelines weren’t met, or the applicant should not have been denied in the first place.Ultimately, the field offices asked U.S. attorney’s offices (there are two in Wisconsin) to file a total of 140 criminal charges. From there, only 77 charges were filed. The most common charges were submitting false information on the gun purchase application or being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.Karberg told us the 77 charges likely involved fewer than 77 individual cases, given that multiple charges could be filed in some cases.The author of the report, Ronald Frandsen, indicated to The Washington Post Fact Checker that the low rate of prosecution is the result of the priority given to such cases. And the Fact Checker said there is a troubling lack of detailed data that might clarify why few cases were referred for prosecution.Mayors Against Illegal Guns argues that more cases could be prosecuted.The group cited a 2004 Department of Justice review of enforcement of the Brady Act. The report found that ATF was referring ""standard denial"" cases to its field offices that ""were not likely to be prosecuted."" But it also said that historically, federal prosecutors ""have been unsuccessful in achieving convictions in many of these cases and consequently have been unwilling to expend their limited resources on prosecuting"" them.The report went on to explain why prosecutors may not want to file charges in certain cases: A person prohibited from buying a gun may have committed a felony that was not violent or was committed many years ago; a prohibited person might be trying to buy a hunting rifle; and it’s difficult to prove that the prohibited person was aware of the prohibition and intentionally lied on his application.So, there are indications that federal law enforcement authorities could file more criminal charges in cases in which a gun purchase application is denied. But it’s also clear that large numbers of the denials don’t involve any crime at all and some cases are not provable.Our ratingMayors Against Illegal Guns said that in 2009, the FBI ""referred more than 71,000"" cases of people failing background checks when trying to buy a gun to another federal agency, ""but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""The two numbers are essentially correct, but the statement takes things out of context in that, in a significant number of cases, no crime was committed and other cases are not provable.We rate the statement Half True.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021","http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data,http://city.milwaukee.gov/staysafe/MAIG,http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/186034311.html,http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/media-center/letter_121912.shtml,http://www.demandaplan.org/,https://www.atf.gov/about/,https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/234173.pdf,http://www.rejis.org/AboutREJIS.aspx,http://www.bradycenter.org/about/bio/jim,http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Archives/The-Reagan-assassination-attempt-30-years-later/4823/,https://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf,https://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/ATF/e0406/final.pdf,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/",,"Criminal Justice,Crime,Government Regulation,Guns,Wisconsin,Mayors Against Illegal Guns",,,,,

And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""",,politifact,,"Do gun laws work?As lawmakers consider President Barack Obama's call to take action against gun violence after mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado, Wisconsin and Arizona, some argue new rules won’t help.Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama’s plan — which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — is ""not going to solve the problem.""""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""We wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation’s capital cracked down on guns? Unprotected citizensIn 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up.The law’s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation’s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.We’ll note that the president isn’t proposing D.C.’s gun laws — indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table — so it’s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington’s handgun ban was followed by violence.Why would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio’s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument:The gun ban had an unintended effect: It emboldened criminals because they knew that law-abiding District residents were unarmed and powerless to defend themselves. Violent crime increased after the law was enacted, with homicides rising to 369 in 1988, from 188 in 1976 when the ban started. By 1993, annual homicides had reached 454.Shapiro’s homicide numbers match the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story — pass ban, violent crime soars — that was in reality much more complicated.We reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn’t hear back.Violent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin’ roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban’s passage, climbing steadily until the early ‘80s, diving again through the late ‘80s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early ‘90s.Then violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century.(It’s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.)But Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 — the height of violent crime in the four decades we’re examining — then later says:Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Since the gun ban was struck down, murders in the District have steadily gone down, from 186 in 2008 to 88 in 2012, the lowest number since the law was enacted in 1976.He fails to mention that drop started in 1994. Weapon-choice theoryBut back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn’t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are ""not going to solve the problem,"" citing D.C.’s experience as an example.We know that violent crime didn’t simply ""skyrocket"" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then.A similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.’s gun laws.Some experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early ‘80s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs.And the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, ""and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street.""Ah, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia?There’s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late ‘90s. (Something that the president’s recent executive actions seek to reverse.)But Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.""Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong,"" he told PolitiFact.The study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law ""coincided with an abrupt decline"" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn’t use guns.""Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented,"" the authors concluded.Despite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results.How did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don’t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop.The researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had ""a preventive effect.""In other words, even if ""violence skyrocketed,"" as Rubio said, that’s not direct evidence that D.C.’s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn’t fully ""solve the problem.""Our rulingRubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama’s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn’t solve the problem. ""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" he said. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""Crime statistics don’t support Rubio’s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws’ role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides.Rubio’s statement is partially accurate — in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place — but leaves out important details and context.

""Actually, it’s not as bad as it sounds,"" Leffingwell said, ""because it’s better quality than the water we take out of Lake Austin"" for public use. ""It’s treated to a high level.""His comparison of upstream river water to what the Austin Water Utility pours in downstream came to our attention from a skeptical Bill Bunch, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.Data analyzed by the utility, the Lower Colorado River Authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality delivered a mixed picture, also demonstrating there are myriad ways to gauge water quality.The utility treats lake water to drinking-water quality at two upstream plants and has two major downstream wastewater treatment plants, Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional. At the plants, screens and other devices help remove large objects and separate out significant amounts of sludge, the utility says, with the remaining wastewater passing through aeration basins where microorganisms convert pollutants into solids that get treated as sludge at the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant. The liquid that remains gets passed to chlorine basins for disinfection, the utility says, and more filtration. Ultimately, a small amount of sulfur dioxide is added to remove the chlorine before much of the treated water is put into the river.By email, Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart advised us that the mayor drew on the utility’s assessment that water downstream of its wastewater plants is of higher quality than water upstream, ""meaning the discharge is of better quality than the water upriver,"" she said.By email and in telephone interviews, utility officials pointed us to how the state rates the quality of sections of the river, which is broken into a chain of lakes by dams.According to a chart starting on Page 80 of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards, Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake in the city are rated as ""high"" quality segments for aquatic life, a utility assistant director, Daryl Slusher, noted, while the section below Lady Bird Lake where Austin discharges most of its wastewater is rated more highly, as ""exceptional.""""This is one of the very rare instances where the overall water quality in a river segment downstream of a major urban area is classified as better than that of the upstream segment,"" Slusher said.Not so fast, an Austin environmental engineer said.Lauren Ross, recommended to us by Bunch, pointed out by email that monitoring by the Lower Colorado River Authority indicates distinct nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the river. In August 2012, for instance, the level of nitrogen at the Lake Austin dam upstream was rated ""low,"" at 0.008 milligrams per liter, while the river below Austin was rated ""high/critical"" from Webberville to La Grange, with concentrations of 2.7 mg./liter to 6.4 mg./liter. Phosphorus levels tested ""normal"" at Lake Austin but were ""high/critical"" from Webberville to Smithville and ""high"" at La Grange, according to the authority.By telephone, Raj Bhattarai, who manages the utility’s division of environmental and regulatory services, said it’s understandable that water downstream would have higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, given the Austin region’s population and that nitrogen and phosphorus are components of human waste byproducts.Ross also suggested a look at differing levels of heavy metals upstream and downstream, which she said would indicate deterioration. The utility provided a chart showing average concentrations of 11 metals in Lake Austin and near the major treatment plants. Levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silver and zinc were the same or higher downstream. Levels of cadmium, nickel and mercury were the same, while levels of barium were lower downstream.We weren’t sure what to make of these measurements. Ross said she wasn’t prepared to say there were health effects.We asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for its analysis of differences between the water upstream and water returned to the river after wastewater treatment.By email, spokeswoman Andrea Morrow responded that agency experts consider six indicators directly comparable between water checked by the commission every few months at monitoring stations on Lady Bird Lake and Lake Austin and wastewater effluent as gauged by the Austin utility at treatment plants including the Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional facilities.According to a chart prepared by commission staff, both the water upstream and the effluent have similar, reasonable acidity/alkalinity and dissolved levels of oxygen. The utility’s effluent is of greater clarity, the chart suggests, and has lower E. coli levels, which can indicate fecal contamination and the potential for waterborne disease.However, the effluent has higher levels of phosphorus (as measured at two smaller plants, Morrow said) and ammonia-nitrogen, the latter of which can be toxic to aquatic life in overly high concentrations, though it typically nourishes plants and algae, Morrow said.Among six plants where effluent has been checked for ammonia-nitrogen, average levels ranged from 0.2 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter compared with permitted levels of 2 or 3 milligrams per liter, varying by location. Raw lake water, upstream, averaged 0.04 milligrams per liter for ammonia-nitrogen, the chart says.Morrow wrote: ""These are only a fraction of water quality parameters that could potentially be compared between the two water types, but the reality is that available data allows only a handful to be evaluated."" By the indicators, she summarized, ""the effluent tends to be clearer and lower in bacteria levels, while the lake water"" before it is taken in by the utility ""is generally lower in nutrient concentrations. Dissolved oxygen and pH were comparable between the two types. So with respect to the statement that the effluent quality is higher than the source water, for some things it’s true, for others it’s not.""Ross, speaking to the commission’s chart, said the utility does not check nitrogen levels of its effluent and ""failing to monitor for wastewater effluent’s most significant contributions to stream degradation hides the true impact of Austin’s wastewater effluent on downstream water quality.""Bhattarai said the utility measures what’s required to be measured under its state-granted permit.By email, Slusher said the utility doesn’t disagree with the commission analysis of individual elements in the wastewater effluent, though the big picture remains, he said, that the river downstream has judged of higher quality for aquatic life than Lake Austin.In contrast, Ross said the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus downstream signal the effluent is not of higher quality, though she also said she’s not saying that the utility is not doing a good job.We gathered more detail.In the last three months of 2012, the utility said by email, the effluent from the major treatment plants had about nine times the level of ammonia that Lake Austin had in late 2010, the last time the utility checked in that stretch, and more than 850 times the amount of nitrogen that Lake Austin had in 2010.Generally, Bhattarai said, the effluent can be of better quality than Lake Austin upstream, by certain parameters at certain times, but the utility doesn’t say that is always the case.Our rulingLeffingwell said Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the river, is of higher quality than water the city removes upstream for public use.Some indicators suggest the river below Austin is of higher quality for aquatic life than the water in Lake Austin, but other measurements suggest higher downstream levels of nitrogen and phosphorus.Besides, the mayor specified that the wastewater effluent is of higher quality than water in Lake Austin. The state’s analysis was that some elements of the effluent are better, some worse, with which the utility seemed to concur.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021This claim ultimately strikes us as oversimplifying a judgment that depends on which of many possible quality indicators is considered most significant.

That rule became law in summer 2011.Jonathan Maus, who runs the blog BikePortland.org, announced recently on Twitter that the new law applied to cyclists as well. After some research he concluded that, ""If on your bike on sidewalk, all u have to do is dip wheel into road and cars must legally stop.""Maus was specifically referring to crosswalks -- not just anywhere in the road. That becomes clear as you review his tweets and a blog post he wrote on the subject.""I was super confused,"" he said about the law when we called to ask about the tweets. ""It's hard to tease out exactly ... especially on a bike. It's like a mutant vehicle.""We wondered if that was an accurate reading of the relatively new law, so we called Sheila Lyons, the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Program manager.She pointed us toward ORS 811.028, the section affected by the new law. Specifically: ""For the purposes of this section, a pedestrian is crossing the roadway in a crosswalk when any part or extension of the pedestrian, including but not limited to any part of the pedestrians [sic] body, wheelchair, cane, crutch or bicycle, moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with the intent to proceed.""Based on that, Maus seemed to be right, but we weren’t completely sold. We wondered whether it was legal for a bicyclist to ride a bike through a crosswalk. It seemed to us that they’d probably have to walk it.We asked Lyons about that, too. The answer was, it turned out, that cyclists can bike on sidewalks and in crosswalks. But there are caveats. Some urban cores prohibit cyclists from riding on sidewalks, so it’s important to note local rules. Perhaps more importantly, ORS 814.410says mounted cyclists are operating a bicycle unsafely on a sidewalk if  they are moving ""at a speed greater than an ordinary walk when approaching or entering a crosswalk.""Basically, cyclists can ride in a crosswalk so long as they’re not moving faster than an ordinary walker. And yes, dipping a wheel into the crosswalk is enough for a person riding a bike to signal intent to cross.We called Ray Thomas, a Portland personal injury attorney who specializes in bike laws, to make sure we had this right. He said our reading of the laws was exactly as he understood them. He called the recent change ""the Oregon pedestrian revolution"" in that, legally speaking, pedestrians no longer need to enter the roadway completely to get a car to stop.  Finally, we also talked to Oregon Sens. Jackie Dingfelder and Ginny Burdick, both of whom helped pass the crosswalk law.

Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, on his Dec. 16, 2012, show, two days after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre.Gohmert answered in part, ""For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government.""We contacted spokeswomen for Gohmert, seeking details on the Washington quotation, but didn’t hear back.But a Web search led us to a similar statement that Washington made in the first State of the Union address, Jan. 8, 1790: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""Experts told us, though, that Washington was calling for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not anticipating a citizens’ stand against their own government’s tyranny.The statement comes near the beginning of Washington’s speech: Among the interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite.

Kim • February 18, 2021The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable, will be entitled to mature deliberation.Ron Chernow, whose ""Washington: A Life"" won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, helped us translate that into 21st-century-ese.""In this passage, Washington is talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies,"" Chernow told us by email.John Woolley, co-creator of the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara (where we first saw the speech), also said Washington was speaking about external threats and ""not being dependent on imported weapons.""""He said that as a practical matter, the young and vulnerable USA needed to be prepared to mount an effective defense against other"" nations, Woolley told us by email. The Senate and House both issued formal responses, Woolley said, and ""there is no hint in either of these that the members of Congress thought there was something in that speech about gun rights.""Washington’s address goes on to say that peaceful measures having failed in regards to ""certain tribes of hostile Indians"" on the southern and western frontiers, ""we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union.""The ""common defence,"" being prepared for war and having the ability to protect against hostile tribes all refer to outside threats.Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia, told us by email, ""Washington never said, to my knowledge, anything about arms providing a safeguard against any so-called ‘tyranny’ of government.’ ""In reading the ""armed, but disciplined"" quotation, Lengel said, ""emphasis should be on the word ‘disciplined,’ by which Washington was taking a backhanded swipe at the militia, which he considered undisciplined and next to useless in combat. Washington was all for an ordered, professional standing army under the command of a strong central government.""But an army was expensive, as Washington wrote in a May 2, 1783, memo to a congressional committee that asked for his advice on how to organize the military in peacetime.""We are too poor to maintain a standing Army adequate to our defence,"" he said, and suggested a small regular army supplemented by a well-organized militia -- a part-time force of volunteers, called up in emergencies. The Militia Acts of 1792 tracked with the memo’s description, calling for white men 18 to 45 years old to be enrolled in a militia. A cost-cutting provision required them to provide their own arms and ammunition.So there’s evidence that post-Revolutionary lawmakers expected citizens to own firearms. And, Woolley said, some leaders then undoubtedly ""endorsed views like those Mr. Gohmert expresses -- perhaps more precisely, in order to stay free, the people should have the right to be armed.""Washington, though, does not appear to have been among them.Lengel said, ""The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington.""Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians.""Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, told us via email, ""Washington’s actual quote is in regard to the people serving in the militia as an arm of the government,"" rather than as an armed resistance to government.In fact, she said, Washington called up militias to put down just such a rebellion a few years later.During the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, she said, ""citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced."" Washington was ""concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,"" and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- ""citizen-soldiers,"" she said, ""acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens.""Our rulingGohmert’s rendering, ""George Washington said a free people should be an armed people,"" seemingly tracks Washington’s words to the nation: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""Contrary to Gohmert’s characterization, though, Washington was not speaking about citizens arming themselves in case of government tyranny. Quite the opposite: The president and former general was calling for disciplined troops to fight on behalf of the government.Gohmert’s statement is False.","http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2012/12/16/connecticut-school-shooting-reignites-gun-control-debate#p//v/2039381272001,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/nyregion/newtown-mourns-last-of-its-children-killed-in-massacre.html?_r=0,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29431,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/18/facebook-posts/yes-aversion-federal-regulation-drove-texas-isolat/,http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2011-Biography-or-Autobiography,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/,http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/union/reply1.html#senate,http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/union/reply1.html#house,http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/,http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_12s6.html,http://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/war_1783apr9.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/06/26/george-washingtons-individual-mandates/,http://www.mountvernon.org/educational-resources,http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/peopleevents/pande22.html,http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3458",,"Government Regulation,Texas,Guns,Louie Gohmert",,,,,

Jim Moran, D-8th, is concerned that federal employees will be viewed as sacrificial lambs in negotiations to cut deficits and avoid the end-of-the-year fiscal cliff.So he wrote a letter reminding President Barack Obama of a number of steps Congress and the White House already have taken to save money at the expense of U.S. government workers. The Nov. 21 missive was signed by a bipartisan group of nine House members from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia who represent large numbers of federal employees.Moran wrote, ""Since the beginning of 2011, through various legislative and administration actions, the budget savings derived from reduced compensation and benefits for the federal workforce has totaled at least $103 billion (or more than $50,000 per employee), as measured over the 10 year budget window.""We wondered his figures on compensation and benefits cuts for federal employees -- at least $103 billion over 10 years, more than $50,000 per worker -- hold up.Anne Hughes, Moran’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a variety of White House and congressional documents that she said back up her boss.Moran’s estimate of $103 billion in compensation and benefits cuts is based on three actions:*Congress canceled 1.4 percent cost-of living raises scheduled for all federal civilian employees in 2011 and 2012. The White House, which proposed the pay freeze, estimated it would save $60 billion over 10 years.*Obama has asked for a 0.5 percent pay raise for federal employees in 2013, but Congress is not expected to put the increase into effect before April, when it needs to approve a new continuing resolution to fund government. Congress, on the other hand, has approved a 1.7 percent raise for the military that would go into effect Jan. 1. Prior to the recession, Congress typically approved equal raises for federal workers and the military. The White House estimates the smaller pay hike for bureaucrats would save $28 billion over 10 years.*Pension contributions made by new federal employees will be increased as a result of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Starting Jan. 1, new workers will have to contribute 2.3 percent of their pay to retirement while other federal bureaucrats will continue to pay 0.8 percent. The Senate Finance Committee and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate that the increase for new employees will save the government $15.5 billion over 11 years -- not the 10 years mentioned in Moran’s letter.These three actions add up to $103.5 billion -- almost exactly the number Moran cited.But do they break down to ""more than $50,000"" per federal worker, as the congressman claimed?Not quite.The number of full time, federal civilian employees has held steady at 2.1 million since 2010, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management that Moran used and to White House figures. So the lost wages and benefits comes to about $49,047 per worker.We should note that the White House estimates the U.S. spent $242 billion in salaries and benefits for executive branch employees, not including the military, during fiscal 2012, which ended Sept. 30. That amounts to 6.4 percent of the $3.8 trillion in federal spending during the budget year.Our rulingMoran wrote that Congress and the White House has saved $103 billion over 10 years by cutting pay raises and benefits for non-military federal employees. That breaks down to more than $50,000 per worker, he wrote.Moran is right about the $103 billion total cost. The discrepancies in other numbers he uses are insignificant.

Those costs include vehicle damage and repair, medical care and even funeral expenses, according to the report.But the report also points out how there has been an overall reduction in crashes and costs at the two locations -- both in Newark -- where cameras had been operational for two full years.Comparing the second year of operation to the year before installation, the combined effect at those two locations has been a reduction in total crashes from 47 to 20, or about 57 percent, according to the report. At those locations, total estimated crash severity costs have decreased by $268,900, the report states.When comparing the first and second years of camera use at those intersections, total crashes dropped from 26 to 20, or about 23 percent, and there was a net reduction in crash severity costs of $119,900, the report states.Doherty pointed out how the total number of right-angle and rear-end crashes at those two intersections only dropped from 9 to 8 between the first and second years of camera operation. The senator referred to that reduction as ""a statistically insignificant decline.""""There is no evidence that the massive safety gains that we were told to expect have appeared or are likely to appear if the red light pilot program is allowed to continue,"" Doherty added.But the state report repeatedly cautions readers to not draw final conclusions, and notes how many other locations had not been involved in the program long enough to be included in the crash analyses.Of the analysis regarding those 24 locations, the report says, ""it is important to remember that safety trends are never established over a single year, and as such additional sustained analysis is needed before concrete conclusions can be drawn.""Our rulingIn an op-ed, Doherty claimed a new state report ""confirms"" that red-light cameras ""lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost.""The senator’s claim accurately reflects the overall findings at the 24 locations where cameras had been operational for at least a full year by the end of 2011.

Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., was skeptical of the deal. While noting that the Memphis Airport Authority and the Memphis Chamber of Commerce backed it, Cohen sought some assurances from those seeking to implement it.The Memphis congressmen is now assailing Delta, which has grown very unpopular in the region while flights are cut and fares are raised, for failing to live up to those assurances.Cohen put out a press release Oct. 31 saying some of the assurances he received were misrepresentations and ""that Delta has once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis."" The release’s opening paragraph referred to a ""string of broken promises,"" so we decided to look at the history and determine if Cohen is accurately representing the company’s record.Cohen’s office provided hearing transcripts and press accounts. In one, the CEO of Delta, Richard H. Anderson, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee’s task force on antitrust laws in April 2008, and Cohen was there to question him. Anderson, who had served as a senior vice president for labor relations at Northwest in the early 1990s, noted that he’d spent ""many days in Memphis"" and was ""instrumental in launching the service from Memphis to Amsterdam some, I guess, 10 years ago now.""Cohen: ""The Amsterdam flight would remain, I presume?""Anderson: ""Yes.""The Delta-Northwest merger was announced on April 14, 2008, and the boards of the two companies approved terms of the deal in September of that year. It received regulatory approval from the Justice Department’s antitrust division and from European regulators.Delta announced in March of this year that the flight to Amsterdam, inaugurated in 1995 and giving the Bluff City huge international cachet, would be converted to a summer-only schedule. Then, in October, the airline dropped the flight from the schedule completely.Similarly, in a Memphis Daily News article of June 2008, Anderson was quoted saying Memphis would be an integral hub of the merged airline: ""The consolidation is about addition, not subtraction."" The article was one of many from that time noting that, ""Anderson said the move could even bring more flights to the city, especially international flights, considering the long list of worldwide cities now served by the two companies.""At the time, the cheering section included Memphis Airport Authority chairman Arnold Perl, who was quoted as saying, ""The Northwest-Delta merger is great for Memphis, great for the Memphis region, great for Tennessee and great for the United States.""To many in Memphis, including  those among the 6,000 members of the anti-Delta Facebook group, ""Delta Does Memphis,"" the merger now seems more grating than great.Northwest Airlines flew 240 flights out of Memphis before being acquired by Delta in 2008. In June of this year, Delta announced it would chop 25 flights from Memphis out of its schedule, leaving the hub with 46 percent fewer flights than when the merger took effect. Memphis International Airport chief financial officer Forrest Artz reported that, in September, daily Delta flights were down to 122, compared to 175 the same month a year earlier.For its part, Delta blames other factors beyond the merger for the reduced flights. ""Any operational assurance that Delta provided officials was under the understating that any action to the contrary would not be directly related to the merger,"" Delta spokesman Anthony L. Black said by email. ""Specifically, raising fuel costs, the current international economic environment, lack of passenger demand and profitability have been the primary drivers of all network restructuring.""While Delta may now claim that any assurances it gave were conditioned by any number of factors, people in Memphis thought they had a deal that meant a strengthened hub and a continued flight to Europe, and maybe more. The facts are the Delta Air Lines CEO said the Memphis-Amsterdam flight would continue. It was first curtailed to summer-only, then chloroformed. That’s a broken promise.Next, the Delta point man said Memphis would remain an integral hub of the new merged airline and might even have ""more flights to the city."" The number of flights has dropped from 240 to 122, a 49 percent decline.Whatever the circumstances, these qualify as broken promises.Our rulingMemphis Congressman Steve Cohen accuses Delta of breaking promises made to him and the city of Memphis about the impact of its merger with Northwest.

With so much at stake, such a large enterprise is closely watched by the state’s top politicos.The spotlight fell last month on the Georgia Lottery Board when one of its members resigned because she thought the panel was feeling pressured to hire Gov. Nathan Deal’s budget director as the next lottery chief.The new chief, Debbie Dlugolenski Alford, a former director of the state’s Office of Planning and Budget and a member of the lottery board, had never worked for a lottery. Some officials, including a state Senate leader, questioned the selection and Alford’s qualifications.Deal spokesman Brian Robinson dismissed the criticism, telling an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter that half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired. Ultimately, the state lottery board unanimously confirmed Alford for the job Oct. 25.We wondered whether Robinson’s claim was accurate. How many of the jurisdictions operating lotteries had directors without previous lottery experience? Was this an acceptable practice in the industry to roll the dice on an untested leader? And did a background in other professional fields qualify as related experience?The Georgia Lottery Corp. has been in operation for 19 years and has sales exceeding $45 billion, according to information on the lottery’s website. Of that amount, more than $13.8 billion has been transferred to the state’s Lottery for Education Account. At any given time, Georgia’s lottery operates nine online or computerized games and about 40 instant ticket games.We asked Robinson for any documentation to support his claim. The governor’s office provided a chart of lottery directors in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data, compiled by the governor’s office with a July 24 date, included a list of lottery CEOs and their former or concurrent occupation. The chart also included a background column on whether the CEO had lottery experience.When asked, an office spokeswoman did not explain how the office qualified lottery experience, and whether it was based on any specific requirement such as length of time in office, training or related professional work.Not content to take the governor’s office chart at face value, we did our own research on the 46 lottery chiefs listed on the chart. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that 22 directors on the list appeared to have no previous lottery experience, including the directors for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands lotteries. The limited background information found on those two directors did not appear to include any previous lottery experience.For the most part, the governor’s office was accurate in its assessments, if previous lottery experience included sitting on a lottery board or commission, or serving in some other job for the same state lottery, such as legal counsel.In a few cases, the chart information was incorrect based on our research of online biographies, related media articles or announcements and the lotteries’ websites. For example, the chart lists former Georgia Lottery chief Margaret deFrancisco as having no previous lottery experience. In fact, DeFrancisco had been director of the New York Lottery before coming to Atlanta. And the governor’s office listed Arizona’s lottery executive director, Jeff Hatch-Miller, as having previous experience, but his biography included no mention of previous lottery work. Hatch-Miller’s experience included time served on the state commission in charge of regulating utilities and time spent in the Arizona Legislature.Overall, the operation of lotteries is done at the state level. There is no overarching organization or federal department with regulatory authority. Within the industry, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Geneva, Ohio, acts as the trade group for lotteries and provides support to lottery administrators. Membership consists of jurisdictions operating lotteries, including 43 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, five Canadian provinces and Mexico.Qualifications for lottery directors or CEOs are determined by the states, said David Gale, the NASPL’s executive director. The NASPL does not keep statistics on lottery directors’ backgrounds.""With past experience you’ll find a mix. There are some directors without previous lottery experience, but they have some business, budgeting and security experience that is significant in operating a lottery,"" Gale said. Also notable, he said, some of the top lottery positions are appointed positions that can be political appointments.Direct experience in operating a lottery is not irrelevant, but it is only one of many qualities to consider in a CEO’s role, said Paul Jason, director of the Public Research Gaming Institute. A director with ties to the governor’s office or state legislature could be important in navigating between those offices and personalities and the lottery corporation, he said.Georgia’s lottery has a ""deep bench"" of talented top management that can deal with the management of the lottery and can help the incoming director, making direct experience unnecessary [for the director], Jason said.So let’s review. Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, shunned criticism about the state’s new lottery director having no previous lottery experience when selected for the job last month. Robinson told a newspaper reporter that half the country’s lottery directors had not run lotteries before taking the top job.Robinson’s claim is correct -- in most cases. There is some room for interpretation.Still, we rate Robinson’s statement Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkGeorgia Lotterystated on January 24, 2013 in on a ticketOdds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27.By Janel Davis • February 1, 2013","https://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/alford-named-head-of-georgia-lottery/nSnsC/,https://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/alford-named-head-of-georgia-lottery/nSnsC/,http://www.galottery.com/about-us,/personalities/georgia-lottery/,/factchecks/2013/feb/01/georgia-lottery/when-it-comes-lottery-tickets-not-losing-winning/",,"Georgia,Lottery,Brian Robinson",,,,,

Paul Ryan’s Medicare reform plan,,politifact,,"In the homestretch of the U.S. Senate race, Republican Tommy Thompson offered a plan to slow rising Medicare costs that threaten the solvency of the government-run health insurance program for seniors.The ""Tommy Thompson plan,"" as he called it, would give future seniors the option of staying in the program or joining one of the private health plans offered to federal employees.The campaign of his opponent Democrat Tammy Baldwin cried foul, saying Thompson was ""trying to run away from"" his firm embrace of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s controversial plan to reform Medicare.Another case for the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether candidates have changed their position. As usual, we’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent.In the 2012 race, Thompson has ripped Baldwin for failing to propose a solvency plan for Medicare. Baldwin, in turn, has tried at every turn to link the former governor to Ryan’s plan, which critics paint as ""ending Medicare as we know it.""Ryan’s  ""Path to Prosperity"" budget resolution in 2012 -- the latest in a series of similar fiscal plans he’s released in recent years -- included proposed changes in tax policy and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.Ryan’s plan, which is nearly identical to Mitt Romney’s, allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice. They can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.Critics call this a ""voucher"" plan that could leave seniors dipping deeper into their own pockets, while Ryan says it’s a ""premium support"" plan that will lower health care costs.Let’s look at Thompson’s statements and actions:October 2011: Thompson, already an unofficial Senate candidate, says an earlier version of Ryan’s budget plan, this one in 2011, was ""on the right track"". But unlike Ryan in that earlier plan, Thompson makes clear he wanted to give people under 55 a choice of staying on traditional Medicare or not when they reached retirement age. Thompson did not have a formal plan at the time.Thompson says those who chose the traditional system would pay higher-out-of-pocket costs than seniors pay now because the system ""is going broke.""  March 29, 2012: The House approves Ryan’s budget plan on a 228-191 partisan vote. The plan’s Medicare proposal -- modified from Ryan’s earlier plan -- offered the choice of using a government payment for private insurance or for a plan akin to traditional Medicare.May 11-13, 2012: At the Republican Party state convention, Thompson endorses Ryan’s 2013 budget plan as a whole.

I think my plan is better.""Oct. 23, 2012: The Journal Sentinel, in a story entitled, ""How Thompson, Baldwin differ on Medicare,"" writes that Thompson for months touted a plan that would allow people a decade from now to remain in the current program or receive a subsidy from the government to buy health insurance from the private sector. ""In recent weeks, he has modified his course by saying he wants to allow people to stay in Medicare or sign up for the private healthcare plans offered to federal employees,"" the story said.Oct. 26, 2012: In the final Senate debate, Thompson again outlines his plan, changing a detail: those under 50 in the year 2020 would get the choice. Thompson said Democrats’ plan was to ""play our harp while Rome burns and see Medicare collapse,"" while Baldwin said the federal health care law she backed had improved Medicare’s fiscal outlook.Our ratingThompson has praised Ryan’s various Medicare plans since 2011, and for much of the  2012 campaign indicated he fully embraced Ryan’s latest plan.In the last month or so he’s partially changed his approach on Medicare reform, while edging away from Ryan. Really, though, he has only tweaked Ryan’s Medicare plan, and has not renounced Ryan’s budget blueprint -- Thompson still endorses it on his website.That amounts to a Half Flip on our meter.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021","http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pathtoprosperity2013.pdf,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/119960329.html,http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74651.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqGr2q5qCV4,http://tommyforwisconsin.com/issues/spending/,http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/thompson-admits-he-doesn-t-know-if-medicare-plan-would/article_bb836034-1a33-11e2-988c-0019bb2963f4.html,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/how-thompson-baldwin-differ-on-medicare-ru791r8-175519061.html,http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/thompson-admits-he-doesn-t-know-if-medicare-plan-would/article_bb836034-1a33-11e2-988c-0019bb2963f4.html,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"Federal Budget,Health Care,Medicare,Wisconsin,Tommy Thompson",,,,,

The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent.""",,politifact,,"With what sometimes appears to be an unlimited supply of money to spend on campaign commercials, Dr. George Flinn is flooding the airwaves trying to make voters in the 9th Congressional District reconsider returning the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, to Washington, D.C.In a campaign mailershowing the crumbling edifice of a large brick building, Flinn, the state’s biggest campaign self-funder, provides voters with numbers that indicate the unemployment rate in Shelby County is more than twice as bad now as it was when Cohen began in Congress. The 9th is comprised mostly of Memphis, with some parts of northern Shelby County, and recent national media reports have pointed out that Cohen is one of the few southern white Democrats remaining in Congress.""When Congressman Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent,"" reads one bullet point. And then the very next one says, ""The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent.""The Cohen campaign has challenged the veracity of many claims by Flinn, a radiologist who has built his wealth by owning radio stations and spent millions on various campaigns since 2002. Cohen’s campaign says the mailer contains numbers that are both out of context and inaccurate. So we asked the Flinn campaign for evidence.On statements like this, where statistics are used in an attempt to assign someone credit or blame, it is PolitiFact policy to a) determine the accuracy of the numbers and b) the extent to which the designation of credit or blame is accurate.Flinn spokeswoman Kristi Stanley defended the mailer and said the numbers came straight from federal statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.But when we double-checked, we found that the Cohen campaign was closer to the truth -- Flinn’s campaign either misread the statistics or cherry-picked other numbers from the years 2007 (when Cohen took office) and 2012 (the current election year).Cohen officially took office as the 9th Congressional District representative in January of 2007, following his election in November of 2006 to succeed five-term Congressman Harold Ford Jr.  The originally reported unemployment rate for Shelby County for January of 2007 was 5.5 percent. When it was later revised, the new numberwas 5.7 percent. Either way, a significant distance from the 4.8 percent listed on the mailer.What about the unemployment rate now? The 9.7 percent figure used by the Flinn campaign appears to be pegged to reports for July, but the unemployment rate by August dropped to 9.0 percent in Shelby County.Those numbers for August did not become available until Sept. 27, so it’s possible the mailer was prepared with only the July numbers available. In any case, the most recent figures reported on Oct. 25 show the unemployment rate for Shelby County had dropped to 8.4 percent, following national trends.As to whether Cohen deserves blame for the unemployment rate’s worsening in Shelby County since arriving in D.C. in January of 2007, we reached out to some economists and consulted similar PolitiFact rulings involving other elected officials.Malcolm Getz, an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, put it this way in an email: ""One member of Congress has 1/435 of the vote in the House of Representatives. Whatever passes the House must also pass the Senate. The system is designed to allow many voices to be heard and counted with no single voice having determinative effect.""And: ""Macroeconomic phenomena like the unemployment rate is strongly influenced by events outside of government control.""Economics professor John Gnuschke, head of the University of Memphis’s Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research, had a similar reaction: ""A single Congressman doesn't have the ability to change the direction of the economy or the recovery.""Gnuschke wrote further that ""economic conditions in Memphis mirrored those in the rest of the nation and were in no way unique. . . . Improvements locally have been slow because the nation's recovery from the Great Recession has been slow. Congressman Cohen was not the cause of the decline and is not the problem with the slow recovery. Look to a weak private sector and their unwillingness to hire and invest as the issue of the day.""  Google makes it possible to create charts that show the unemployment rate over time, and you can compare different geographies. When you match up the unemployment rates for the United States, Tennessee, Shelby County and Memphis, you get four lines that rise and fall consistently at about the same rate.The Cohen campaign strongly believes Cohen does not deserve blame for the numbers, and points to examples that it says represent actions that improved the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County.Cohen campaign manager John Marek wrote in an email: ""Congressman Cohen brought us Tennessee’s first Minority Business Center, which will give racial minorities and women more access to business loans, which means jobs. Congressman Cohen also saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis, and he created many jobs in Memphis when he brought us the $15 million Tiger grant, which will be a big development project downtown. He supported President Obama's jobs bill, which was blocked by Republicans in Congress.""Marek also made this point -- Flinn was a Shelby County Commissioner from 2004 to 2010: ""Arguably a County Mayor and County legislature would have more to do with the unemployment numbers than a Federal Congressman.""Flinn’s campaign stands by the mailer and says Cohen has not delivered.Our rulingIn a campaign mailer, Republican congressional candidate George Flinn blamed Steve Cohen for the unemployment rate in Shelby County being more than twice as bad now (4.8 percent to 9.7 percent) than it was in 2007 when he took office.But Flinn’s numbers are off, no matter if you stop the clock at the July numbers or the more recent September numbers. Further, the campaign overreaches by trying to pin responsibility for Shelby County’s economic collapse and then gradual recovery on one elected official.

Bush.""Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election,"" said undecided voter Susan Katz. ""What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?""Romney detailed several ways he would depart from Bush’s policies, then President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Romney was actually further to the right than Bush.""George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Gov. Romney and George Bush,"" Obama said, as one example.Planned Parenthood provides low-cost reproductive health services but is also the nation’s leading provider of abortions. Romney and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate its federal funding, a move Obama opposes.But where did the 43rd president stand on the subject? We decided to check it out.Planned Parenthood and federal fundingThe organization, founded in 1921, has received federal funds since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed a law amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information.Planned Parenthood now operates more than 800 clinics in all 50 states. The bulk of their work is women’s health care: cancer screenings, STD treatment, sex education, contraceptives, pregnancy care and breast exams. In many states, they also perform abortions -- more than 330,000 a year. The group receives millions in federal money every year, in the form of grants and reimbursements for the health services its provides. In 2009, its federal funding totalled $360 million. Planned Parenthood says abortions account for 3 percent of its services, which are prohibited from being paid for with public money. The group says it is careful to keep the money separate.Still, it’s that 3 percent that makes it a target in the national abortion battle.What Bush didIn one of his first acts as president, Bush reinstated what is known as the Mexico City policy, or (as abortion rights advocates called it) the global gag rule, in January 2001. The rule denies money to overseas family planning clinics (such as Planned Parenthood’s international arm) that provide abortion counseling in foreign countries.At the end of Bush’s term, International Planned Parenthood Federation said that during those eight years, they lost more than $100 million for family planning and health programs. The consequence of losing those funds, the group said: 36 million unplanned pregnancies and 15 million induced abortions.When Obama took office, he revoked the Mexico City policy.What Bush didn’t doAs president, Bush called himself a ""compassionate conservative"" and spoke of supporting ""a culture of life."" He steered money to faith-based groups, and he signed a federal ban on late-term abortions in 2003. When he ran for re-election in 2004, Planned Parenthood endorsed Democrat John Kerry, the first time the group formally backed a presidential candidate.That said, we searched media reports from Bush’s eight years in office and found no instances of the president pushing to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood’s work in the United States. We contacted Planned Parenthood itself, which also couldn’t cite evidence of Bush targeting their federal money.On the contrary, we found ample evidence that Bush was satisfied with the status quo. In 1999, when he was first running for president, he declined to sign a pledge to defund Planned Parenthood, saying he supported ""incremental changes helpful to America's pro-life movement.""The Obama campaign also pointed us to information on Title X funding (which pays for the health services Planned Parenthood provides) during the Bush years.His 2002 budget proposal eliminated contraceptive coverage for federal employees but maintained funding for Title X, including $66 million for Planned Parenthood. A budget bill he signed in 2007 provided ""the largest increase in Title X family planning funding since 2000, a $16.8 million increase from the previous year,"" according to a Planned Parenthood press release.Romney’s stanceEliminating funding for Planned Parenthood has gotten more attention since a Republican majority, backed by the new tea party wave of conservatism, took control of the House of Representatives in 2011.""This is when we're going to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the season for us to do this,"" Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., said in February 2011. (Stearns later lost his primary battle to a more ardent tea party candidate.)The House voted in February 2011 to block Planned Parenthood funding, and all money for family planning. (The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the package.) The message also caught on in the Republican presidential primary contest. Newt Gingrich, at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner that same month, said, ""I would immediately move to defund Planned Parenthood and take that money and devote it to adoption services to create an alternative to abortion.""Romney, for his part, has repeatedly pledged to revoke Planned Parenthood’s funding. His website says he would ""eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding — Savings: $300 Million. Title X subsidizes family planning programs that benefit abortion groups like Planned Parenthood.""And after he told the Des Moines Register on Oct. 9, 2012, that there’s no abortion legislation on his agenda, he was forced to re-state his anti-abortion stance: ""The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I’ve indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president.""With the spotlight on the organization, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told the Washington Post in August, ""I’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve never seen a presidential election where women’s basic access to birth control is practically on the ballot. Defunding Planned Parenthood is practically on the ballot. It’s been incredible to witness the last year and a half and this debate we’ve had over access to care. ... This is not something that John McCain was campaigning to do. George Bush wasn’t either. I’ve never seen anything quite like it.""Our rulingObama said in the debate that, ""George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.""In fact, one of Bush’s first acts as president was to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and other groups working overseas that counsel women about abortion. But as for eliminating Title X funding for health services that Planned Parenthood provides in the United States -- which is what Romney and other Republicans of today favor -- Obama is right. We found no evidence that Bush sought such a change, and Title X funding actually increased during his presidency.We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

""Didn't even file it.""""This is one of the promises we’ve tracked in the Obamameter, and Romney is correct.During the 2008 campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""   But the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called a ""a very important step.""   Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state.

As the Arab spring rippled across the region in early 2011, Syria began to experience unrest, with protests emerging both in the capital, Damascus, and Deraa, a relatively remote city near the Jordanian border.What happened in Deraa in March 2011 became the spark that ignited a widespread revolt that has now morphed into a bloody civil war.Several schoolchildren were arrested in late February 2011, accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said ""the people want to topple the regime,"" according to CNN. When residents found out that the boys were beaten and tortured in prison, they sought their release but were rebuffed.On March 18, security forces opened fire on protesters in Deraa, killing at least four, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Within days, the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people,"" according to Human Rights Watch.The comment Ryan referenced came just over a week after the killings in Deraa, on the March 27, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, which included an appearance by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Schieffer asked Clinton how the situation in Syria was different than in Libya, where the U.S. took action against a repressive government.Clinton: ""Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don’t think that it’s yet clear what will occur. What will unfold? There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer. What’s been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning. But there’s a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities, then police actions, which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see.""The comments quickly drew criticism in some quarters. For instance, four days later, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote, ""Few things said by this administration in its two years can match this one for moral bankruptcy and strategic incomprehensibility. … It was hoped that President Assad would be a reformer when he inherited his father’s dictatorship a decade ago. … Wrong. Assad has run the same iron-fisted Alawite police state as did his father,"" Hafez Assad.We will not judge the wisdom of what Clinton said, but rather analyze whether Ryan correctly characterized what she did say.Ryan did get the timing right. Though the conflict would eventually get much bloodier, Syrian guns had already killed several people in Deraa by the time Clinton made her comment. In fact, the show opened with a report from Tripoli covering the spread of the Arab spring, with the reporter saying that Syria’s government acknowledged that 12 people were killed, more than 200 wounded as protests and demonstrations spread across that country.""As for invoking ""Russian-provided guns,"" it certainly sounds plausible. Russia is Syria’s biggest supplier of weaponry, and Russia’s arms trade with Syria totaled about $1.5 billion, making Damascus Moscow’s seventh-largest client, according to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.Where Ryan may have gone too far was in saying that the administration ""called Bashar Assad a reformer."" While Clinton did use the word, she said, ""Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer.""So, Clinton didn’t exactly say that she, or the administration, was labeling Assad a reformer. Rather, she was referring to what other people -- namely ""lawmakers"" --""believe.""Our rulingRyan said the Obama administration ""called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.""That’s not quite what Clinton said; instead, she was describing what she understood lawmakers’ views to be. Still, as a secretary of state speaking on national television, her decision to discuss such beliefs without knocking them down suggests that she lends them at least some credibility. On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

They have argued over the treatment of the middle class, small businesses and whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent. The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point -- the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas.So far, this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign, although American-based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome. By one conservative estimate, this part of the tax code is worth $30 billion a year.During the debate, Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas.""When it comes to our tax code, Gov. Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.""Romney responded, ""The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.""In this fact-check, we'll examine the president’s statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations.In the narrowest sense possible, Romney’s rebuttal is accurate. There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond U.S. borders. But if a plant moves at all, whether it’s from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia, it is eligible for deductions.""There is certainly a tax break for U.S. companies that move operations or people abroad,"" said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. ""It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense.""Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, went even further.""A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions,"" Harvey said. ""In addition, the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a U.S. operation.""But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations. There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS. Tax break #1: Keeping profits overseasWhen an American firm opens a foreign division, it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay U.S. taxes.""That foreign subsidiary is a new entity, organized and created in a foreign country, ""said McGill. ""And responsible for its own taxes."" Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent company’s tax return.The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where it's located. Those rates are often lower than in the U.S., where the corporate rate is 35 percent. So long as profits remain overseas, U.S. taxes are deferred.The company can declare that none of that money will return to the U.S.McGill, along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe, picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high-tech companies such as Google and IBM. With Apple, they found the company had built up $23.4 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently. And for good reason: Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 1.2 percent on those profits.Tax break #2: Selling to yourselfAn American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill. All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves. It’s perfectly legal and very lucrative. Take the example of Google.In just one quarter, the owner of the world’s most popular search engine had nearly $2.8 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the U.S. That would put Google in good shape regardless, but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable. In 2009, the company’s foreign tax rate was 2.4 percent, reported Bloomberg News.Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world. The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent. But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0.6 percent. The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda.These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arm’s length. Harvey, the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner, said they are anything but.""It is relatively clear most U.S. multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low-tax jurisdictions,"" Harvey said. ""I believe that anyone who believes the IRS can effectively enforce the arm’s-length standard is an eternal optimist — or delusional.""Tallying the costHarvey said the tax tools that multinationals can use give them a competitive advantage over domestic firms. He points to the work of Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit news service. Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between $30 billion to $60 billion a year.Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment.""Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 1.9 million. Over the same period U.S. multinationals increased their employment overseas by 2.4 million,"" Sullivan said.But the picture is more complicated than that might seem. There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts. Some analysts, including Harvey, believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe.However, regardless of the initial motivation, once companies make the move, in Sullivan’s words, ""a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow.""Our rulingPresident Obama said there are ""loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.""Independent analysts agree that firms with international operations can take advantage of tax loopholes that domestic firms can not. The value of these is in the billions. Such tax laws might not be the deciding factor for companies to locate in foreign countries, but they make that choice more lucrative.We rate the statement True.Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html,/personalities/tom-wolf/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/",,"National,Debates,Jobs,Taxes,Barack Obama",,,,,

""We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 jobs, auto jobs in Ohio.""A loss of jobs? PolitiFact Ohio was interested.We looked at figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we asked Kasich's office for his sourcing.First, we noted that Kasich, in talking about ""the last year and three-quarters,"" was referring to the period from January 2011, when he took office, until August 2012, the last month for which figures were available.BLS figures for Ohio show that total nonfarm employment went in that period from 5,064,600 to 5,187,600 -- an increase of 123,000 jobs, as Kasich stated.In talking about auto jobs in that period, Kasich's staff said he was referring to jobs in the BLS categories of motor vehicle manufacturing and motor vehicle parts manufacturing.The first category saw an increase of 700 jobs from January 2011 to August 2012, from 19,200 to 19,900.In the second and larger category, employment went from 56,000 to 54,800, a loss of 1,200 jobs.That's a net decrease of 500 jobs.So Kasich’s numbers are correct. But additional information is needed to clarify his claim.The timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself, as we have noted before. In talking about Ohio jobs, the governor only used figures that covered his time in office, starting in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama.The auto industry hit bottom in June 2009, when vehicle manufacturing jobs in Ohio dropped to 14,200, down from 23,800 jobs one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office, after the auto bailouts, that number had increased by 5,000 jobs. That isn't reflected in the governor's tally.Parts manufacturing, down 1,200 jobs since Kasich took office, is up 3,900 jobs from the trough of June 2009.It is also worth noting that the figures the governor cited reflect only direct jobs in the auto industry. Some industry analysts, such as the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, also look at two other categories of employment in the industry -- intermediate and spin-off -- in considering the impact auto manufacturing has on the economy. Under that gauge, job growth in other businesses that have a connection to the auto industry also would be considered.On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information rates Mostly True.","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Ohio,Economy,Jobs,John Kasich",,,,,

In the wake of a federal court decision that restored absentee voting the weekend before Election Day for military and civilian voters, DeWine was ready to duke it out in court some more. At an Aug. 31 news conference, DeWine expressed his displeasure with the decision by a federal judge which ruled that all Ohio voters would get a chance to vote in-person absentee the weekend before Election Day. As attorney for the state, DeWine's office had argued that only military voters should be eligible to vote in-person absentee but the judge ruled otherwise stating that to allow only one group of voters access to the polls amounted to unequal protection under the law.The judge's decision in Obama v. Husted was an affirmation of the position of President Barack Obama's campaign which had argued that you couldn't treat military voters any different than other voters. But DeWine disagreed, and as he spoke at his news conference about the state's appeal he cited what he said was a long history of absentee voting for military members. ""Since the time of the Civil War, we've made a distinction in this country between the availability and the ability to access for people who were in the military, versus the rest of us, to vote,"" DeWine said.  ""And we've made that distinction because of the unique situation the people in the military are in. We've done this now for about 150 years, and so this is not anything new."" Really? Has the United State allowed absentee voting by military members dating back to the Civil War?We decided to rustle up our musket, our finest blue and gray duds and check it out for ourselves.   We first turned to DeWine's office who responded quickly with a few references from legal briefs filed with the court. Several footnotes to the legal briefs mentioned the same source--a University of Michigan Law Review Journal article by John C. Fortier and Norman Ornstein.  The article, entitled The Absentee Ballot and the Secret Ballot: Challenges for Election Reform, traces the history of absentee voting in the United States. And lo and behold, the authors find the Civil War was largely the starting point for absentee voting laws. ""The early impetus behind absentee balloting was war; making sure that soldiers on the battlefield were not disenfranchised by their military service,"" it states. ""The Civil War inspired the first major effort for absentee balloting in the United States.""  Fortier and Ornstein tally up 19 of 25 Union states and 7 of 11 states in the southern confederacy as having had absentee voting laws for soldiers during the Civil War. Prior to the Civil War, it appears that only Pennsylvania had military absentee voting thanks to a law passed in 1813, which allowed soldiers stationed more than two miles away from home to vote absentee, the authors state. Furthermore, one of the citations provided by DeWine's office points to a U.S. Court of Appeals decision which references the Civil War as the starting point. ""Absentee voting began during the Civil War as a means of providing soldiers the right to vote,"" reads a snippet of the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals 2001 decision in Voting Integrity Project v. Kielsing. So it seems clear the Civil War was the starting point for all but Pennsylvania. But that doesn't mean those laws stayed on the books as DeWine implies. Turning again to Fortier and Ornstein, the authors state ""these laws applied only to military voting, and most were discontinued after the end of the (Civil) War."" A scholarly article co-authored by Daniel Tokaji, an OSU professor, arrives at much the same conclusion. ""Yet, according to a 1915 survey, absentee ballots disappeared after the Civil War, to the point that only six states retained military absentee voting statutes,"" it reads. This had changed drastically by 1924, when all but three states had absentee voting laws on the books for military and civilians, the article states.  Reached at his Columbus office, Tokaji said absentee voting for the military largely began in the Civil War but did not continue unnterrupted for the last 150 years. ""There has been some waxing and waning over the years,"" he said. ""It's not a story of steady progress over the years as time has marched on."" So where does that leave us? At a news conference following a federal court decision that cited equal protection law and ordered absentee voting for all voters the weekend before Election Day, Mike DeWine said the decision was wrong. In part, DeWine said that was because military voters and civilian voters have been treated differently dating back to the Civil War. He also implied that it has been that way uninterrupted since the Civil War. The historical record seems to be undisputed that absentee voting for the military went from being allowed only in Pennsylvania prior to the Civil War to being allowed in most Union states and a majority of the confederacy during the Civil War.  However, those laws were repealed in most states following the Civil War. By 1915 only six states still had military absentee voting. That changed in the decade that followed and those laws appear to have stayed on the books ever since allowing absentee voting access for military voters. DeWine was partially correct. Special absentee voting privileges have been extended to military voters dating back to the Civil War. However, he also implied that those laws have been on the books for the past 150 years. This is true only in a handful of states, the vast majority of states had to reenact military voting statutes after 1915.  That’s important information his claim leaves out that put the statement in full context.On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s claim rates Half True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 26, 2021 in a viral video""In March 2020 the United States deployed 30,000 troops to Europe to ... free child-trafficked children and arrest deep state cabal members.""By Madison Czopek • January 29, 2021","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/troops-werent-sent-europe-free-trafficked-children/",,"Ohio,Elections,Military,Mike DeWine",,,,,

When we asked the Brown campaign for supporting sources, they cited a fact-check by us and another by our friends at FactCheck.org. When we looked further, we found a third related fact-check by PolitiFact Ohio.The first item, from October 2011, reviewed the claim in a Mandel campaign email about the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion through which the state treasurer invests money for local governments.The campaign email said the STAR Ohio fund ""just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.""The source for the claim was the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, which sent the state a letter in August 2011 affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund.While that is the highest possible rating, STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund. Public finance experts told us the treasurer deserved credit for maintaining the bond rating but did not ""achieve"" it.We found then that a reader could reasonably assume from his email that the rating had gone up. Because the rating already had been in place for 16 years and did not improve under Mandel, we said his email overstated the case. We rated the statement Half True.FactCheck.org, in May 2012, looked at a Mandel ad that said he ""earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer.""That statement ""could give viewers the impression that Mandel improved the state’s credit ratings, but that is not the case,"" FactCheck.org concluded. ""Under Mandel, the state’s STAR Ohio investment fund has maintained its 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor’s. But even the state treasurer’s office acknowledges that the fund has had that same rating since 1995.""We also looked at that same ad statement last May, and found it more carefully worded than the claim in the email we examined earlier. Unlike the email, the statement did not imply that the credit rating had ""just"" improved.Because the statement was accurate but needed for clarification the additional information that the rating had been AAAm for 16 years, we rated it Mostly True.That brings us back to the Brown campaign’s TV ad.First, it is important to know that the fund already had achieved the highest possible rating. There was not room for improvement in the rating, as could be reasonably inferred from the TV ad.More importantly, though, the ad targets Mandel’s character, questioning his truthfulness, and makes the claim that he ""is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved.""Ohio's investment fund has not improved under Mandel. And a natural reading of that claim is that Mandel at some point claimed it had improved.Except in the materials the Brown campaign cited in support of the ad, Mandel doesn’t actually say the rating went up. But that’s the clear implication the ad makes when it says he is now lying about his record.And PolitiFact Ohio has never heard him make that claim.PolitiFact Ohio previously rated as Mostly True the claim by Mandel's campaign that he ""earned the highest possible credit ratings"" for investment funds managed by the treasurer's office.  We found that the claim needed additional information for clarification, but that it was accurate.When we rated Mandel’s claim in his email Half True for overstatement, that was for his use of the words """"just received,"" which we said could give the impression that the rating was new. He did not say in that email that the rating for the STAR Ohio fund had gone up.While the claims put the best possible spin on Mandel's performance, they do not qualify as ""lying about his record.""

The real unemployment rate is 19 percent.""",,politifact,,"A campaign ad by the pro-Mitt Romney group Restore Our Future blames President Barack Obama not only for the current high rate of unemployment, but also for leading many Americans to simply stop looking for jobs.""Millions of Americans are disappearing from the work force because they can't find jobs,"" the ad says. ""The overall unemployment rate doesn't even count them any more. Eight million Americans have dropped out of the workforce since Obama became president. Counting people who dropped out or can't find full-time jobs, the real unemployment rate is 19 percent.""Everybody knows the jobs bounceback from the most recent recession has been frustratingly modest. But have eight million Americans really ""dropped out of the work force since Obama became president""? And has that left the ""real"" unemployment rate at 19 percent?Restore Our Future, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on what went into the group’s calculation. But the ad itself did offer its source: a Wall Street Journal column from Sept. 7, 2012, by businessman and editor Mortimer Zuckerman. Zuckerman wrote:""How many people are out of work but not counted as unemployed because they hadn't sought work in the past four weeks? Eight million. ... The key indicator of our employment health, in all the statistics, is what the government calls U-6. This is the number who have applied for work in the past six months and includes people who are involuntary part-time workers — government-speak for those individuals whose jobs have been cut back to two or three days a week. They are working part-time only because they've been unable to find full-time work. This involuntary army of what's called ‘underutilized labor’ has been hovering for months at about 15 percent of the workforce. Include the eight million who have simply given up looking, and the real unemployment rate is closer to 19 percent.""Zuckerman didn’t answer our inquiries. But we’ll look at the two pieces of the claim -- the 8 million and the 19 percent -- in order.Eight million labor-force dropoutsThe eight million figure has been bouncing around the conservative blogosphere in recent weeks, such as a widely shared column from Investor’s Business Daily that said that during the Obama recovery, ""the ranks of those who aren't in the labor force at all have swelled by nearly 8 million.""We were able to track down a Bureau of Labor Statistics category that jibes with the 8 million claim. Called ""not in labor force,"" this statistic counts people age 16 years and older who are neither employed nor unemployed. (Being unemployed, according to BLS, means being available for work and having looked for work sometime during the previous four weeks.)Between Obama’s inauguration and today, a 44-month period, the number of Americans ""not in the labor force"" rose by 8.4 million. Using a slightly different time frame -- starting the count at the end of the recession in June 2009 -- produces a rise of almost exactly 8 million. So the figure has a grain of truth.But what does this number really mean? For starters, it’s actually not a measurement of people who ""can’t find jobs"" -- at least not entirely. In addition to discouraged job-seekers, it includes parents who decided to become a full-time mom or dad. It includes people who have decided to go back to school. And it includes people who have chosen to retire.There’s no question that some of these decisions may have been influenced by a perception of weak job prospects ahead. But people make these career-changing decisions all the time; if you’re going to lay the blame for a shrinking workforce on today’s economy, it’s important to tell how much more common labor-market departures are now compared to what would have been happening in a more ""normal"" job market. The retirement numbers are particularly important, given the aging of the baby-boomer workforce.Fortunately, there’s a way to get a rough sense of this, by looking at the trendline over a longer period of time.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021For the 44 months prior to January 2009, people left the labor force at a stable, predictable rate -- in fact, essentially the same rate back to 2002. During that time, 3.8 million people left the labor force. So if you consider this the ""normal"" amount of departures from the labor force over 44 months, Obama’s presidency has seen departures increase by an ""extra"" 4.6 million.This 4.6 million number checks out if you look at the trendline for the civilian labor force -- that is, the number of people who are either employed or officially unemployed. After a steady rise through January 2009, this number has flatlined. If you were to extend the same pace of growth after January 2009 as there was before, the labor force would have had almost exactly 4.6 million extra members today.Bottom line: An extra 4.6 million people leaving the labor force (or never joining it in the first place) is still a big number. But it’s not 8 million.A 19 percent ""real"" unemployment rateThe statistic Zuckerman referred to in his column -- the U-6 unemployment rate -- is sometimes offered as a more ""complete"" picture of joblessness. It doesn’t just include those who BLS officially considers ""unemployed"" but also those working part time for economic reasons as well as those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force (meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force).Currently, the U-6 rate of ""labor underutilization"" -- which is the broadest measure of unemployment and under-employment that BLS calculates -- is 14.7 percent. That’s a whole lot higher than the more familiar 8.1 percent unemployment rate, but it’s also well below the 19 percent claimed in the ad. As we can see from Zuckerman’s column, he has reached 19 percent by taking U-6 as his base and then broadening its definition of under-employment. The ad then ran with his calculation.Labor economists we interviewed said that what Zuckerman did is fine in theory. Even though U-6 is the broadest measurement of under-employment that BLS calculates, it still doesn’t capture everyone affected by a bad job market, such as recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them.The problem is that no reasonable expansion of U-6 gets the figure as high as 19 percent.First, as we noted above, the more accurate figure to use for labor-force dropouts due to economic conditions is 4.6 million, not 8 million. Second, a big chunk of these 4.6 million are already counted in BLS’ basic U-6 calculation -- they’re ""marginally attached"" workers. In the most recent month, the marginally attached numbered 2.6 million. So to avoid double-counting, you have to subtract 2.6 million.This leaves 2 million labor-force dropouts to add to the existing U-6 calculation. Running the new numbers -- perhaps we can call this new statistic ""U-7"" -- produces an under-employment rate of 16 percent, not 19 percent.Again, this is just about double the already high ""official"" unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. But it’s not, as the ad claimed, 19 percent.Our ratingRestore Our Future’s ad spotlights a reasonable attempt to quantify some of the hidden victims of today’s weak labor market. But due to errors of concept and calculation, the final numbers cited in the ad are too high. A more accurate measure of workforce dropouts due to the weak job market is 4.6 million, not 8 million, and what the ad would call the ""real"" unemployment rate is actually about 16 percent, not 19 percent. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJSy1d0OQgg&feature=youtu.be,https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444273704577635681206305056.html,http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/082412-623476-obama-so-called-recovery-leaving-middle-class-behind.htm,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"National,Economy,Jobs,Message Machine 2012,Restore Our Future",,,,,

Robert Menendez ""voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%.""""In 2010 Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a brand-new tax on the sale of homes. Sen. Bob Menendez voted for this during one of the most horrific housing markets in recent history. When families are struggling to sell their homes, as housing prices plunge Sen. Bob Menendez voted to take even more money from families struggling to sell their homes,"" the Sept. 4 blog post says.The post includes a chart that lists how much this new tax would cost homeowners. Sell your home for $200,000? The chart claims you would pay $7,600 in taxes.Sell your home for $500,000? That’ll cost you $19,000 in taxes, according to the chart.But that’s simply false.Menendez Facts acknowledged in an e-mail that we were fact-checking this claim and said they would update their blog post this week, but did not say how.Versions of this home sales tax claim have been checked by PolitiFact and other nonpartisan fact-checking groups several times before. The claim has been roundly declared as false and PolitiFact has rated it Pants on Fire.Such claims stem from a provision included in the 2010 national health care overhaul.On March 25, 2010, the Senate passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which was the second part of the health care bill.  Menendez, who is running for re-election in November, voted in favor of that bill, which included a new tax on investment income for wealthy individuals that goes into effect in 2013.The law created a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for individuals who have an adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 or couples with an adjusted gross income of more than $250,000. That investment income could include profits from real estate transactions.PolitiFact National noted in a similar fact-check in July, that those high-income earners represent less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. Individuals or couples who make less than those income thresholds would not be subject to the tax.But even if a couple earned more than those thresholds, the tax only applies to profits from the sale of a home, not the sales price itself, as the blog post claims.Also, if the home being sold is your primary residence, the first $250,000 in profits for an individual, or the first $500,000 in profits for a couple, is excluded from the tax.And for some perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported that the national median existing-home price in July was $187,300. No homeowner could make $250,000 in profit on the sale of that home and, therefore, would not pay the 3.8 percent tax.Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s campaign communications director, said in an e-mail, ""Senator Menendez worked on behalf of New Jersey’s middle class families, and all Americans, to help provide them access to quality, affordable health care by helping to make the Affordable Care Act the law of the land. It is sad that, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the law, some falsehoods about the law persist ­– evidently with the help of the MenendezFacts.com web site.""Our rulingA blog called Menendez Facts claimed that ""Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%.""That’s a distortion of the truth.Menendez voted in favor of a bill tied to the health care law that created a tax on investment income for high-income earners.Though that investment income could include profits from real estate transactions, it is not a tax on the sales price of a home and it would not impact the vast majority of Americans.Wealthy individuals who sell their home for a large profit may be subject to the tax, but the blog does not make that clear and suggests the tax applies to the sales price of homes, regardless of an individual’s income.So again we set this ridiculous claim ablaze: Pants on Fire!Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax.

A similar idea failed with voters two years ago.A coalition of critics calling itself the It's Still a Bad Idea committee called an inaugural press event on Monday to denounce what it calls a ""slick campaign"" by casino advocates to ""mislead voters,"" according to a press release. The campaign is funded largely by Oregon tribes, which operate their own casinos and could lose money to the private venture.At the event, campaign spokeswoman Cynara Lilly told reporters that The Grange, as it’s called, ""would be the largest casino in the United States.""Really? In little old Wood Village? That didn’t sound right. Maybe it would be the largest in Oregon, but we knew enough about mega-casinos to know that sounded overblown.First, we checked with Lilly, to make sure we had quoted her correctly. We had, but she wanted to make a clarification. ""I did mis-speak,"" she said to PolitiFact Oregon. ""Technically, this would not be the largest casino in the United States. It would be the second largest. It would be the largest in the West.""She specified not square footage, but the number of slot machines and gambling tables. That still sounded on the high side. The Grange proposes a 130,000 square-foot casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 gambling tables. That would top the number of video slot machines at Oregon’s largest tribal casino -- the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino-- but 2,200 is pretty much the norm for the big players in Las Vegas. So what gives?And here’s where we get to the fine print.The Grange developers have a business plan for a casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 card tables, but the language in Measure 83 would allow for up to 3,500 slot machines and 150 gaming tables. (Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for Grange developers, said they will build the proposed amount as that’s what the market will bear and they don’t anticipate that changing.)A 3,500-machine casino would be larger than the posh Bellagio in Las Vegas, which has more than 100,000 square feet with 2,400 slot machines. Or Mandalay Bay in Vegas, which has more than 2,000 slot machines.But it would pale next to the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, which has 6,000 slot machines, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tampa, Fla., which ""features more than 5,000 slot machines, 110 table games and 50 poker tables."" The WinStar World Casino in Oklahoma has 500,000 square feet of ""gaming floor"" with about 6,700 electronic games and 76 tables. You get the point.Many of these mega-casinos are in the midwest and in the east, so Lilly is on the rightish track when she tells PolitiFact Oregon that a Wood Village casino with 3,500 slot machines would be the largest casino on the West Coast. Certainly it would contain more than twice the floor size of Spirit Mountain Casino.Here’s the problem with that: (1) That’s not what she said at the press event, which was called to counter what they call a deceptive campaign waged by casino advocates, and (2) Grange developers aren’t building a casino with 3,500 video poker machines and 150 card tables.We know! Some of you are probably thinking, how could PolitiFact Oregon be so naive? How could we be so gullible? What’s to stop the private casino people from pitching a smaller casino, then building a larger one? Well, all we can say is that developers would still have to get local permits to build a casino with more slot machines and, according to one legal reading, legislators can change the statutory maximum.In any case, casino opponents are right to call out the larger numbers in the measure. Voters should have that information. But we can’t measure a proposed casino on the maximum number allowed when backers are selling a smaller number. PolitiFact Florida had the same issue in 2011 and fact checkers there went with the developer’s stated number when assessing a claim about a proposed 800,000 square-foot casino in Miami.We follow precedent and go with what the developers say, and we return to the statement.Campaigns bear a special responsibility when making statements for or against anything. They have to have their facts straight, and they have to know what they’re talking about. We understand that people sometimes slip, but campaign people can’t afford to do that. Especially when they have called a press conference to counter deceptive campaigning by the other side.Lilly said that the proposed casino in Wood Village would be the largest in the country, which is not only inaccurate, but downright ridiculous. Her revised statement that the proposed casino would be the second largest in the country isn’t even close to accurate either. That shows a reckless disregard for accuracy.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.Featured Fact-checkYes on 82 and 83 campaignstated on September 20, 2012 in a campaign adSays Measures 82 and 83 authorize just one more casino. By Janie Har • September 27, 2012","http://stillbadfororegon.org/,http://www.thegrangeoregon.com/,http://www.thegrangeoregon.com/sites/default/files/8.22.12%20Fact%20sheet%20one-pager%20-%20final_0.pdf,http://spiritmountain.com/casino,http://thegrangeoregon.com/sites/default/files/8.22.12%20Fact%20sheet%20one-pager%20-%20final_0.pdf,http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/038text.pdf,http://www.bellagio.com/press-room/press-releases.aspx,http://www.mandalaybay.com/casino/slots/,http://mohegansun.com/playing/gaming.html,http://www.seminolehardrocktampa.com/press/single-release/147,http://winstarworldcasino.com/about-us,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/17/no-casinos/no-casinos-group-says-genting-would-build-casino-d/,/personalities/yes-82-and-83-campaign/,/factchecks/2012/sep/27/yes-82-and-83-campaign/do-measures-82-and-83-authorize-just-one-new-casin/",,"Oregon,Gambling,It's Still a Bad Idea",,,,,

Former Democratic Ohio governor, Ted Strickland, made that connection when he appeared on Meet the Press last month.  Strickland said unemployment in Ohio was below the national average and his state had ""created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio.""We have examined the resurgence of the Ohio auto industry before. Republican Gov. John Kasich downplayed its impact on the state’s overall economy. We rated that Mostly True. Strickland is giving the auto bailout particular credit for growth in the manufacturing sector and that specific connection is one that we look into now.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Strickland has it right for the number of manufacturing jobs in Ohio. They went up by about 47,000 between the start of 2010 and the middle of 2012.Where he gets into trouble is proving that a large part of the job growth is due to the automotive sector. Jobs in building cars and making the parts that go into cars did go up, but only by a bit over 5,000, or 12 percent of the total increase. That’s not a small fraction, but it doesn’t seem to qualify as a ""large part.""We contacted Strickland’s colleagues at the Ohio Democratic Party for supporting details and they did not provide any.However, the direct job figures don’t tell the whole story. The supply chain that feeds into a finished car is long and complicated. The BLS tracks the car parts industry, but it doesn’t track the other manufacturing jobs that supply auto parts makers. An analysis by the Center for Automotive Research, an independent group that gets some support from the auto industry, found that the number of jobs in metals, plastics and rubber that are tied to auto parts makers is about half again larger than the number of jobs in the auto parts sector itself.It is very difficult to know how this ripple effect plays out in Ohio itself.""The problem is we have these artificial boundaries called state borders,"" said Kim Hill, associate research director at the Center.

And he added, the pattern would carry through for all primary metals, machine shops and other fabricators.The larger the fraction of steel, for example, that went to cars, the larger the number of jobs attributable to the industry. Some of those downstream companies could be selling to car makers and car part suppliers in other states. The revival of the car industry was not limited to Ohio. It also took hold in places such as Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Increased activity there could produce jobs in Ohio.As a final complication, Strickland tied the auto industry to manufacturing in general. At some level, when people have jobs, they buy some big ticket items such as washing machines and refrigerators. Those purchases also would generate manufacturing jobs.The problem is, we could find no clear tally of all of these possible effects.Based on the numbers we can find for manufacturing jobs that feed into the supply chain of auto parts, we might take the figure from the Center for Automotive Research and say that  those jobs might account for another 4,000 manufacturing workers in Ohio due to the auto industry.If one counted all of those jobs, that would still translate into only about 20 percent of the manufacturing jobs added in the state.Our RulingStrickland said that Ohio ""created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio.""Strickland is right on the big number. Giving major credit to the auto industry is a harder case to make. Based on the information gathered by the BLS, the automobile sector accounted for just one-eighth of the new manufacturing jobs.

John Thune, R-S.D.""The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life,"" Thune said during the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Aug. 29. ""Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!""Is it true that Obama’s administration proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores?We’ve heard similar claims about a proposed U.S. Department of Labor rule change about children working on farms. Members of Congress such as U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., said the proposed rule ""would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose.""Rooney was particularly concerned about regulations on power equipment. We ruled his statement Mostly False, though, in April 2012. The proposed rule didn’t specifically mention hoses or screwdrivers, and the Labor Department specifically said it had no intention of banning children from using such equipment.Thune introduced legislation in March 2012 to block the Labor Department from enacting the proposed restrictions.The Labor Department wrote that the goal was to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. The department was specifically concerned about actual cases of minors killed or maimed in incidents with equipment on farms. But the widespread criticism prompted the Labor Department to yank its proposal, which never went into effect.Parental exemptionThune mentioned ""family farms,"" which suggests Obama’s administration wanted to ban kids from doing chores even on their own parents’ farms. By saying ""chores"" rather than something such as ""paid work"" Thune seems to also be suggesting that this is work on their own parents’ farms.For decades, though, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss.The summary of the proposed rules stated they ""would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents.""As we wrote in a fact-check of a similar claim from U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., that meant no matter the government rules, if a parent who owns a farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it.That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: ""Preserving America's Family Farm Act."" If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the proposed rules wouldn’t have applied at all.The way the department interpreted that parental exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers who didn’t quite meet that strict definition. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow.But that still left a lot of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms. Children under 16 would have been banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would have faced fines, and the government could have stopped shipment on crops.Our rulingThune said that the Obama administration ""even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores.""There was a proposed rule, prompted by cases of children suffering injury or death while working with agricultural equipment.But the rule did not apply to kids working on their parents' farms.We should note there was controversy because some farmers felt that the Labor Department was interpreting the exemption too strictly. In the end, the whole proposed rule was tossed in the trash by federal officials after an outpouring of complaints.But while the proposal was alive, federal officials did not propose banning children from doing basic chores on their parents’ farms.It's ridiculously false to suggest it applied to children of family farmers and even sillier to say it applied to ""chores.""

Either plan would be a big change from the rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent in place for 2012 under current law.So let’s look at how millionaires would fare under Thompson’s own plan, then the Tommy-endorsed Ryan plan.Would Thompson’s plan cut taxes for millionaires?The overall answer is yes, though some may already be paying lower rates than 15 percent.In June, we rated Mostly True a Baldwin claim that Thompson's plan ""amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent"" based on IRS data. People with income over $1 million are part of that category.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021Thompson’s campaign did not dispute Baldwin’s 1 percent analysis, saying the tax cut for the wealthy was needed because the top 1 percent  pay 37 percent of all income taxes collected, while half of Americans don’t pay any federal taxes.Newt Gingrich, a Thompson backer, also proposed a 15 percent flat tax during the GOP presidential primaries, and it would have meant massive six-figure federal tax cuts for million-dollar earners, according to a study by the respected Tax Policy Center, an Urban Institute-Brookings Institution project that analyzes candidate’s tax proposals.Baldwin’s TV spot adds a specific claim: Thompson favors giving a ""new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires.""It cites the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, but that number originally came from the Tax Policy Center.The Tax Policy Center study did, as Baldwin notes, estimate that those earning at least a million dollars would receive an average tax cut of $265,000 under that plan. That scenario assumes the Bush-era tax cuts would be extended.We asked William McBride, chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, about the Tax Policy Center study and he offered no criticism of it.Overall Baldwin is on pretty firm ground regarding how the plans Thompson has endorsed would affect high income earners.The middle classNow let’s turn to Baldwin’s claim that Thompson wants to raise federal taxes on the middle class, to the tune of $1,300.Notably, Baldwin’s ad turns away from the Tax Policy Center report it relied upon regarding the Ryan plan’s effect on millionaires’ tax bills.One reason may be that the Tax Policy Center report showed that Ryan’s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over $30,000 a year -- not a tax hike for the middle class as Baldwin claims.Baldwin got the $1,300 increase from the report prepared by staff for U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania Democrat who chairs the US Congress Joint Economic Committee.That report said the net effect of the Thompson-endorsed Ryan plan would be a $1,358 increase for households earning between $50,000 and $100,000.The discrepancy stems from a huge difference in methodology between the Casey report and the Tax Policy Center analysis of Ryan’s plan.The Casey report assumes -- without really knowing -- that Ryan and fellow Republicans would eliminate current deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, remove the employer‐provided health insurance exclusion, and tax 401(k) contributions. The authors of the study explained that Ryan ""potentially"" would have to cut those tax breaks in order to achieve his goal of cost neutrality on his tax cuts.Losing those deductions has the effect of wiping out the tax cuts those middle-income people would see under Ryan’s plan to cut the tax rates, McBride said.But that approach amounts to relying on facts not in evidence -- and taking the worst-case approach to make the point.The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, attributed no elimination of deductions to Ryan’s plan, noting that his plan doesn’t specify what Republicans would do. (Ryan’s plan does strongly suggest that some tax breaks would go and others would remain, but specifics are lacking).That’s why that study shows the middle class still getting a tax cut.Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said Baldwin’s mixing of the two studies is a problem.""They are not even apples and oranges,"" Williams said. ""It’s more like apples and toast.""Both Williams and McBride expressed some concerns with the Democratic study because it assumes Ryan would eliminate major tax deductions that greatly benefit the middle class and below.""We had no basis to decide what Ryan would pick"" to eliminate, Williams said. He also criticized the Democratic study as using questionable estimates.McBride, though, said its undeniable that if Republicans end some major deductions while cutting the top tax rates, it would ""disproportionately benefit high income earners.""That’s all related to the Ryan plan.Thompson’s own plan talks of protecting -- not ending -- the deduction for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions. He does not rule out eliminating other deductions, though. In the absence of details, specific conclusions about how middle-income families would fare are difficult.Finally, Baldwin’s ad says Thompson is himself a millionaire.Thompson hasn’t disclosed tax returns, but his required financial disclosure statements show he reported $5.2 million in earned and noninvestment income between January 2010 and October 2011. That shows him to be in the million-dollar club during that period.Our ratingBaldwin charged that Thompson ""wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.""There is no real dispute that Thompson’s own plan and the Ryan plan he endorsed would yield a big tax cut, on average, for million-dollar earners. And the $265,000 figure is from calculations by a respected group.The impact is far less clear for the middle class. To establish a tax increase, the ad cites a report that assumes key, worst-case details about the Ryan plan and ignores that Thompson has specifically opposed scrapping some of the deductions.Baldwin’s ad draws a debatable conclusion about the middle class by splicing together two very different studies on the tax implications of the tax-rate cuts Thompson favors.We rate the claim Half True.","http://www.tammybaldwin.com/news/2012/tammy-baldwin-statement-on-the-general-election/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgKPv3nFiM,http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3728&emailView=1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqGr2q5qCV4&feature=plcp,http://budget.house.gov/fy2013prosperity/,http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/RESTORE_Tax_Reform.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/10/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-says-tommy-thompsons-tax-plan-would-/,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3247&DocTypeID=1,http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/,http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3384,http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3384,http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File_id=bc6c837c-cfbd-4212-a85f-9b88695dcb85",,"Message Machine 2012,Taxes,Wisconsin,Tammy Baldwin",,,,,

Peter Petrarca ""voted on two pieces of legislation that helped auto body shops ... and at that point I think there is a conflict of interest.""",,politifact,,"One of the issues that sparked outrage around the State House in June was the last-minute lawmaking on behalf of the auto body shop industry.Around 3 a.m. on June 13, lawmakers approved a bill giving auto body shops the right to sue insurance companies if they couldn't agree on the cost of car repairs.The legislation was pushed by John Petrarca, president of Providence Auto Body, and his daughter, Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, spokeswoman for the Auto Body Association of  Rhode Island. They are the father and sister, respectively, of Rep. Peter J. Petrarca, D-Lincoln, who did not vote on the bill.But insurance company representatives said Representative Petrarca, the House senior deputy majority leader, had lobbied hard for the legislation.Governor Chafee  vetoed the bill days later, saying it would hurt consumers by generating lawsuits that ultimately would increase insurance premiums and interfere with customers' contracts with their insurance companies.But Petrarca's challenger in the House District 44 Democratic primary, Gregory J. Costantino, sought to keep Petrarca in the cross hairs of criticism when the two men appeared on ""Newsmakers"" on Channel 12 (WPRI) on Aug. 12.Costantino said that while Petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation, he had voted on auto shop bills in the past, which Costantino described as a clear conflict of interest. As an example, Costantino referred vaguely to a bill in 2003 and another one in 2010. He gave no specifics about either piece of legislation.In response, Petrarca said: ""I don't know what they do. I don't know what they are."" And then he launched into an unrelated line of incriminations against Costantino.We were curious what legislation Costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that Petrarca - whose law firm represents Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of  Rhode Island - had indeed voted for them.In a telephone interview, Costantino identified the two bills in question, amended pieces of legislation that had passed between the House and Senate: 2003 Senate bill 0022 and 2010 Senate bill 2508.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021The 2003 bill specifies standards for when ""aftermarket"" parts - those that come from a company other than the car manufacturer - can be used in repairs. For instance, it states that if an insurance company orders an auto body shop to use an aftermarket part, the insurance company is responsible for any cost a shop incurs trying to fit that part into place. It also requires the shop to notify the appraiser if the aftermarket part does not restore the car to its original condition.The 2010 bill would make it an unfair claims practice if an insurance company failed to use an independent appraiser -unaffiliated with the repair shop - when vehicle damage exceeded $2,500.We called the State House Library to check the House Journal for the votes of those two bills.The records do indeed show Petrarca voting on both occasions - each time in favor of the bills, which passed.When we called Petrarca, he said he still didn't know what bills his opponent had been talking about, and so we brought him up to speed with what we learned.He was unapologetic.""Those two bills, those pieces of legislation, do not benefit body shops,"" he said. ""They benefit the consumer."" With the 2003 bill, he said, ""If the shop can prove that the aftermarket part doesn't fit, they [insurance company] have to pay for a new part.""There is no conflict [of interest] because it doesn't affect body shops. He [Costantino] should get his facts right.""Our rulingGregory Costantino said during a recent ""Newsmakers"" broadcast that Rep. Peter Petrarca had in the past voted for two pieces of auto body shop legislation and therefore his actions amounted to a conflict of interest.The official legislative record shows Petrarca voted on the bills. And considering Petrarca's professional and personal connections to the auto body shop industry, his vote on them posed at least an appearance of conflict of interest. But whether the bills actually help body shops or consumers is debatable.Therefore we rate Costantino's claim: Mostly True.","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Rhode Island,Economy,Ethics,Gregory J.

441,,,,true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/15/stephanie-cutter/ryans-plan-includes-700-billion-medicare-cuts-says/,Says Paul Ryan's budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about.,,politifact,,"Mitt Romney’s pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.Ryan’s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!For this check, we’re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.""You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,"" Cutter said. ""You know what those cuts are? It’s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.""It’s a lot to digest if you’re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them ""cuts"" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.$700 billion in Medicare cuts?Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget.Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.So it’s timing that’s making the ""cuts"" bigger, not changes to Medicare. Does the Ryan budget ‘protect those cuts’?Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney’s running mate:Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" (Read the full exchange.)So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.That’s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.Our rulingCutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney’s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.","http://www.people-press.org/2011/06/06/opposition-to-ryan-medicare-plan-from-older-attentive-americans/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-first-history-rob-me/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/16/mitt-romney/500-billion-medicare-obamacare-romney-says/,https://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf,https://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-vicki-kennedy-jack-lew-paul-ryan/story?id=16673650&page=7#.UCqcqqCiH9o,http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/13/13266514-romney-struggles-to-get-square-with-ryans-medicare-plan?lite,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"National,Federal Budget,Health Care,Medicare,Retirement,Stephanie Cutter",,,,,

Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., for the state’s 4th Congressional District in 2010. The two men are in a rematch this fall.DeFazio’s campaign recently issued a press release, accusing the chemist from Cave Junction of trying to moderate what DeFazio considers extremist views on public schools, nuclear waste and Social Security.""Despite his attempt to recast himself as Social Security’s great defender in 2012, Art Robinson has repeatedly called Social Security a ‘Ponzi Scheme’ including as recently as December 2011,"" states the DeFazio release. ""And he has said in speeches and interviews that programs like Social Security and Medicare should be ended by attrition.""The press release accompanies an online ad that likens Robinson to Mr. Rogers, but not in a kindly, cardigan-sporting way. ""It’s a nutty day in his neighborhood,"" the voiceover sings as the camera hovers over a diorama of streets and houses.""And here he said Social Security should be ended through attrition,"" the voiceover continues. These phrases show up on screen: ""These entitlement programs need to be ended …"" and ""... they have to be ended by attrition."" Robinson is heard speaking these words in the ad. The words ""Social Security Ended"" appear on screen later in the ad.So what gives? Does Robinson want to end Social Security? By attrition? Is he backpedaling? Does he want to freak out frail senior citizens? We’re only sort of kidding on that last question because that’s what the DeFazio campaign is saying with its press release and ad.Most people know Social Security as the federal program that workers and their employers pay into over the course of the employee’s work life; the person then gets monthly stipends based on age of retirement and pay. The program also pays for people with disabilities and survivors of retirees. (Both Social Security and Medicare face long-term financial challenges and lawmakers have been urged to fix problems with both programs so there will be enough money for future recipients.)Robinson, not surprisingly, argues that DeFazio is wrong to say -- and to say only -- that he would end programs such as Social Security.  ""I have consistently called for increases in Social Security payments,"" Robinson writes in his new book, ""Common Sense in 2012.""""I have pointed out that Social Security payments have lagged badly behind price increases. They must be increased to catch up. The federal budget must be balanced, but not by short-changing seniors for benefits they have paid for and counted on.""He sounds very senior-friendly there. DeFazio’s people contend this is a prime example of Robinson backtracking from previous statements -- to end Social Security -- that were not as senior-friendly.Let’s take a breath and go back to the original interview on which the web ad is based in part. Luckily we didn’t have to hunt too long because it’s posted on the ""Who is Art Robinson?"" website paid for by DeFazio. In the nearly 90-second long clip, Robinson says that we need to change the Social Security system because we’re digging ourselves into a hole:""We should change our ways so that we don't incur any further liabilities under entitlements. In other words, these entitlement programs need to be ended, but they can’t be ended by violating the contracts of the people who have already contracted with the government, they have to be ended by attrition. You have to stop taking on new people in the entitlements and let time pass and gradually by attrition cancel them.""Even here, you can see that Robinson cares about the contract that government has with Social Security recipients; in other words, he doesn’t want to abandon them. Workers, after all, have paid into the system. A review of previous campaign statements shows that Robinson has consistently called for increasing payments to recipients and making sure the contract with recipients is honored.In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Robinson stood by the totality of his position on Social Security and said he hasn’t changed his views. He said he wrote what he did in his book because he was tired of DeFazio picking on only one part of his views -- the part most likely to alarm seniors. PolitiFact Oregon can sympathize, although the 2012 book is pretty heavy on wanting to save seniors and doesn’t mention the word attrition once.We’re not going to rule on whether ending Social Security by attrition is feasible or flawed. We’re not going to rule on whether Robinson is trying to have it both ways, by calling for an end to the current system while increasing payments to current recipients. Those are issues for voters.We will rule on the accuracy of DeFazio’s claim that Robinson wants to end Social Security ""by attrition."" Robinson has called for an end by attrition and continues to say we should end the current program by attrition, to be replaced by another system, whether it’s private or mixed with a public program.But we think it’s also important to point out that Robinson has consistently called upon the government to honor its obligations to Social Security recipients. We rate DeFazio’s statement Mostly True: Accurate but needs additional information.Featured Fact-checkKurt Schraderstated on September 11, 2010 in a debate at the Salem City ClubSays Scott Bruun ""still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security.""By Charles Pope • October 2, 2010","https://www.ssa.gov/,https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/index.html,http://www.artforcongress.com/sites/default/files/common-sense-2012-6-18.pdf,http://www.artforcongress.com/sites/default/files/common-sense-2012-6-18.pdf,http://whoisartrobinson.defazioforcongress.org/category/social-security/,http://whoisartrobinson.defazioforcongress.org/,/personalities/kurt-schrader/,/factchecks/2010/oct/02/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-scott-bruun-wants-privatize-soc/",,"Oregon,Social Security,Peter DeFazio",,,,,

Reid said, ""His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,"" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s.Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, ""Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.""Reid continued, ""He didn't pay taxes for 10 years!

Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.""On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, ""As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns.

So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years.

Romney added, ""Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong.

The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an ""unbecoming, corrosive game."" ""Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,"" Bruni wrote. ""Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.""Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true.An anonymous source?On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation.Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years.In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries.But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million.To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent.Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years.Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, ""probably not.""The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s ""highly unlikely"" that he paid nothing.""It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold,"" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, ""But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.""Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also ""preposterous.""""Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,"" the article said. ""But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.""We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. ""I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,"" White said.Our rulingReid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that ""the word is out"" when in fact it was only Reid who put that ""word"" out.Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years.Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up.

Six days later, Dewhurst similarly referred to such signs in the pair’s last debate before the July 31, 2012, primary runoff.Border signs in English and Spanish, sure. But Chinese?Dewhurst’s camp did not respond to our inquiry about this.But Daniel Milian, a Border Patrol supervisor in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector, told us such signs are posted next to ""rescue beacon"" towers arrayed in the rough brush country that covers much of the Texas-Mexico border region. In a telephone interview, Milian said the towers, 40- to 50-feet tall, are visible from great distances, the idea being that border crossers in danger of falling ill or dying spot them and come close. He said the signs instruct individuals to press a button to summon authorities.And, Milian said, the signs are in English, Spanish and Mandarin, which is the group of dialects most widely spoken in China. The point, Milian said, is to deliver the message in ways that border crossers can understand. He said Mandarin was chosen because immigrants from China are second to immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries among border-crossers apprehended by the Border Patrol.How exactly did this transpire? In a March 3, 2009, Border Patrol press release, the Rio Grande Valley sector said it was deploying two beacons in preparation for summer heat and to ""reduce the possibility of heat-related injuries and death."" The release says the beacons were ""designed for deployment to remote areas along the border and to provide people, who perceive themselves to be in a life-threatening situation, with a mechanism for summoning assistance.""""The beacons will be embedded in established illegal alien and smuggling routes and are designed to provide a means by which persons in distress may locate, activate and summon emergency assistance,"" the 2009 release says. The release quotes Ronald Citiello, chief patrol agent in Falfurrias, as saying: ""We work very hard to ensure that our borders are secure and safe, but many lives are still lost as a result of people not fully comprehending the inherent dangers of illegally crossing through the remote areas and not being aware of how quickly heat related distress can occur.More recently, an April 27, 2012, Border Patrol press release stating that Border Patrol agents at the agency’s Falfurrias station, which is in Brooks County, saved the lives of two illegal immigrants that day after the pair activated a beacon. The release says the Border Patrol has six rescue beacons ""strategically placed on ranches throughout the area  Since Oct. 1, 2011, the release says, Border Patrol agents in the region had ""saved the lives of more than 120"" illegal immigrants, ""whose lives were in jeopardy due to a variety of circumstances.Nationally, Border Patrol officers apprehended about 340,000 illegal residents through the latest federal fiscal year, from October 2010 through September 2011, the agency says, including nearly 126,000 along or near the Texas-Mexico border.We failed to determine how many of the apprehended individuals were Chinese. But a July 2011 ""fact sheet"" from the Department of Homeland Security states that nationally, immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries comprised more than 95 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions over the five fiscal years through September 2010 with immigrants from China accounting for 0.3 percent or fewer of each year’s apprehensions.

U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell said he learned in his recent primary fight that the economy is at the forefront of people’s minds.So while explaining the need to set aside distractions and reach a balanced approach to deal with national fiscal issues, the Democratic congressman tried to set straight President Barack Obama’s record on taxes.""We need tax cuts, there’s no question about it,"" Pascrell said in a July 18 interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. But, he said, ""this president has not raised taxes. He has not raised taxes ... and I haven't agreed with the president on everything, even as a Democrat, but he has not raised taxes. There have been so many myths about this presidency and they need to be clarified and maybe we'll do that during the election.""Has Obama really not raised taxes?Thomas Pietrykoski, Pascrell’s spokesman, said the congressman was ""referring to the overall effective tax rate for American families."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact National found last year that for the average middle-class family, the effective tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer pays as a percentage of his income -- fell between 2008 and 2011.But Pascrell didn’t make that distinction in the interview. And Obama has raised some taxes.Obama earned a False last year from PolitiFact National for saying he ""didn’t raise taxes once.""Soon after taking office the president signed a bill that increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products. That tax hike went into effect in 2009.Then Obama signed the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but often called ObamaCare. That law includes several tax increases, some of which have not yet gone into effect, though some are in place now.For example, individuals who use indoor tanning services started paying a 10 percent tax in 2010.Other taxes in the law -- such as additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent on individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 -- don’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2013 or later.And then there’s the individual mandate, a linchpin of the health care law that will require people who forego health insurance coverage to pay a fine. The U.S. Supreme Court said in a decision upholding most of the law that the mandate ""may reasonably be characterized as a tax"" and that ""it is reasonable to construe"" it as a tax.Though these tax hikes may be relatively narrow in scope, they are examples of taxes increasing under Obama.But Obama has also cut taxes.The president said in 2011 that he ""lowered taxes over the last two years."" That statement earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National.The president’s stimulus bill included the ""Making Work Pay"" tax credit, which was intended to offset payroll taxes. The credit gave up to $400 for working individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010.Also, Obama and Congress reached a deal in 2010 to lower payroll taxes by 2 percent for one year. The reduced tax rate was later extended through the end of this year.The tax cuts impacted a broader group, while the tax increases have had a more narrow reach.Nevertheless, some taxes have still increased under Obama.Our rulingPascrell said ""this president has not raised taxes.""Some taxes have increased during Obama’s time in the White House. In his first months in office, Obama increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products and the national health care law includes a number of tax increases.It’s also true that other taxes -- such as payroll taxes -- have been reduced during the president’s tenure.However, it’s wrong to broadly state that Obama has not raised taxes.We rate this claim False.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax.

Separately, the State of Texas, led by its attorney general, Greg Abbott, has sued the government toward winning judicial approval of the law, which the Republican-led Legislature approved in 2011.Holder credited the NAACP with ""working to raise awareness about the potential impact of this and other similar laws, and the fact that – according to some recent studies – nationally, only 8 percent of white voting-age citizens, while 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens, lack a government-issued photo ID. In our efforts to protect voting rights and to prevent voting fraud, we will be vigilant and strong. But let me be clear: We will not allow political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right.""We asked the Justice Department how Holder reached his percentages and didn’t immediately hear back.But the references to 8 percent and 25 percent, respectively, were familiar to us.In a January 2012 fact check, we rated Mostly True a claim by Democratic U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and John Lewis of Georgia that up to ""one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote"" under the conditions of state photo ID laws.At the time, we noted that the figure originated in a 2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law.   The center combines research and legal advocacy on public policy issues such as campaign finance reform and racial balance in criminal law, and it has said that state efforts to require photo IDs from voters at the polls could discourage millions from voting, especially minority and low-income Americans. In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states’ voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs.   Two of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina’s law in December 2011 (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs) and declined to bless the Texas law in March 2012.The Texas law would require voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.   Back to the nationwide data: The center’s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, ""Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver’s license or a military ID?""   As voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters. The Brennan Center’s response said in part, ""While it is true that citizens in those groups are more likely to vote in any given election, they are not the only citizens who have the right to vote.""   Overall, according to the survey, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said.   In a December 2011 report, the NAACP mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that factors in individuals not having IDs may include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) or a lack of the documents needed to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which also can cost money to obtain.       When we looked into the Democrats’ claim, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs. Two national surveys taken in 2008, however, checked on registered voters.     Before the 2008 presidential election, researchers from the University of Washington and other schools carried out a national telephone survey of 4,563 registered voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state.   Another survey, reaching 10,000 registered voters via phone and Internet after the 2008 election, included questions about driver’s license ownership by race. In an Aug. 30, 2011, blog post, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III said responses showed that 19 percent of black respondents and 3 percent of whites did not have a driver’s license. In his blog post, Stewart did not break out results for Hispanic respondents.   Among half a dozen other studies, ranging in scope from three counties to three states, several struck us as having limited applicability:   Featured Fact-checkCory Bookerstated on February 9, 2021 in a statement“There is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century.""By Miriam Valverde • February 22, 2021The NAACP report said a 2008 Pew Center study in Georgia showed 30 percent of African Americans said they voted absentee because they lacked a photo ID. However, this statistic reflects the responses of only 30 voters in three counties, and the Pew report warns against using it to draw conclusions.A 2005 Department of Justice summary of state data said that among registered voters who applied for Georgia driver’s licenses or state ID cards, African Americans had state ID at a ""slightly higher"" percentage than whites.A 2011 Associated Press analysis of South Carolina data showed the state’s photo ID law would fall harder on black populations in some areas and on whites in other areas.Two other surveys asked questions closest to matching the statement by Holder.   A 2007 survey of Indiana’s voting-age citizens found 26.6 percent of blacks and 13.6 percent of whites did not have a ""current"" government-issued or state university-issued photo ID.   A 2008 survey of registered voters in Indiana, Mississippi and Maryland found 3.8 percent of blacks and 0.9 percent of whites did not have government-issued photo IDs.   Our ruling   Holder’s figures appear to trace to a single national survey taken about six years ago though, far as we can tell, mostly unchallenged since.Other collections of data do not touch on exactly the same points, but most indicate that African Americans are less likely than whites to hold varied kinds of government-issued IDs, with percentages of blacks without such IDs ranging from nearly 4 percent to more than 26 percent and percentages of whites having such an ID ranging from 1 percent to nearly 14 percent.   We rate Holder’s claim as Mostly True.","https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2012/ag-speech-120710.html,https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/jan/13/steny-hoyer/democratic-leaders-say-quarter-african-americans-d/,https://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/voting_law_changes_in_2012/,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/23/sc-voter-id-law-rejected-by-justice-department-130291671/,http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2012/03/12/doj_rejects_texass_voter_id_la.html,http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/08/without-proof-the-unpersuasive-case-against-voter-identification,https://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/citizens_without_proof_stands_strong/,http://www.naacp.org/pages/defending-democracy,https://latinodecisions.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/the-disproportionate-impact-of-stringent-voter-id-laws/,http://www.vote.caltech.edu/drupal/files/report/Final%20report20090218.pdf,http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/?p=4185,/personalities/cory-booker/,/factchecks/2021/feb/22/cory-booker/sen-cory-booker-right-about-legacy-usda-bias-again/,http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewcenteronthestatesorg/Initiatives/MVW/GA_voters.pdf?n=2979,https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/misc/ga_id_bond_ltr.php,http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/SC-voter-ID-law-hits-some-black-precincts-harder-2225488.php#ixzz1ijgFPFTv,https://depts.washington.edu/uwiser/documents/Indiana_voter.pdf,https://www.american.edu/spa/cdem/upload/csae080109.pdf",,"Civil Rights,Elections,Legal Issues,Texas,Eric Holder",,,,,

He said as governor he ""took on the DNR"" -- the Department of Natural Resources -- and also took control of appointing the agency’s leader. He blasted ""Agenda 21,"" the United Nations environmental program.And, with a touch of glee in his voice, he recounted how as governor he got rid of Kathleen Falk as a public intervenor, a position in the state Attorney General’s office that served as a sort of watchdog in environmental disputes.Falk, a Democrat appointed to the position by Attorney General Bronson La Follette, later was elected four times as Dane County executive. She lost races for governor in 2002, attorney general in 2006 and governor again in the 2012 recall primary.""Who had the guts to take away the public intervenor in this state?"" Thompson said at a meeting of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty.""I got rid of Kathleen Falk!"" he added, to big laughs in the crowd. ""I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk!""Did then-Governor Thompson eliminate the public intervenor’s office, getting ""rid"" of Falk and becoming the ""first to fire"" her?Let’s roll back the clock.The issue arose in 1995, when Thompson -- then in his third term as governor -- sought to eliminate the public intervenor’s office in his two-year budget.""It’s a law office hired by the state to sue us,"" Thompson complained at the time. He considered the intervenors ""state-financed lawyers for the environmental movement.""Proponents said the office saved the state money by solving problems and heading off lawsuits by environmental groups.The office was created in 1969 by Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican, as an independent mediator to represent the public's interest in court and state agency decisions.The intervenors were assistant attorneys who often sued other state agencies to register objections to plans for highway, dredging and mining projects.When Thompson made his move, two assistant attorneys general -- Falk and Thomas Dawson -- had full-time intervenor status. Both had served as intervenors under both Republican and Democratic attorneys general.In his budget bill, Thompson proposed doing away with the intervenor’s office by wiping out the attorney general’s authority to appoint intervenors.Although Republicans both chambers of the Legislature, the Senate passed a compromise abolishing one intervenor, and moving the other to the Thompson-controlled DNR with no power to sue.Two years later, the Legislature and Thompson eliminated the DNR position, with Democrats saying it had little authority.So Thompson can take credit for abolishing the office, which directly led to Falk losing the intervenor job.But does that mean Thompson fired her?Both Falk and Dawson stayed on as assistant attorneys general, just doing different assignments. Both positions were under the civil service system, so they could not lose their job by the stroke of Thompson’s pen.Falk stayed in the office for about two years until she left in 1997 to become Dane County executive. Dawson is a staff attorney in the office. Though Falk and others campaigned in subsequent years for restoring the intervenor’s office, it was never brought back.Thompson, of course, said he was the ""first"" to fire Falk.His campaign said he meant that statewide voters had later rejected her. That rings hollow because she never lost a campaign while holding an office. How can you be ""fired"" from a job you don’t have?Our ratingThompson said he was the ""first to fire"" Falk by eliminating the environmental watchdog known as the state public intervenor’s office.In making the remark, he did so in the context of abolishing the office, so he’s on target there.In a colloquial sense, ""fired"" may fit because Thompson knew Falk would no longer be intervenor due to his actions. But he went too far in leaving the impression Falk was out on the street. And Falk was never removed from any other job we know of, so Thompson misfired with ""first to fire.""We rate the claim Half True.Featured Fact-checkScott Manleystated on January 31, 2021 in TV interview“Nobody’s health is at risk right now” from PFAS contamination, as long as they are receiving bottled drinking waterBy Laura Schulte • February 19, 2021","http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-still-working-to-win-over-conservative-voters-2h5sfrb-160081175.html,http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/,/personalities/scott-manley/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/scott-manley/no-bottled-water-doesnt-solve-all-problems-residen/",,"Environment,State Budget,Wisconsin,Tommy Thompson",,,,,

In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans.""If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance,"" Obama said. ""This law will only make it more secure and more affordable.""This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past.For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."" We found that overly optimistic given the bill’s details at the time, so we rated it Half True.Later, Obama spoke more specifically. In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, ""If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" We concluded that nothing in Obama’s proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. So we rated the claim True.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, it’s less accurate.First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.CBO’s estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employer’s plan, but we think it’s reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation.Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.   How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population ""switched"" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company.The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting.Our rulingObama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it. But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed.In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the law’s provisions. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.","https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/28/remarks-president-supreme-court-ruling-affordable-care-act,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-promises-you-can-keep-your-health-ins/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/health-insurance-through-work-stays-place-under-re/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-15-ACA_and_Insurance.pdf,http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412267-america-under-aca.pdf,http://www.lewin.com/%7E/media/lewin/site_sections/publications/lewingroupanalysis-patientprotectionandaffordablecareact2010.pdf,http://www.cms.gov/ActuarialStudies/Downloads/PPACA_2010-04-22.pdf,https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2012/RAND_TR1221.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/02/blake-farenthold/rep-blake-farenthold-says-health-care-law-will-for/,http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/",,"National,Health Care,Barack Obama",,,,,

One of them, involving the gap between pay for women and men, was offered up by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed a test vote in the House on June 5.""Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace,"" Cicilline said. ""It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market.""The 77-cent figure has been repeated a lot by politicians and news organizations. President Obama has cited it. We saw it in a Cicilline fundraising letter after the GOP blocked the paycheck bill.It was the subject of an NBC ""Meet The Press"" exchange in which liberal commentator Rachel Maddow quoted the figure and Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos said the statistic was misleading.""For example, men work an average of 44 hours a week. Women work 41 hours a week. Men go into professions like engineering, science and math that earn more. Women want more flexibility,"" Castellano said amid a lot of overtalk.If the wage difference were so great, said Castellano, ""every greedy businessman in America would hire only women, save 25 percent and be hugely profitable.""An issue of discriminationThe underlying issue here is discrimination and the question is whether the pay is truly different for men and women doing the same job.Because Cicilline said women earned only 77 cents for every dollar that men earned ""in the same position,"" we decided to focus on his statement.When we asked Cicilline's office about the congressman's comment, spokesman Richard Luchette sent us to the usual source: a 2011 Census report showing the 77-percent level of female earnings to male earnings from 1960 to 2010. The data, in Figure 12 of the report, apply to full-time, year-round workers more than 14 years old. (The 77-percent number has been increasingly slowly, up from 60 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.)But that's not a job-by-job comparison.Luchette said Cicilline's statement is accurate because when he referred to ""in the same position,"" the congressman meant ""to refer to men and women who were in the same position in the labor force [full-time, year-round employees].""We believe that when someone says they are paid less ""in the same position,"" most people would understand that to be a job-by-job comparison. That's the standard we will use in this fact check.There are different ways to measure gender differences and each has its drawbacks. For example, the census looked at annual salary, but that includes bonuses and other compensation that are more likely to boost the pay of people in higher-paying brackets. It also includes self-employed but fails to account for professions such as teaching, where the full-time jobs don't last for a full year.There are other -- and perhaps better -- ways to measure the gap. For example, among people with full-time jobs, men were more likely to work longer hours than women, which would make their annual income look larger than women's.If you look at weekly pay among full-time workers, women age 16 and older are paid 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2010, according to Table 1 of a July 2011 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you look at hourly pay for all workers (Table 9), women earned 86 cents for every dollar men earned that year.The amount rose to 95 cents if you looked at women who had never married, suggesting that marriage may be a factor. The rate was 97 cents among female college graduates, compared to male college graduates.Still, that's a gap.Perhaps the most revealing part of the report is Table 5, which looks at weekly earnings by the number of hours men and women work.Overall, women age 16 and older earned 75 cents in 2010 for every dollar men earned. But that hides some surprising numbers.If you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned $1.04 cents for every dollar men earned. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly $1.13 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar.By the jobBut that's still not the type of job-by-job comparison we believe Cicilline was talking about.The Bureau of Labor Statistics tried to do that, too. Table 2 of the report compared the weekly earnings for men and women -- all employed full time -- for 501 occupations.However, for nearly 8 out of 10 of those jobs, the analysts didn't have enough data on male workers or female workers to make a reliable comparison.Among the 111 categories for which a comparison was possible, women in 45 jobs were paid less than 80 cents on the dollar and women in 35 positions were paid 80 to 90 cents for every dollar paid to men doing same task.Only in 31 of the categories did women earn at least 90 cents for every dollar that the men earned. (Women were paid more in only four jobs. Pay rates for women were $1.05 for every dollar earned by men among people who worked as stock clerks and order fillers. The rates were $1.10 among female bill and account collectors, $1.12 for food preparation and serving workers, and $1.05 among social service counselors.)Even in professions where women have predominated, men made more, according to the report. Female elementary and middle school teachers earned 91 cents on the dollar compared to men. Female registered nurses made less than 87 cents.The Institute for Women's Policy Research has done a more-exhaustive evaluation of the database and concluded that women earned less in the most common, highest paying and lowest paying occupations. But, again, the data are limited.Even those numbers may be overestimating the gap.Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor released the results of a study by CONSAD Research Corp. that it had commissioned because, according to the preface by Charles E. James Sr., a deputy assistant secretary, ""the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap.""Once adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward ""family friendly"" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits, the gap shrinks to between 93 cents and 95 cents on the dollar, the report said.""The raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action,"" said James. ""Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.""The report was released in January, 2009. Obviously, that hasn't stopped the debate.Our rulingDavid Cicilline said women ""earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position.""His spokesman said that was only a comparison among full-time, year-round workers. But we believe the average person would read his statement as a comparison of male and female workers in the same job, an indication that wage discrimination exists.But the source of that 77-cent figure is not based on a job-by-job assessment. It's an across-the-workforce number that fails to take into a host of factors that could skew the amount.All the data we examined showed pay gaps for women from as low as 58 cents to as high as $1.12 for every dollar earned by men.  And when you look at weekly earnings among wage and salary workers who work less than 40 hours a week, women earn more than men.In citing the 77-cent figure, Cicilline ignores conflicting estimates suggesting that the gender gap is narrower or, perhaps, nonexistent when lifestyle choices are taken into account. He also skirts a key problem: for most occupations, there is not enough good data to make the kind of comparison he is talking about.In other words, his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: our definition of Mostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Rick Perry said the country erred in 2008 by electing the wrong person as president.""Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels,"" Perry said June 7, 2012. ""Admit it, America -- 2008 was our national ‘oops’  moment!""We recently confirmed Obama had played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president. And PolitiFact reporters have previously explored claims about the debt, the success of the stimulus package and whether the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act amounts to socialized health care.Perry’s claim that Obama ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels"" struck us as novel. Is it correct?Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the botched federal gun trafficking investigation on the U.S.-Mexico border known as Fast and Furious in which federal agents lost track of hundreds of firearms they were letting flow into Mexico from Arizona as part of an effort to build cases against Mexican drug cartels.The multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation took place from late 2009 to early 2011 -- during Obama’s presidency -- under the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department.In the operation, agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased and circulated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Los Angeles Times said in a Dec. 8, 2011, news story. Two of the weapons turned up after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed in southern Arizona, the paper said, though for a January 2012 fact check, we found no information supporting a claim that ballistics tests confirmed that the found weapons killed the agent.The Times said scores of other guns in the operation were reportedly used in violent crimes in Mexico, adding: ""While the aim of Fast and Furious was to track weapons, instead it ended up significantly arming the Mexican drug cartels.""And did Obama have a hand in the endeavor? We looked for indications.In a March 22, 2011, interview with Univision, posted online by CBS News, Obama said neither he nor Attorney General Eric Holder authorized Fast and Furious and pointed out that the operation was under internal investigation. ""We don’t have all the facts,"" Obama said.Asked if he was informed about the operation, Obama replied: ""Absolutely not. This is a pretty big government, the United States government. I’ve got a lot of moving parts."" He added: ""Our policy is to ramp up the interdiction"" or capture ""of guns flowing south, because that’s contributing to some of the security problems that are taking place in Mexico.""In an interview the same day with CNN Español and an October 2011 interview with ABC News, Obama said he learned of Fast and Furious from news reports. He further said to CNN: ""We have to make sure that we are interdicting the flow of guns and cash to the south. It's not enough just to interdict drugs flowing north. And so, we've actually initiated a whole range of measures to make sure that we're reducing that southbound flow.""Noting that Holder had launched the internal investigation into Fast and Furious, Obama told ABC ""it is not acceptable for us to allow guns to go into Mexico... So it's very upsetting to me to think that somebody showed such bad judgment that they would allow something like that to happen and we will find out who and what happened in this situation and make sure it gets corrected.""We looked for other signs of Obama’s role in the operation, finding nothing to contradict his accounts.In 2011, staff to the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, issued two Fast and Furious reports. The June 14, 2011, report covers Fast and Furious accounts of ATF agents. The July 26, 2011, report explores the impact of Fast and Furious on Mexico. The reports do not gauge Obama’s involvement.A January 2012 report by House Democrats says the strategy of permitting illegal guns to flow to cartels in Mexico in hopes of building cases against vital figures originated with federal law officers in Arizona in 2006, which was when George W. Bush was president.""Unfortunately, this strategy failed to include sufficient operational controls to stop these dangerous weapons from getting into the hands of violent criminals, creating a danger to public safety on both sides of the border,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told colleagues in a Jan. 30, 2012, letter summarizing the report. His letter says Fast and Furious was the fourth federal operation since 2006 in which gun-walking occurred.Finally, we reached the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has been critical of Fast and Furious. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber provided a partially redacted document that appears to be a Jan. 8, 2010, briefing paper on Fast and Furious originated by federal authorities based in Arizona.

John Kasich share a common desire: they both think they can lay claim to Ohio’s gradually improving economic condition. But on this issue Kasich isn’t much in the sharing mood.Obama, a Democrat, is seeking re-election and likely will need to win Ohio in November to return to the White House. Kasich, a Republican, is backing GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.Obama’s surrogates credit  the president’s orchestrating of the automobile industry bailout in 2009 with helping to retain tens-of-thousands of Ohio jobs. But Kasich recently downplayed the role the $24.9 billion government boost for General Motors and Chrysler has played in Ohio to this point.During an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Kasich was asked why he wasn’t giving Obama’s bailout of the industry more credit for the job growth in Ohio.""Giving the facts: 73,000 jobs created ... since '11,"" he responded to host David Gregory. ""Do you know how many direct jobs in the auto industry?  1,800.""Kasich praised the resurgent strength of the auto industry in Ohio, but his intent was clear: diminish the role that job sector has had in Ohio under his administration by declaring that less than 2.5 percent of all jobs created here in the last 17 months were jobs in automobile manufacturing.He followed up by noting that the biggest areas of job growth are in business and financial services and medical fields. ""See, what we have done in Ohio is we've diversified the economy so that we have multiple ways to grow jobs,"" he said.The auto industry is important to Ohio. The Center for Automotive Research ranks the state No. 2 for auto industry workers. So PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the governor’s claim.To PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And the governor chose his words for this claim very carefully. Two key words in his statement are ""created"" (as opposed to ""created or retained""), and ""direct"" as in jobs directly tied to making vehicles. That second distinction would exclude indirect jobs, such as those at  restaurants and other businesses that benefit because of nearby automobile plants.This is an important distinction because Democrats regularly cite figures from a Center for Automotive Research report that claims in 2010 Ohio had just over 848,000 jobs tied to the automobile industry, of which about 150,000 are characterized as direct jobs. Many of those were jobs that were retained thanks to the automobile bailout even though Ohio, like other auto industry states, lost thousand of jobs in 2008 and 2009 which precipitated the bailout.Democrats have hailed the president for saving the industry and framed the conversation in terms of jobs saved and gradually returning. But Kasich was more restrictive in his phrasing, speaking only of direct jobs created. (That’s a departure from his the phrase ""created and retained"" that he often uses when talking about jobs in Ohio.)PolitiFact Ohio checked with Kasich’s staff about his claim.  They cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS counts motor vehicle manufacturing, motor vehicle parts manufacturing, and motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing as direct jobs, according to BLS economist Parker Harvey.The BLS data shows Kasich’s stat was high. Between January 2011 and April 2012, Ohio had a net increase of 900 vehicle manufacturing jobs and net decrease of 200 parts manufacturing jobs for a total of 700 direct jobs. Also, through the third-quarter of 2011, the most recent figures available, Ohio was up about 400 body and trailer manufacturing jobs, according to BLS statistics. Add those together and you are still below 1,800.But the timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself. In talking about Ohio jobs created by the auto bailout the governor only used job figures that covered his time in office. Kasich took office in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama.Take any monthly snapshot you want in 2009 and compare it to when Kasich took office and you will see a significant net gain in vehicle manufacturing jobs. For example, in June 2009 Ohio had dropped to just 14,200 vehicle manufacturing jobs, down from 23,800 jobs just one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office that number had climbed back up to 19,200. That 5,000-job increase occurred after the auto bailouts, but isn’t reflected in the governor’s tally.And keep in mind, more jobs are coming to Ohio as the Chrysler and General Motors continued to rebound with the help of the bailout money. Chrysler is expected to add 1,100 more jobs by late summer or early fall to a plant in Toledo and GM recently announced that 100 temporary jobs at its plant in Lordstown will soon become permanent, full-time positions.Kasich’s claim is accurate. We’ll overlook that his 1,800 jobs figure is high since the BLS tally ultimately supports his point -- that job creation in Ohio’s economy is more diverse than just auto industry.But there’s additional information needed for clarification. By limiting the job creation numbers to just the time he has been in office, Kasich’s claim undersells the overall job growth that has occurred since the federal government rescued the auto industry.And his claim limited his figures to ""direct"" jobs that were ""created."" That does not reflect benefits to other businesses as a result of resurgence of auto employment or consider jobs that may have been retained.On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates Mostly True. Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Ohio,Economy,Jobs,John Kasich",,,,,

The latest episode involves one that was far-fetched even by birther standards.""Please research this info claiming to be about the governor of Hawaii faking Obama’s birth certificate,"" the reader asked, explaining that it came from his brother-in-law. We also found the account posted on a few birther blogs, where it prompted comments like ""the MSM will never touch this story, or investigate it. Send it to Sheriff Joe, maybe he'll do something with it."" (That's a reference to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who has rekindled birther theories.)The publisher of the original satire also got calls from people who believed it, as you'll see below.The email says:""New evidence now points a finger at Hawaii’s Governor Neil Abercrombie as the possible source of the widely disputed document purporting to be President Obama’s long form birth certificate. Surveillance photos of the South St. & Queen St. intersection routinely monitored by the Honolulu Fire Department have been leaked to the media. One frame clearly shows Governor Abercrombie leaving the Kinko’s late at night, on April 25th, two days before Obama unveiled the 'official' document.""The night manager at Kinko’s, Mr. Marvin Ishikawa, further corroborated what was shown on the video.""‘Sure I remember them,’ said Ishikawa. ‘They hogged my best graphics machine for hours. I thought the short guy looked a lot like the governor, but he said his name was John Smith. I thought it was kind of funny that they paid with a State of Hawaii government debit card.’ Ishikawa elaborated, ‘They were on that machine for almost two days straight, and I have the computer logs right here; 12 hours of Adobe Illustrator, 23 scans, a bunch of PhotoShop and several faxes back and forth to Washington, DC.’""Asked to identify the man in the video, Ishikawa said, ‘Yeah, that’s him, that’s ""Smith."" ‘""When Abercrombie first took office, he vowed to clear this birth certificate business up, once and for all, but by January of 2011 had given up. He basically told his friends that he simply ‘couldn’t find the dam thing.’ Things changed in April, when the President sent a letter to Hawaii’s Department of Health requesting a copy of the long form birth certificate.""According to one un-named source inside the DOH, everybody, including the Governor’s Office, panicked, ‘We had to do what we had to do.’ ""The text was accompanied by a green-tinted ""surveillance"" photo of a smiling Abercrombie holding the ""fake"" birth certificate outside the copy store in question. (Incidentally, Kinko’s changed its name to FedEx Office in 2008.)The photo looked fake to us, and it wasn’t hard to debunk the text as well. We found that it originated on the website of the Hawaii Reporter, a news and commentary blog that has won investigative journalism awards and is perceived as somewhat right-of-center.Whoever started this e-mail on its Internet voyage snipped off a bit of relevant information at the bottom of the story: ""EDITOR'S NOTE: This report is in our satire section.""Malia Zimmerman, editor and co-founder of the Reporter, told us the item was written by Keith Rollman, a Hawaii political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans and whose cartoons and writing are sometimes published on the Reporter’s website. He uses the pseudonym Atomic Monkey.""We ran the piece on April Fools Day, in our comics section, and said in the story that it was satire,"" Zimmerman said. ""We did not expect people to take this seriously. But we still had people calling and emailing us demanding more information about the piece. We are still getting calls today. Most had a good sense of humor about it when we pointed out the April Fools Day note, but not everyone took it so well. We did get some nasty notes. Other than putting the very top in all-caps, ‘THIS IS AN APRIL FOOLS DAY JOKE,’ I am not sure what else we could have done to be more clear.""We've seen this phenomenon before.One of the most long-lived chain emails we’ve seen circulating claims that Obama once said, ""Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?"" That was originally published by Arizona-based satirist John Semmens. We gave it a Pants on Fire.We have debunked other chain emails based on satires by Semmens. One claimed that that in a hearing, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., suggested to Gen. David Petraeus that the Army ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."" Semmens’ work was also turned into chain emails claiming that Obama wants to redesign the American flag ""to better offer our enemies hope and love,"" and that he thinks the national anthem should be ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.""Another satirist who saw his work go viral is Matthew Avitabile, who blogs his spoofs at Jumping in Pools. One satirical Avitabile post claimed that Obama wrote a thesis at Columbia University in which he criticized ""plutocratic thugs"" and said the Constitution gave Americans ""the shackles of hypocrisy."" Another was that the Obama administration ""wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.""The Abercrombie spoof doesn’t appear to have gained as much traction on the Internet as some of these other satires. Maybe it was too outlandish. As one commenter to the blog ""Native and Natural Born Citizenship Explored"" put it, ""The governor, sneaking down to Kinko’s …. LOL …. gives me flashbacks to college, when I often had to go to Kinko’s after midnight. No governors then, no governors now.""Our rulingIt seems silly that we have to put these claims to the Truth-O-Meter, but given that the Hawaii Reporter received serious calls about it and that the chain email continues to circulate, we'll quickly set the meter on fire to shed a little light on the silliness.

Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list.""We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home,"" Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School.Is his claim on the money?Walker’s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent.This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget’s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy.In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker’s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop.To be sure, that doesn’t mean every homeowner’s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes.While Walker’s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down.The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property.The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration’s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau’s property tax program supervisor.So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix.But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000.

Anastasia Williams went before the House Judiciary Committee May 16 to propose that Rhode Island voters be asked to approve an amendment to the state Constitution that would give voting rights to non-citizens who are legal residents. She said the Ocean State wouldn't be the first to do so.""In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation,"" she told the committee.That statement surprised us. If non-citizens in Massachusetts were eligible to vote in state and local elections, we thought we would have heard about it.We decided to investigate.In her testimony, Williams said the intent of the proposal ""is to give every legal resident of the state of Rhode Island the opportunity to be properly represented"" when they are abiding by the law and paying taxes. She asserted that some elected officials won't help residents who aren't registered voters.(She reported that her Cuban mother was a legal resident who declined to seek citizenship out of fear of losing her ties to her country of origin.)Currently, only U.S. citizens can vote in federal, state and local elections in Rhode Island. Under the bill Williams supports, if voters amended the Constitution, legal permanent residents -- holders of the so-called ""green card"" -- would also be allowed to vote, after 30 days of residency.When we called Williams, she said the information came from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which aids in drafting and researching legislation.House spokesman Larry Berman said the legislative research department made a mistake in a memo to Williams, with the wording suggesting that the proposals had become law in those states. They had not.In the meantime, we spoke with Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Massachusetts secretary of state's office and Julie Sinclair, a lawyer with the elections division of the Alabama secretary of state's office. Both confirmed that only citizens can vote in their states and both said an amendment to the state Constitution would be required to change that.Berman said the research that Williams relied upon from the General Assembly staff had been based on two bills, H-3430 in Massachusetts and SB-256 in Alabama.We tracked them down.The Massachusetts bill never got out of committee and called for permanent resident voting only in the town of Brookline.The reference to the Alabama legislation, a broad immigration bill, is even less relevant. As introduced, it specifically said that only citizens should be allowed to vote, the opposite of how Williams represented it. It did not make any reference to giving voting rights to permanent legal residents. And when it passed the Senate, the reference to who should be allowed to vote had been removed.So not only did the two pieces of legislation not become law, neither sought to give green-card holders the right to vote in statewide elections.Our rulingRep. Anastasia Williams, advocating for her proposal to extend state and local voting rights to non-citizens who are permanent legal residents, told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, ""In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation.""Williams said, and House spokesman Larry Berman confirmed, that she was relying on information from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which should be a reliable source.In fact, the information Williams received was inaccurate. Neither state took such action.""At the time I made this statement, I relied on the inaccurate information that was provided to me,"" Williams said in a comment released Thursday. ""This statement was not made intentionally.""Said House Speaker Gordon Fox, ""It is unfortunate that Representative Williams was quoting inaccurate information provided to her by a staff person and I am addressing this issue internally."".One last thought: we were surprised that a veteran legislator wasn't suspicious about the claim, given that Massachusetts is a neighbor and Alabama is known for having one of the nation's harshest laws against illegal immigrants.We rate her statement False.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Grayson, who represented House District 8 until Dan Webster unseated him in 2010, is running for a new Orlando seat.The commercial is part of a broader campaign by the lobbying group targeting Democrats over their support of ""Obamacare,"" including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson.

Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?""PolitiFact Florida fact-checked the ad’s claim that a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional and found it Mostly True.For this story we’re focused on the ad’s first claim that Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.It’s familiar ground for us, with mixed rulings depending on the context. When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said ""as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare,"" we rated the statement Half True.When the chamber claimed ""20 million people could lose their current coverage"" -- and suggested that included seniors who rely on Medicare -- in its anti-Nelson ad, we rated it Pants on Fire!The claim in this commercial’s context is pretty straight-forward. We’ll explain.The 20-million figure is a projection from nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office. You should know CBO has also projected the law will lead to new coverage for about 30 million uninsured Americans.The real issue here is a shift in how some people will get their health insurance.The RNC previously directed us to a March 2012 study by the CBO  that aimed to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer.CBO’s best guess was that between 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed.   CBO supplemented its projection with four alternative scenarios. Among the scenarios: One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The others resulted in a decrease of 10 million, a decrease of 12 million, and -- here it is! -- a decline of 20 million. (Read this fact-check for more details about the CBO report.)Priebus was partially accurate in his op-ed, but this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered.   So Priebus -- and now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- has engaged in cherry-picking.There’s more context to consider. Not everyone who ""loses"" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to the CBO, some people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance ""exchanges"" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits.In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans; they are choosing to switch.   Plus, the 20 million figure does not account for the 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before but will get coverage after passage of the law because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.Our rulingThe U.S. Chamber said, ""Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage."" It's a claim that is oft-repeated and much exaggerated.The chamber employs a worst-case projection by a nonpartisan research agency.

Former Gov. Charlie Crist appointed LeMieux to serve out the term of Mel Martinez, who resigned. LeMieux served from September 2009 to January 2011.Mack and LeMieux are competing for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to go against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. (Mack is now a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Fort Myers.)Mack’s ad shows President Barack Obama, mixing the president’s remarks with narration about LeMieux.  It goes like this:Obama: ""Two Republican senators, Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux …  because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass.  ""Narrator: ""George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  ""Obama: ""Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux .. and because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass, and I want to thank them.  ""Narrator: ""George LeMieux: once a liberal, always a liberal.  "" (The ad closes with LeMieux huddling with Crist.)We’re going to take out the Mack campaign’s ""liberal"" adjectives and focus on the facts of the matter: Was LeMieux one of two Republicans who voted for Obama's jobs bill?The bill in question is the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010 (H.R. 5297), which Obama signed into law on Sept. 27, 2010.As the name suggests, the law was aimed at getting money to small businesses and stimulating the economy. The law made about $30 billion available to small business, primarily through the Small Business Administration and its lending program for community banks. The law also included $12 billion worth of tax breaks for small business, mostly by changing tax rules on business expenses.Opponents of the law said at the time that the lending program was similar to the Troubled Asset Relief Progam, or TARP. ""It had the mini-TARP in there, with no real help to small businesses, as far as I'm concerned,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Washington Post  in 2010.LeMieux and Voinovich were two Republican senators who voted with Democrats to move the bill through the Senate. The Mack campaign pointed us to these votes when we asked for evidence for their ad.LeMieux and Voinovich cited widespread unemployment in their respective states (Florida and Ohio) as reasons to support the bill.Back then, LeMieux answered questions about his support on MSNBC’s Morning Joe:""Well, there's not been much I could agree on with the Democrats in Congress, because most of it's been job-killing. But this bill that (Sen.) Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and I worked on together is actually going to help small businesses in Florida. You know, Joe, that we've got nearly 2 million in Florida. They're suffering, and this bill will cut taxes by $12 billion for small businesses and increase lending to your local community bank, so that they can give dollars to small businesses and put people back to work. Doesn't raise the deficit, doesn't raise the debt, doesn't raise taxes. It made a lot of sense to me.""LeMieux spokesman Anna Nix responded with similar comments when we asked her on May 15, 2012, about the attack ad.Our rulingMack’s ad puts a lot of spin on the basic facts when it says, ""George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  "" Certainly that ""liberal"" tag is what gives the ad its bite. Here, we’re simply checking whether LeMieux was one of two Republican senators who voted for a jobs bill supported by the president.

But concerns about HB 87 -- Georgia’s immigration law -- were too hot a topic not to mention, he said.A Morris News Service article about the rally attributed to him a claim that the legislation cost farmers $400 million last year.""I said, ‘close to $400 million,’ "" said Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO.Flemming said he got the number from an Oct. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which itself was based on a University of Georgia study commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association.It’s a pretty big number and raises a couple of questions: Is the number right and are the losses attributable to the new immigration bill?We tracked down report co-author John McKissick, a UGA distinguished professor of agriculture marketing emeritus, to explain the report.McKissick said he and co-author Sharon Kane surveyed 189 farmers representing nearly half the state’s acreage for seven fruit and vegetable crops about their labor troubles during last spring’s harvest. The crops -- including blueberries, onions and watermelons -- were chosen because they are ""most dependent on timely seasonal harvest.""The results showed an acute labor shortage cost those farmers just under $75 million.Since the sample size was so large -- 46.4 percent of the state’s total acreage in those crops -- McKissick said it is fair to project the direct cost to farmers was about $140 million. The report couches that conclusion because responses to the survey were voluntary, but McKissick feels confident the projection is valid.""It wasn’t a random survey,"" he said. ""But you rarely ever get a survey that covers that amount of acreage.""So, if the impact to farmers was $140 million, where did Flemming get his figure?Along with the direct impact on farmers, the UGA report projected an indirect impact of the lost harvest on the rest of the state’s economy. Truck drivers, grocery store workers, even accountants get hurt indirectly when crops don’t get to market, McKissick said.The report calculated both the direct (to the farmers) and indirect (to the rest of us) impacts of the labor shortage to be $391 million. That’s the ""close to $400 million"" that Flemming got from the AJC article he scanned on his way to the rally.For the record, the AJC article reported the projected loss was for the entire state economy, not just farmers. Flemming said he may have misread the story before speaking, but he said the larger point remains.""It was a significant hit for our state,"" he said. ""This law has cost the state a lot of money. It’s hurt and is continuing to hurt.""That’s the second question: Is HB 87 the culprit?The UGA report is based on losses from the spring harvest -- which is the largest and most significant harvest in the state for fruits and veggies. But HB 87 did not take effect until July 1, so how could it have caused the shortage?That’s conjecture, McKissick said, but it is not that hard to make the connection.""The bill had been passed, but even though it had not gone into effect, it created an atmosphere where people had a lot of questions,"" he said.The report itself does not draw that conclusion, but McKissick said both the labor shortage and legislative promises to crack down on illegal immigrants occurred simultaneously.A follow-up study has not been done, but McKissick said he expects the economic ripples will continue as farmers cut back on their spring crop acreage.""We did ask in the survey whether or not the results of the labor shortage would impact their production decisions for the fall and the following year’s crop,"" he said. ""There was a good number that said it would affect their decisions, so there probably is a multiyear impact.""So Flemming was wrong in attributing the entire loss to farmers, but he was in the neighborhood when he said agricultural losses were about $400 million if you count indirect losses. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty that HB 87 caused the labor problem, although McKissick and others believe the two are linked.There are a couple of problems with Flemming’s statement. It’s not completely clear that HB 87 is responsible for all of the farm losses. But even if it is, the amount of those losses if far less than he stated.There’s a kernel of truth to what he said. But just a kernel. That’s fits our definition of Mostly False.  Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021","/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/",,"Georgia,Immigration,Charlie Flemming",,,,,

Bob McDonnell recently added a new argument to his contention that President Barack Obama’s economic policies have failed.""We’re recovering slower than Europe and other Western countries because I think our policies for jobs and energy are just anemic with this White House,"" McDonnell said in an April 21 interview on Bloomberg TV.The economic news from abroad is hardly inspiring these days: crushing Greek debt; 24 percent unemployment in Spain; Britain falling back into recession. So we wondered whether the United States’ recovery really is trailing Europe’s.We asked the governor’s office for proof of McDonnell’s European claim and asked it to identify the ""other Western countries"" he referred to. Spokeswoman Taylor Thornley sent us an email with no answers, but saying, ""Unemployment is too high. The national debt is out of control. And too many people are out of work.""So we turned to data tables. Economists told us a standard way to examine the pace of the economy is to examine growth in gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in a country.At the time McDonnell made his statement, quarterly GDP figures through the end of 2011 were the latest ones available.Tables from the European Union’s economics statistics office show the 27 countries in the European Union, on average, were growing faster than the U.S. in the first quarter of 2011 and that trends evened out in the second quarter. In the second half of last year, U.S. GDP was rising at a faster clip than Europe.In the EU, GDP rose 1.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and but dropped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The U.S., saw its economic output rise 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 3 percent in the fourth quarter.Only five of 33 European nations grew faster than the U.S. in the second half of 2011: Poland, Iceland, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. Iceland is not a member of the EU.In the weeks and days before McDonnell made his statement, international organizations that track the global economy released growth projections for the U.S. and Europe for this year.Figures released on April 17 by the International Monetary Fund show that U.S. GDP in 2012 is expected to grow 2.1 percent in 2012. That’s a bit quicker than the 1.7 percent increase the U.S. saw through all of 2011.Throughout Europe, GDP grew 2 percent in 2011, but that is expected fall to 0.2 percent this year.On March 29, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group representing three dozen developed nations, released its projections for GDP growth in the first half of 2012.""Our forecast for the first half of 2012 points to robust growth in the United States and Canada, but much weaker activity in Europe where the outlook remains fragile,"" Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD’s chief economist said in a news release.  Figures in the report show that U.S. GDP growth at the end of 2011 was outpacing the major economies in Europe -- Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom -- which were shrinking or barely growing. Through the first half of 2012, U.S. growth was expected to outpace all those European nations.Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McDonnell is off base when he asserts Europe is recovering faster than the U.S.""The United States, while its growth has not been spectacular, it certainly is growing modestly,"" Lachman said. ""Europe has just moved into recession. The last two quarters in Europe, many of the countries, you had negative growth.""Only four European nations -- Poland, Iceland, Turkey and the Slovak Republic -- are expected to see their GDP rise at a faster clip than the U.S. this year, according to IMF data.We also looked at unemployment rates in the U.S. and the European Union. We were unable to make an exact comparison because not all European nations define unemployment the same way as the U.S.This much is clear, however: The unemployment rate in European Union Nations rose from 9.4 percent in March 2011 to 10.2 percent in March 2012. During the same two months, the U.S. rate fell from 8.9 percent to 8.2 percent.Our rulingMcDonnell said the U.S. recovery is slower than Europe’s. But looking at the continent as a whole the opposite is true.U.S. economic growth gained steam during the second half of 2011 while Europe’s started to flag. This year U.S. GDP is expected to grow at a higher pace than last year while Europe’s growth, is expected to be flat.Only five outpaced the United States in economic growth during the last half of 2011. Only four are expected to outperform the U.S. this year. This information was available before the governor made his comment.

The state’s net loss of jobs far surpassed the next highest amount of 3,500 jobs lost in Mississippi. The March 2012 figures are preliminary and subject to change.Nearly 75 percent of the jobs lost in Wisconsin during the past year occurred in the public sector, which accounted for 17,800 of the job losses.Steven Deller, a professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that the political dynamics in the state has negatively impacted the business climate.""In addition to the massive budget cuts at the state and local level the political dynamics has cast a black cloud over the business climate of the state,"" Deller told us in an e-mail. ""People/businesses are starting to say ‘stop the political war and work together’. This is independent of party affiliation.""In case you’re wondering how job growth in New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation, here are the Garden State’s statistics:From March 2011 to March 2012, New Jersey gained 38,300 jobs for an increase of 1 percent. That growth represents increases of 35,200 private-sector jobs and 3,100 public-sector jobs.For total employment changes among all 50 states, New Jersey ranked 15th in net terms and 24th in percentage terms.Our rulingIn a news release issued Monday, Buono offered this statistic about the Badger State: ""Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state.""According to federal labor statistics, Buono’s claim is accurate.

According to its yearly property reports, the number of underutilized buildings numbered 43,360 in fiscal year 2008 and 45,190 in fiscal year 2009.

Joshua McKoon, by some accounts, committed political suicide this year.The freshman Republican from Columbus proposed legislation to cap gifts from lobbyists to state lawmakers at $100. Statehouse leaders apparently didn’t care for his approach, removing McKoon from a committee to study the idea. There’s been mumbling, as one former senator put it, that Republicans were recruiting a candidate to run against McKoon.""I have not been making a lot of friends inside the Capitol,"" McKoon said, when asked by PolitiFact Georgia about his proposal.Throughout the legislative session, McKoon attempted to buttress his argument with a fact to help fellow lawmakers see the light.Georgia, he said, is one of three states that ""effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators.""The other states, he says, are Indiana and South Dakota.McKoon held a news conference last month and pointed to a map of the United States with those three states in red. So, is McKoon correct?Government watchdog groups have argued ardently in recent years that Georgia needs to tighten its ethics laws and make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence state lawmakers with gifts of meals or trips. A recent joint report by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity ranked Georgia last in the nation in the strength of its laws on public corruption and government openness. Some state lawmakers called the report biased.Georgia code section 21-5-11 spells out the policy on gifts. It says that only statewide elected officials can accept gifts of more than $100 for a speech, seminar or panel discussion that directly relates to the duties of that official, but prohibits it otherwise. It states no rules for members of the Georgia Legislature or other types of gifts. A section on prohibited lobbying practices, Title 28, Chapter 7, mentions nothing about gift limits.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution took a close look at lobbyists during the recent legislative session. A recent AJC story found lobbyists spent $866,747 --- the equivalent of $9,525 per day --- on gifts for lawmakers from Jan. 1 through March 31.Many of the gifts would have easily surpassed the $100 limit McKoon proposed. For example, the AJC found lobbyists took Rep. Mickey Channell, R-Greensboro, and his wife to dinner on Valentine’s Day, spending about $230. Another House member, Rahn Mayo, D-Decatur, said he was unaware that the four Atlanta Hawks basketball tickets that lobbyists gave him cost about $500.House Speaker David Ralston has defended the current system, saying eliminating lobbying gifts would drive the practice ""underground,"" where the public would know less about what is happening between lawmakers and special interests.So how does Georgia compare with other states when it comes to laws on gifts from lobbyists?The National Conference of State Legislatures has a chart that examines gift policy in each state. McKoon said he used the NCSL chart to make his claim. Many states employ what’s referred to as the ""cup of coffee"" policy, which prohibits any gifts whatsoever from lobbyists. About a dozen states set the limit at $100. Four states set the limit at $250. A handful limit gifts from lobbyists to between $250 and $1,000.The NCSL chart says Indiana requires lobbyists to report gifts, but does not specify any limits of what they can give lawmakers. In 2010, state lawmakers changed some of the rules on gifts from lobbyists. They must now disclose any gifts in a day greater than $50. Before, the limit was $100, said Julia Vaughn, Common Cause Indiana policy director.""We don’t limit. We require some disclosure,"" Vaughn said.Vaughn said some state lawmakers argue a gift ban isn’t necessary because it’s better for the public to know what they’re getting from lobbyists.In South Dakota, the code section on lobbyists mentions nothing about gift limits for lobbyists. The NCSL lists South Dakota as having ""no restrictions.""We found no discrepancies in the NCSL’s research. The current laws in Georgia, Indiana and South Dakota afford lobbyists freedom to give state lawmakers as much as they want.

Another says at least 25 offenders escaped to the mountains.Any reference to the United States? No. Arizona? No. March 2012? No.A quick Web search for roads identified in the photo captions turns up another false note: a YouTube video posted not last month, but in May 2010. It includes the same images repeated in the email message.The Mexican town of Higueras, it turns out, is about 800 miles from the Arizona border. It’s more than 130 miles from Nuevo Laredo, Texas.

The advertisement’s money moment, though, lies in these claims that appear in red letters next to video of Obama, in shorts, golfing: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf.""We’re separately analyzing Dewhurst’s charge about American poverty. But is he right that Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf, meaning as many as 1,620 holes?Many presidents have played golf, including 15 of the 18 presidents before Obama, according to a January 2009 Golf Digest article,The magazine ranked John F. Kennedy as the best previous presidential golfer, and his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, as second-best; Eisenhower, the article says, had a putting green outside the Oval Office.As Dewhurst’s backup for the Obama claim, his campaign pointed us to a January 2012 Washington Post blog post noting that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bemoaned Obama’s ""90 rounds"" at the Jan. 23, 2012, GOP presidential debate in Tampa. According to the debate transcript, Romney said: ""We have to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work."" He later brought up the 90 rounds again at a Michigan campaign event, according to a Feb. 14, 2012, article in the Detroit News.Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch also offered as backup a Dec. 27, 2011, blog post by Tina Korbe on the Hot Air website, which describes itself as ""the leading conservative blog for breaking news and commentary covering the Republican primary, the 2012 election, politics, media, and culture."" Korbe’s post states, in part: ""Not only did Barack Obama golf on Christmas day, but he hit the links yesterday, too — and that round marked the 90th of his presidency.""Korbe’s post linked to a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post by White House correspondent Keith Koffler, whose website is WhiteHouseDossier.com. Koffler’s post said: ""After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president."" His summary also says that this was ""the 32nd time he’s been on the links this year, a record for the president. His 32 outings eclipses the 2010 mark of 30 and is far ahead of his 2009 tally of 28 rounds as president.""By email, we asked Koffler about those figures. He replied that as of April 4, 2012, the president had taken in 93 golf outings, counting one in 2012 and 34 in 2011.We wondered how the frequency of Obama’s golf outings compared to such expeditions by other presidents. Koffler replied: ""I don't have a comparison to other presidents, though (George W.) Bush stopped in 2003.""Bush said in a May 2008 interview with Politico and Yahoo News that he decided to forgo golf after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello, the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization’s high commissioner for human rights. ""I remember when de Mello, who was at the U.N., got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man's life,"" Bush said, according to Politico. ""I was playing golf — I think I was in Central Texas — and they pulled me off the golf course and I said, ‘It's just not worth it any more to do.’""We didn’t immediately hear back from the White House about how often Obama has gone golfing.Separately, CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks each president’s activities, responded to our inquiry by pointing out that he said on Twitter April 2, 2012, that Obama had just played his first round of golf of the year, spending five hours on a course the day before. Knoller told us by email that the round was Obama’s 93rd as president.We rate Dewhurst’s claim as True.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021","http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/2009-02/presidentsranking,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/republican-debates--keep-em-coming/2012/01/23/gIQABhVSMQ_blog.html,http://www.cfr.org/us-election-2012/republican-debate-transcript-tampa-florida-january-2012/p27180,http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120214/POLITICS01/202140421,http://hotair.com/archives/2011/12/27/obligatory-obama-plays-90th-round-of-golf-in-hawaii/,http://hotair.com/,http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2011/12/26/obama-golfs-90th-time-president/,http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10314.html,https://twitter.com/#%21/markknoller/status/186800915179765761,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Economy,Poverty,Recreation,Texas,David Dewhurst",,,,,

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has again weighed in on one of its provisions. Like many other Republicans, she is attacking the Independent Payment Advisory Board created in the legislation and voted to repeal the provision last month. The board is intended to rein in Medicare costs beginning in 2015 with Congress required to either accede to its recommendations or act to overrule them.Specifically, Blackburn said: ""Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the President and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.""We asked Blackburn spokesman Mike Reynard for evidence backing the claim and he referred to Section 3403 of the law where the board is established and to an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. Ryan said the board would be ""empowered by the new health-care law to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for seniors.""Our PolitFact Ohio colleagues took a look at a similar assertion about the IPAB by the former ""Tutti Frutti"" crooner Pat Boone on March 11 and rated it a ""Pants on Fire"" distortion of the truth.Closer to what Blackburn said about the IPAB are the statements PolitiFact national  looked at from of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and PolitiFact Georgia looked at from U.S. Rep. Phil G Gingrey, R-Ga., the latter an obstetrician-gynecologist. Both suggested the IPAB’s ""bureaucrats"" would make medical decisions for patients. In both instances, those assertions were rated False.PolitiFact Georgia asked four different health experts about Gingrey’s claim that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" would ""decide whether you get care."" All four said Gingrey was wrong. Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said that the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is ""not even close to correct."" Cato scholar Michael Tanner is himself an opponent of IPAB but nonetheless said: ""It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals.""The letter of the law shows the board has nothing to do with individual patients or their health care decisions, but would suggest cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices – like hip replacements – should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care.Blackburn couches her statement about the IPAB in the context of physicians cutting back on the number of Medicare patients they treat and suggests that, with the IPAB, ""this problem will only get worse, leaving our seniors without the necessary access to physicians they deserve."" This overstates the case. Some physicians are not taking on new Medicare patients for a variety of reasons, including low reimbursement rates. And it’s true the board could recommend lower rates for some procedures and discourage more doctors from taking on new patients. But the board is mandated to do so on a medically sound basis. The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out.Gingrey also made an assertion that the board will be stocked with ""unelected bureaucrats,"" and said it would be capable of making life-and-death decisions. That was found to be just not false but outrageous by PolitiFact Georgia. ""This claim is incorrect,"" it said ""The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care.""Blackburn’s claim that the IPAB will consist of ""15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington,"" like Bachmann’s grievance that the IPAB consists of political appointees, ""leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements,"" as PolitiFact National put it in its check of Bachmann’s claims about the IPAB.The law states that the members ""shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives.""It also says the board ""shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly.""And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care ""shall not"" constitute a majority of the board’s members.The president appoints 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate, and there are three ex-oficio members.Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment.Our rulingBlackburn to her credit did not mention rationing -- connecting that practice to the IPAB is what pushed Boone’s claim to judged ridiculously false. But she did say that President Obama -- through the law -- would be giving the ""power"" to control Medicare patients’ health-care decisions to ""a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.""Since we find that the IPAB would not control decisions made at the individual patient level, we rate it False.  Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021","http://blackburn.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=282551,https://www.healthcare.gov/law/full/,https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304636404577291221193908272.html?mod=googlenews_wsj,https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/mar/19/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-health-care-advisory-board-can-rati/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/ipab-board-15-bureaucrats-who-will-decide-nation-s/,https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/aug/02/phil-gingrey/gingrey-claims-federal-health-care-board-can-decid/,https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1899A.htm,http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/survey-doctors-dropping-out-medicare,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/15/AR2010081502470.html,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"Tennessee,Health Care,Marsha Blackburn",,,,,

Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard.We looked into that figure amid debate over the state’s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007.To participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do.That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood.Under the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam.The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms.Naishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the ""nearly 45 percent"" figure came from ""multiple sources,"" including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state’s Women’s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood — which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators’ reference solely to ""health screenings.""Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings.Asked about the figure that Naishtat’s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That’s 46.1 percent.We wondered, though, if it’s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats’ article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Also, the Democrats’ article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings.That might not be so. According to the commission’s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women’s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women’s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood.In a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider.For one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases — and the state couldn’t tell us how many of them there were — the only ""services"" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats’ statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood.But under the program, it’s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010.And if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent.Goodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue.Our rulingThe Democratic legislators wrote that nearly 45 percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted family-planning program in fiscal 2010 had them at Planned Parenthood clinics.That could be so, but we identified a couple of unsettled hitches.According to the state, 46 percent of the cited program’s clients went to a Planned Parenthood clinic, but the state has no breakdown of the number of women who were screened overall, which is what the Democrats focused on. Also, the Democrats’ statement implies that 46 percent of women rely on Planned Parenthood exclusively for screenings, but some women included in the 46 percent could have had screenings at a different kind of clinic, though (again) such details are not available.We rate the claim Half True.","http://www.statesman.com/opinion/move-that-hurts-women-is-political-not-economical-2218947.html?printArticle=y,https://www.texastribune.org/texas-health-resources/abortion-texas/suehs-signs-rule-banning-abortion-affiliates/,http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/WomensHealth/InformationforProviders.html#_Covered_Services,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/mar/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2010-nearly-80-women-served-womens/",,"Abortion,Health Care,Public Health,Women,Texas,Elliott Naishtat",,,,,

White asked. ""And please do not say waste and fraud, which is something everyone always brings up but is really a drop in the fiscal bucket.""Doherty then proceeded to talk about, well, waste and fraud.""We’ve had a tremendous amount of waste in the federal government,"" Doherty said. ""We have people that are gaming the system … We have $60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud.""That sounded to us like a huge amount. If Doherty’s claim is true, it would support his contention that taxpayers could actually save a lot of money if waste and fraud are reined in.Other fact-checkers have looked at Medicare fraud estimates. Politifact National gave Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn a Half True ruling after he claimed that the country spent $80 billion a year on fraudulent Medicare payments.While we waited to hear back from Doherty’s campaign, we did some research.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) -- the investigative arm of Congress -- has since 1990 labeled Medicare a ""high-risk program,"" because of the ample opportunities for error and abuse in the system that covers 47 million elderly and disabled Americans.The GAO issued a report a year ago that gave a total figure for ""improper payments"" for 2010 of $48 billion. That was the equivalent of 9.4 percent of the $509 billion in total spending that year for Medicare.The GAO pulled the figure from the Fiscal Year 2010 financial report for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicare and came up with an estimate for improper payments based on a random sampling of 82,000 Medicare claims. The GAO report did not include questionable payments made under Medicare’s Part D prescription drug program, for which no estimate was provided by HHS -- so the total amount of improper payments is likely higher.The report defines an improper payment as ""any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount [including overpayments and underpayments] under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements.""Typical types of fraud that fall under the umbrella of improper payments include billing for services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, over-billing for services, paying kickbacks and stealing providers’ or patients’ identities.It’s important to note that the $48-billion figure cited by the GAO is for all ""improper payments,"" not just the fraud that Doherty is targeting.The GAO report did not isolate the amount of money spent specifically on fraudulent Medicare payments because the Department of Health has no method to detect or measure fraud.But officials do believe that the level of fraud is high.In May 6, 2009 testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Daniel Levin, HHS inspector general, estimated that ""more than $60 billion each year"" is lost to health care fraud, citing a figure from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), a group that includes members from private insurance companies, law enforcement and government agencies.Many media outlets and critics of government health care programs have used that $60 billion figure when describing the extent of Medicare fraud. Doherty’s campaign referred us to several news stories that cite the number, including pieces by 60 Minutes and USA Today that both quoted Attorney General Eric Holder.But those stories used an incorrect description of the number because it covers the entire U.S. health care industry, including public and private providers, not just Medicare -- a big distinction.We watched the 60 Minutes piece cited by Doherty’s campaign. Like other media reports, it does not give an attribution for the $60-billion figure. The USA Today piece with the $60 billion figure cites a speech at a national conference by Holder as its source of the information. In a transcript we found of the speech, however, Holder made it clear he was referring to fraud for the entire health care industry -- not just the Medicare fraud Doherty was talking about.The NHCAA generally estimates that fraud accounts for 3 percent of all health care spending. So in 2010, when the country spent $2.3 trillion on health care, the cost of fraud was estimated to be $69 billion, according to the association. It did not come up with a specific figure for Medicare, but if we use its 3 percent estimate, then Medicare fraud would have amounted to about $15 billion in 2010 -- a quarter of Doherty’s figure.The NHCAA also cites an estimate from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that fraud amounts to between 3 and 10 percent of total spending on health care annually. If Medicare fraud were as high as 10 percent, it would have totaled about $51 billion in 2010 -- still less than Doherty’s estimate.Others have come up with higher estimates for health care fraud, but none have isolated a number for Medicare. They include Malcolm Sparrow, a former fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service who is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of ""License to Steal,"" a book on health care fraud, and has testified before Congress on Medicare fraud, waste and related issues.Sparrow believes the amount of health care fraud is much higher than the 3 percent, or $69 billion, estimate by the NHCAA, but in an email to us he emphasized that there are no ""valid estimates"" for Medicare fraud.Our rulingBrendan Doherty said there was $60 billion in Medicare fraud in 2010.The truth is, nobody really knows how much money is spent on fraudulent Medicare claims. Even the government agency that regulates Medicare has not -- and apparently cannot -- come up with a firm figure.While experts say the amount of fraud in the entire health care system could range from $69 billion to hundreds of billions of dollars, only the GAO study isolated improper payments for Medicare specifically. Its $48-billion estimate, which also includes wasteful spending, is $12 billion -- or 20 percent -- less than Doherty’s number for fraud alone.Doherty’s campaign didn’t pull the $60 billion number from thin air. Staffers found multiple reports using that figure from credible media outlets. But those media outlets used it inaccurately.It’s understandable why Doherty believed those reports -- especially for a number that’s pretty squishy -- but if stamping out waste and fraud is indeed one of the core issues of his candidacy, he at least should have gotten his information from a first-hand source.We rate Doherty’s statement Half True.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

In it, he took a series of shots at President Barack Obama’s energy policies.""This president’s agenda doesn’t just stop with oil and gas,"" Santorum wrote. ""President Obama has also discouraged new electricity generation -- forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts. That means that millions of Americans will live with a power grid that is second-rate, like a Third World country.""We hadn't noticed the lights cycling off, so we wondered: Are many parts of the country really experiencing ""rolling blackouts""?Before we go any further, let's define our terms. A ""rolling blackout"" occurs when a utility intentionally ""shuts off the power to an area, turns it back on, and then shuts the power off in a different area,"" with outages in any given area typically lasting 60 to 90 minutes, according to the California Energy Commission. A utility would do this as a last resort, in order to avoid an even worse situation -- a total power blackout.A rolling blackout is distinct from two other electrical problems. Brownouts are temporary reductions in current, intentional or unintentional, which may or may not be noticeable to a customer. An uncontrolled outage occurs when power is disrupted without warning, often by weather or accidents. Rolling blackouts typically occur during 3 to 7 p.m., hours of peak use, when demand for electricity begins to exceed the local utility's available supply, the commission explained. ""These controlled or planned blackouts help prevent ‘uncontrolled’ electrical power outages during the peak periods, which assures your electricity supply remains continuous and with minimal interruptions.""Typically, utilities will try to forestall rolling blackouts by first issuing calls for customers to limit their power use and then by activating a system under which certain customers have agreed to limit their power uptake on high-demand days.So how often do rolling blackouts occur today? The Santorum campaign didn’t get back to us, but from what we can tell, it’s not all that often.We found data from Eaton Corp., a private power management company that publishes an annual ""Blackout Tracker."" (It can be downloaded here, free with registration.)Overall, in 2011 Eaton counted 3,071 power outages affecting 41.8 million Americans. That’s a modest decrease in outages from the previous year, but a big increase in the number of Americans affected; in 2010, 17.5 million Americans were affected. The difference is partly due to Hurricane Irene, which cut power to 6 million people, following two relatively quiet years for hurricanes.Weather is the principal cause of power outages in the U.S., according to Eaton. Here's the company's breakdown of what caused blackouts in 2011, where causes could be determined:Weather: 1,229Faulty equipment or human error: 767Vehicle accident: 245Animal: 208Planned: 138Theft or vandalism: 28Rolling blackouts would be ""planned"" outages, so at most, just 5 percent of these power outages might have been rolling blackouts. For comparison, that’s about as many power outages as were caused by squirrels in 2011.Really. Eaton tracked that in another chart.A range of experts we spoke to said they knew of no epidemic of rolling blackouts in the United States in recent years.""The Electric Power Research Institute is not aware of any rolling blackouts cascading throughout the country,"" said Clay Perry, the senior media relations manager for EPRI, a research group on the generation, delivery and use of electricity. ""Do share if you can find any.""As for Santorum's suggestion that Obama is to blame for the non-existent widespread rolling blackouts, it’s worth noting the limits of Obama’s power on the electric power supply. While Obama has pushed for improvements to the electrical grid, ""political decisions about power generation and distribution are largely a state regulatory matter,"" with additional roles played by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is an independent federal agency, and various regional grid reliability councils, said Stephen Brown, a fellow with Resources for the Future and adjunct professor in energy management at the University of Colorado.There was at least one high-profile case of rolling blackouts in 2011 -- in early February in Texas, when the state, shivering in an unusual cold snap, imposed rolling blackouts for just the second time in more than two decades. The blackouts ""left nearly 1 million homes dark and without heat for up to an hour, caused some schools and businesses to shut and spurred traffic snarls as some traffic lights stopped working,"" Reuters reported.According to the Houston Chronicle, Trip Doggett, the CEO of the state's main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the rolling blackouts were not caused by a failure to predict demand accurately or to keep enough plants online but by a widespread mechanical failure of more than 50 power generating units across the state. There was no single reason for the failures and no particular location, plant operator or type of power plant behind the problem, Doggett said.Critics of Obama seized on the Texas rolling blackouts as evidence that the president’s policies were endangering the nation’s energy future. The impact of Obama’s policies on energy supplies is a topic of heated disagreement, but that’s not what we're checking here. Rather, we’re checking whether such policies are already ""forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts"" -- and the data and expert opinions don't back that up.Our rulingSantorum’s said that Obama’s policies have forced ""many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts"" -- evoking images of Third World countries. But neither Santorum nor experts offered any evidence that widespread rolling blackouts have occured. Arguably, squirrels are as much a threat to the power supply today.

In his speech, Obama laid out a defense of his oil-related policies and reiterated his commitment to diverse energy sources.One of his speech’s shortest lines caught our attention: ""We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.""Thirty years -- really? And why has it been so long? To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to check it out. (We fact-checked Obama’s claims about drilling in a separate report.)If you haven’t been keeping tabs on the nuclear energy industry, it has indeed been awhile since a new reactor was built. But Obama’s 30-year claim hinges on licensing.On Feb. 9, 2012, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The electricity giant Southern Co. intends to build them at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. (The White House pointed us to news coverage of the approval when we asked for evidence of Obama’s statement.)Prior to this year, the last time the commission granted a license to build a new reactor was in 1978, which was 34 years ago, according to a commission spokesperson. The permit was for the Shearon Harris plant operated by Carolina Power & Light near Raleigh, N.C. But it takes a long time to build nuclear reactors, so the plant didn’t get operational approval until 1986.And the North Carolina plant isn’t the most recent to go operational. That distinction goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar site in Tennessee. It received a construction license in 1973 and an operating license in 1996, or 16 years ago.Still, as we ran this claim by people who watch the nuclear industry closely -- both those opposed to nuclear energy and those in favor of it -- they agreed Obama’s claim to have ""supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades"" was largely accurate.A technical note: The Georgia project adds two reactors to an existing electricity generation site with two existing reactors. We wondered if that diminished the accuracy of Obama’s statement, but the experts said it’s fair to call each reactor its own ""power plant.""Nuclear’s long waitSo why has it been so long since a license was granted?Interestingly, the experts we spoke with said it’s not because of bureaucratic hassles or super-stringent rules. Rather, it’s because building new plants is expensive, and the dynamics of the energy market haven’t made new reactors a good deal for energy producers.The Nuclear Information and Resource Service opposes nuclear energy as ""dangerous, dirty and expensive,"" said executive director Michael Mariotte. It’s the expensive part that’s made for the long wait, he said.Energy companies have struggled to build plants in a cost-efficient manner, and the Georgia plants are a long way from being finished, he said. The Southern Co. is trying to construct two reactors at once, which makes for more operational complexity.""If history repeats itself, then they won’t get built. We’ll have to see how much the industry has learned in the past three decades in terms of managing construction costs,"" he said.His group is part of a lawsuit to stop the construction, on the grounds that the reactor designs need to be updated with lessons learned from the recent nuclear disaster near Fukushima, Japan. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license on a 4-1 vote; the dissenting vote was cast for that reason.)A sunnier take on the three-decade wait is that the nuclear industry has been really good at innovating and getting more electricity out of its existing plants. That’s what Steve Kerekes of the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute told us.""From essentially a static number of facilities -- a little over 100 --we’ve increased our electricity output roughly 40 percent. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 new reactors since 1990, and we’ve done that from existing facilities,"" he said.Nuclear executives say they would build more plants if the current energy markets were different. The Georgia plant is going forward in a state where regulations allow utilities to bill customers for construction costs before the plant is finished.By way of contrast, the Illinois-based nuclear energy company Exelon operates in many states where that’s not the case. Exelon executives have said plainly it makes little economic sense for them to build new plants, citing two more factors. First, natural gas prices are very low. Second, Congress has abandoned plans to address global warming through a cap-and-trade system or other attempts to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. Both those things work against the business case for building new reactors. (Exelon executives, by the way, donated to Obama’s 2008 campaign, as we noted in this fact-check.)The administration’s supportObama said in his speech that his administration ""supported"" the new nuclear plants. Again, experts agreed this was so, particularly since the administration is in final negotiations to support the Southern Co.’s construction with $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees.Back in February 2010, when the project received conditional approval, Obama himself praised the deal, connecting it to the need for climate change legislation.""To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to increase our supply of nuclear power, and today’s announcement helps to move us down that path,"" he said.Our rulingObama said, ""We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades."" He is right that it’s been that long since a new nuclear reactor has been licensed. However, because it takes so long to construct nuclear power plants, the most recent plant actually opened in 1996.The experts we spoke with, both those who support nuclear power and those who oppose it, said that Obama’s statement was largely accurate, given that the last time a nuclear reactor received federal approval was 1978. And, his administration has so far supported the recent approval of new reactors in Georgia with $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees.We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-says-us-has-record-number-oil-rigs-operating/,http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col/vogtle.html,https://www.ajc.com/business/plant-vogtle-nuclear-expansion-1340522.html,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/hillary-clinton/exelon-staff-supports-obama/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/post-about-keystone-pipeline-falsely-claims-buffet/",,"Florida,Energy,Government Regulation,Nuclear,Regulation,Barack Obama",,,,,

While the test carries a less than 1 percent risk of miscarriage, it can be used to diagnose gene and chromosomal disorders, neural tube defects, blood disorders and infections.Santorum told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer that it’s used to ""recommend abortion.""""Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion,"" he explained during the CBS News interview on Feb. 19, 2012.We wondered, does the diagnostic test ""result more often than not in this country in abortion""?We reached out to government agencies, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guttmacher Institute, the March of Dimes and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations.There’s no national source any of these groups knew of that tracks amniocentesis procedures and their outcomes. But there’s good evidence Santorum overstated his case.The interviewIn Santorum’s Face the Nation interview, host Schieffer referred to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio. Schieffer said, ""You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … Any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all.""Santorum responded, ""Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.""After mentioning his daughter Bella’s diagnosis with the serious chromosomal disorder Trisomy 18, Santorum added: ""We had a sonogram done there and they detected a problem. And yes, the doctor said, you know, you should consider an abortion.""This is typical, Bob, this is what goes on in medical rooms around the country. And yes, prenatal testing, amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion. That is a fact.""Separately, we checked Santorum’s statement from the same interview that ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."" (We found that Half True — some regional studies bear him out, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it’s difficult to generalize for the entire nation.)Here, we’re focusing on his statement, ""Amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion.""The dataWe asked Santorum’s campaign for support for his claim, but didn’t hear back.We would have appreciated some guidance, because as we mentioned, no government agency or major professional group we found tracks amniocentesis and parents’ choices afterward. We checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, who referred us to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.""Our scientific staff notes that there is no national source that tracks amniocentesis procedures, and the NIH does not have any information on the proportion of cases in which amniocentesis is performed and which subsequently end in pregnancy termination,"" Robert Bock of the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development told us.The Guttmacher Institute, which does research on sexual and reproductive health, including abortion, doesn’t keep data on parents’ choices after amniocentesis. Neither does the March of Dimes, which offers information about genetic disorders and birth defects.That left the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional group with 52,000 members. It doesn’t collect data on amniocentesis procedures, either.But a spokesman did refer us to an expert in prenatal diagnosis.The researchersThat means checking this claim comes down to individual studies and researchers who study parents’ responses to prenatal diagnosis.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggested we speak with Mark Evans, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He’s also president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America, president of the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society Foundation and past president of the Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.He noted something that other experts we talked with also quickly pointed out: More than 90 percent of the time, the results of amniocentesis are normal, and parents go on to have healthy children.So, based on that, Santorum is incorrect.Meanwhile, when doctors do find a problem, only about half of patients choose to end their pregnancies, Evans said — and there’s a direct relationship between the severity of the problem and parents’ choice.There’s also a direct relationship between the region parents live in and the choices they make — something we pointed out in our rating about Down syndrome.""In liberal areas such as New York, probably 80 to 90 percent of parents with severe abnormalities do choose to terminate when legal to do so. In conservative areas, the proportion of termination is much lower — perhaps as little as 10 percent,"" Evans said.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021So Santorum might have been right if he had focused only on amniocentesis that results in diagnosis of a severe abnormality in liberal regions of the U.S. But his statement was much broader.Evans argues, in fact, that prenatal diagnosis allows for more healthy babies, both because accurate diagnoses help doctors treat fetuses with problems (he’s helped pioneer such in utero procedures as a stem-cell transplant for a fetus with a severely compromised immune system), and because accurate testing helps parents at high risk for passing on serious genetic abnormalities to confidently continue their pregnancies.""These are women who would not have otherwise gotten pregnant,"" he said.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists points out that in the case of a definitive diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome, the doctor and family have information to plan ahead for the rest of the pregnancy, labor and delivery.(That’s something former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who chose to have an amniocentesis, has said she was grateful for before the birth of her son, Trig.)Meanwhile, experts we spoke with disagree with Santorum that doctors ""encourage"" abortions.Prenatal diagnosis itself is an optional procedure, pointed out Miriam Kupperman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and epidemiology at University of California at San Francisco. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists merely recommends that testing be offered as an option to every pregnant woman.Invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis, are typically only conducted after screening such as a blood test shows a fetus is at higher risk. After diagnosis of an abnormality, abortion would be presented among a parent’s options, along with any possible treatment.Gene Rudd, an obstetrician/gynecologist and senior vice president of the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, said that day-to-day reality doesn’t always bear out such even-handed counseling — either before patients choose invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or afterward.""I just don't think they are being properly informed,"" he said. ""It's just so routine that when patients these days are given the option of giving the blood test, it's almost like it's not presented as an option. … Once that test is positive, the knee-jerk reaction is, you need an amniocentesis.""Like Santorum, Rudd said he’s concerned about mandating free coverage for amniocentesis because of its small risk of miscarriage and the fact that parents may choose to end their pregnancies based on a diagnosis.Still, the test can provide useful information in some cases when parents want to keep their pregnancies, he said.""There are a few conditions where the prenatal diagnosis can be important,"" he said. ""There are some preparatory things that make good sense. People can rationally choose to have amniocentesis for that. … I think that's admirable when people want to choose to do that.""Our rulingSantorum told Face the Nation, ""Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion."" While no agency or organization we spoke with keeps national statistics, researchers and reports we consulted show that more than 90 percent of amniocenteses result in normal diagnoses — and thus often healthy babies.

Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, was shut down by Democrats on the floor when he tried to extract a dead bill from committee. The legislation? To create a legislative committee to regularly review the need for state agencies, or else the agencies would expire on a rolling basis.In a remonstrance -- otherwise known as an expression of protest or complaint -- he said that such a committee would strengthen the legislative body.""It is, without question, a process that this Legislature hasn’t contemplated in the past,"" he said. ""Other states have. The federal government does. It would allow accountability in the process. Mr. President, and I would urge that in the future legislatures, that we consider this particular issue in a way that would be bipartisan and recognize the goal is to strengthen the Legislative Assembly.""Do other states regularly allow agencies to lapse unless lawmakers approve them? Does the federal government have such a commission itself? Majority Democrats in the Senate voted down Starr’s motion without discussion, but the questions for PolitiFact Oregon remained.In a follow-up interview, Starr said he got the idea from Texas, which has had a long-running sunset commission. He also clarified that the federal government does not have one commission overseeing multiple agencies, but that Congress regularly reviews certain spending provisions. And Starr owned up, as he did on the floor, to the reality that he didn’t expect the idea to move.An online search shows that the Texas Legislature created the Sunset Advisory Commission in 1977 ""to identify and eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiency in government agencies."" The 12-member commission reviews more than 150 government agencies every 12 years.Florida created one in 2006. California did in 2010. Minnesota followed last year when its 2011 Legislature created a Sunset Advisory Commission, which will periodically review state agencies and make recommendations on whether the agency should continue to exist. Most commissions and boards would expire automatically unless authorized; larger agencies would not expire automatically.""Sunset committees"" were something of a trend in the 1960s and 1970s, when many state legislatures were struggling for equal footing with the other branches of government, says Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures.In 1977, the Oregon Legislature created a sunset committee, the Associated Press reported, and hired staff to review nine state agencies slated to be killed by mid-1980 unless the 1979 Legislature voted to keep them. Legislators voted to kill the committee in 1993.Erickson said many states found the sunset schedule hard to maintain. ""Given staff limitations, they found it difficult to keep up,"" she said. ""They modified the sunset review period, and extended it, or removed it and transitioned into this (performance) review.""Most states have some kind of legislative authority to audit or review executive branch agencies, according to a 2008 survey conducted by NCSL. According to the Council of State Governments' Book of the States 2011, which uses 2009 data, about half of states have a sunset-type body.Congress is a different story; attempts to create an oversight commission haven’t succeeded. Republicans appear keener on the idea than Democrats. So there is no one commission currently in Congress that regularly reviews the need for federal agencies. But many, if not most, spending provisions for farms, defense, aviation, etc., technically require reauthorization or review every few years to continue.""The federal government does terminate a fair number of programs each year,""  said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, but generally this is done through the appropriations process. Most of those are ""small demonstration projects,"" he said.The left-leaning group doesn’t like the idea of a congressional sunset commission, but that’s neither here nor there for us. We’re not going to weigh in on whether the idea has merit. Starr said on the floor that other states have sunset oversight commissions, or had considered them. He said that the federal government does. His language on the floor was broad, although the bill in question, Senate Bill 1590, has some very strict dates on abolishing agencies.What do we know?Sunset committees were very popular with state legislatures, then became not as popular, and now may be making a comeback. It’s accurate to say that other states have contemplated the idea or have one.But it’s not accurate to suggest that the federal government has an oversight commission. The ability to review specific spending every few years isn’t the same thing as a broad-based commission with the power to kill agencies. Starr acknowledged as much in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon.His language on the floor was a little foggy and he clarified his comments in an interview. We don’t find this to be a significant piece of missing information, but feel readers should know the difference.

In the ad, a Romney look-alike, clad in a pitch-perfect white dress shirt and a tie, aims a paintball gun at cardboard cutouts of Santorum, hoping to cover them with mud.The visuals made the ad an instant classic, but the ad’s substance has received less attention in the media. We thought we’d look at one of the ad’s claims.One of the on-screen visuals said, ""Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare."" Is that correct?First, we should note that we’ve looked at previous claims that Romney’s health care law and Obama’s were similar and have found them to be generally accurate.To check the claim in the ad, we first turmed to the cited source for the claim, a transcript from rushlimbaugh.com. During his Oct. 13, 2011, show, the conservative talker discussed an appearance the previous night by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.We located the transcript for that episode of O’Donnell’s show. Here are some excerpts:O’Donnell: One of Gov. Romney's health care reform consultants was MIT economist Jonathan Gruber. He attended five of the 12 meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. Joining me now, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jonathan Gruber. Thanks for joining me tonight, professor.Gruber: You bet, Lawrence. Good to be here.   O’Donnell: All right. Come on, come clean. You were in the room with President Obama discussing health care reform. And you did, in fact, work with the Romney administration in Massachusetts. Come on, professor, you have to tell us the truth.Gruber: The truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally. John McDonough (the executive director of Health Care For All, a Massachusetts consumer health advocacy organization and) one of the other advisers who worked in both Massachusetts and advised the White House, said it's the Massachusetts bill with three more zeros. That's basically a good description of what the federal bill did.O’Donnell: It is kind of laughable that we've actually reach the point where we have the great investigative reporter Michael Isikoff actually going in there to get these kind of diary facts in the White House to sort of prove what we all know. I want you to listen to what Mitt Romney had to say when he was signing the bill in Massachusetts.(In video clip) Mitt Romney: I want to thank the many, many people in this room who were critical to crafting and coaxing the bold health care initiative that I'm about to sign. Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model.O’Donnell: That's for the econometric model, professor. He didn't mention you last night in his answer, when he was asked about, you know, who helped him and who helped President Obama?Gruber: I'm hurt, Lawrence. I think I'll live.So, Romney’s hat-tip in the signing ceremony confirms that Gruber helped put together portions of the Massachusetts health care bill. And we think it’s fair to use the term ""blueprint"" to describe Gruber’s comment that ""the truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally.""The ad’s only failing is not describing Gruber as a ""former adviser."" Gruber is not advising Romney’s presidential run, but one could easily think so when reading the screen text.We checked with Gruber to see what he thought.""Yes, that is pretty much right, if you add that I’m a former Romney adviser,"" he said. He added a bit of praise for the ad-maker.""It’s funny, at the start of the ad, I thought the guy didn't look like Romney -- too muscular -- but from the angles at the end of the ad, he did look a lot like him.""Our rulingAccording to the ad, a ""Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare."" Stick a ""former"" in front of ""Romney adviser"" and it would have been correct.

""We must reverse this trend.""In the days afterward, the governor reiterated this commitment. During a Feb. 3 appearance on Channel 12’s ""Newsmakers,"" Chafee pointed to the negative effects of an increasing reliance on property taxes in Rhode Island’s economically distressed communities -- Central Falls, West Warwick, Pawtucket and, of course, Providence.""And no wonder there’s empty stores in Providence,"" he said. ""The commercial property tax is second highest in the country behind Detroit.""The issue of property taxes has come to the fore in Providence with the ongoing fight between the financially struggling city and its tax-exempt nonprofits. Providence leans heavily on tax payments from businesses and residents to raise revenue. But is the city’s commercial property tax really the nation’s second highest?Chafee’s spokeswoman referred us to a report released last month by a financial panel advising Providence. The report, ""A System Out of Balance,"" from the Commission on Revenue, Sustainability and Efficiency, recommended a series of changes to raise money for the city, including higher sales tax receipts, more state aid and larger contributions from Providence’s nine colleges and hospitals.To put the issue in context, the report included a comparison of commercial property tax burdens in Providence and other major cities across the country, taken from a joint study in 2010 by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank.The ""50-State Property Tax Comparison Study,"" which has been done periodically since 1995, examines property taxes across the country in three ways: by comparing taxes in the largest city in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the second-largest cities in Illinois and New York  because Chicago and New York City have such idiosyncratic tax systems (so 53 cities in all); by comparing taxes in the 50 largest cities by population in the country; and by comparing the taxes in a single rural community in each of the 50 states.Providence was considered among the first group of 53 cities. It did indeed rank second for the highest commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit. Des Moines was third, Philadelphia fourth and New York City fifth.According to the study, for a commercial property valued at $1 million and with $200,000 in fixtures, the net property taxes in Providence would be $47,695 a year. The effective tax rate, which factors in statutory exemptions and assessment practices, would be 3.975 percent.The same property in Detroit would pay $48,141 for a rate of 4.012 percent. In contrast, that property in Cheyenne, Wyo., which ranked 53rd in the study, would pay $7,824 under a 0.652-percent rate.Providence is not included in the second group of the 50 largest cities in the country. (With 178,042 people, Rhode Island’s capital ranks 131st, according to the 2010 census.) If it were, it would still be second for commercial property taxes, again behind Detroit.If Providence were included in the third group of rural communities, it would rank second for commercial property taxes, behind Iola, Kan.Providence has moved up the list as its financial crisis has deepened in recent years: in 2007, the city ranked 16th for commercial property taxes. In 2009, it ranked sixth. It moved to second in 2010.So Providence does have the second-highest commercial property taxes in the most recent 50-state study. But although that study is certainly comprehensive, it is not exhaustive. It did not look at every city in the country. We looked for more research.Our first call was to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Joseph Henchman, director of state projects, referred us to a draft report that compared the tax burdens that identical hypothetical corporations would have in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states; it looked at only one city in Rhode Island and other small states.)In that study, which has yet to be released, Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, according to Henchman, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C.""It’s looking like no matter how you do it, Rhode Island is not coming up real good,"" said Henchman.Our rulingChafee said that Providence has the second-highest commercial property tax in the nation, citing a City of  Providence report that cites the Minnesota report. Neither report makes that definitive claim.But the Minnesota report does say Providence is second highest in its comparison of 53 cities. And if Providence were included in comparisons of the nation’s largest cities, it would also rank second.A Tax Foundation study ranks Providence third for commercial property taxes by one measurement, but different ways of comparing tax burdens could account for the difference.It’s possible there are other cities with higher commercial property taxes, but we couldn’t find any.Although Chafee went a step too far in saying definitively that Providence’s commercial property tax is the second-highest in the country, there is ample evidence to support his statement and little that contradicts it.We rate the claim Mostly True.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

The number of cases since 2007, by our count, was 59.Could the state really have investigated and handed out fines in so many more cases each year?Matt Carrothers, a spokesman for the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, sent us numbers outlining how many cases the State Elections Board reviewed in 2009, 2010 and 2011, along with the number of investigations Kemp’s office has opened.The annual totals:-- 208 in 2009-- 234 in 2010-- 205 in 2011Some of the investigations consist of multiple people, so the actual number of people investigated could be higher, Carrothers said.""The numbers that we based that original statement on are not only factual, but the base line,"" he said. ""The real numbers are higher.""A detailed breakdown of each investigation wasn’t available, but the cases reviewed by the State Elections Board are on its website. The board reviewed 102 cases this year, as Carrothers said. The 2010 total we calculated of people who had cases before the board was about the same as what Carrothers told us.

The net gain, then, was 36,400 jobs.In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs of which 14,700 were from the public sectorPrior to that, New Jersey had the most job growth in 2000, with an overall increase of 77,100 jobs.So, last year New Jersey had the highest total employment growth in seven years.When we reached back out to Jones, he said the statement in the ad was referring to private-sector employment, which grew more last year than in 11 years.""There’s been bloated government in Trenton for too long. Governor Christie’s policies are working to trim the fat, while growing private-sector jobs,"" he said.Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J.

""Whereas in 2004 it was sort of the Wild West, 40 percent of the total growth that year was in the public sector.""As we’ve noted in previous rulings, it’s generally wrong to assign full credit or blame for job growth or job losses to specific individuals.

But he didn't say in a September debate that lawmakers should get rid of it.However, Gingrich's record includes some support for Romney's larger point, that the long-time Washington politician has adapted his positions on education and the Education Department.We rate Romney's statement Half True.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-runs-away-ronald/,https://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/campaign-wrap/index.html,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h1979-468&sort=name,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/,http://www.newt.org/solutions/21st-century-learning-system,http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/01/06/15elections_ep.h31.html",,"National,Candidate Biography,Education,States,Mitt Romney",,,,,

Frank Lasee, R-De Pere, arguably has received the least attention among the GOP candidates seeking a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat in 2012.But the 15-year state lawmaker made an attention-grabbing claim about federal health reforms, which he and other Republicans label as ""Obamacare,"" in an opinion piece published Jan. 9, 2012.Writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Lasee referenced a study of President Barack Obama’s initiative on Wisconsin. He said that according to the study, ""nearly 90 percent of people with (health) insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent.""We don’t know whether the study’s prediction will turn out to be accurate.But what about Lasee’s characterization of the study? Do nearly 90 percent of people in Wisconsin who have health insurance face a cost increase of more than 30 percent?'Obamacare' changesFeatured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021Lasee’s campaign for the seat held by retiring Democrat Herb Kohl has been overshadowed by those of his fellow Republicans: former govenor Tommy Thompson, former congressman Mark Neumann and state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.By attacking ""Obamacare,"" Lasee is taking on the landmark health care reform that became law in 2010, although many provisions don’t take effect until 2014. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have explained, the law leaves in place existing insurance systems -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor -- while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. The law also requires almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine, a provision that has been challenged and will result in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law’s constitutionality in June 2012.Lasee is among countless people who have debated how much folks will have to pay for health insurance once Obama’s plan fully takes effect.The study Lasee cited in making his claim was commissioned by the administration of Wisconsin’s previous governor, Democrat Jim Doyle, who was succeeded by Republican Scott Walker in January 2011.Released in July 2011, the study was done by Gorman Actuarial, a Massachusetts firm specializing in health insurance, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist Jonathan Gruber.Lasee's evidenceWhen we asked Lasee’s office for evidence to back his statement about cost, chief of staff Robert Kovach cited a summary of the study produced by the Walker administration -- which opposes the reform law.The summary says 87 percent of people in Wisconsin who buy their own health insurance -- rather than getting it from an employer or the government -- will see their premiums increase an average of 30 percent.But there’s a big problem right off the bat: Lasee said the 30 percent cost increase applies to all Wisconsinites who have health insurance. The summary he cites refers to the much smaller group of people who buy their own insurance.In any case, rather than relying on the summary, let’s go to the study itself.It says that as of 2009, 4 million people in Wisconsin under age 65 had health insurance. That included more than 3 million who got insurance from their employer and only 180,000 -- or just 4 percent -- who bought it on their own.Of that small group, 87 percent will see their premiums increase an average of 41 percent once federal health care reform fully takes effect, the study says.Even at that, as the Journal Sentinel pointed out in its story about the study, the cost estimate isn't an apples-to-apples comparison because, for many people, the higher costs will bring higher benefits. Some people will pay more because they will be able to afford health plans with better benefits; some will be forced to buy more insurance than they want; and those who can afford insurance now but opt not to buy it will be required to buy it.We went back to Kovach, Lasee’s aide, who acknowledged that the figures Lasee cited misquote the study. He said he believes Lasee’s larger point was that most people in Wisconsin with health insurance will pay more for it under federal health care reform. But that remains to be seen.Our conclusionLasee stated that, according to a study of the impact of federal health care reform on Wisconsin, ""nearly 90 percent of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent.""Those figures apply only to the fraction of people who buy their own health insurance, not to all Wisconsinites with insurance. And Lasee admitted he misquoted the study.We rate Lasee’s statement False.","http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&district=1&display=bio,http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/state-wise-to-wait-and-see-fate-of-health-reform-law-543nst9-136987253.html,http://media.jsonline.com/documents/WI-Final-Report-July-18.2011.pdf,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/,http://www.franklasee.com/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/herb-kohl/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tommy-thompson/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mark-neumann/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/jeff-fitzgerald/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-repealing-health-law-sav/,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/us/supreme-court-to-hear-case-challenging-health-law.html?_r=1&ref=global-home,http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-hall/economist-jonathan-gruber-says-state-officials-spun-the-results-of/article_c929f5a6-d054-11e0-ba1d-001cc4c002e0.html?mode=story,http://www.gormanactuarial.com/,http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj/index.htm,http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Summary.pdf,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-to-return-38-million-earmarked-for-health-exchanges-nt3rver-137621263.html,http://www.jsonline.com/business/128570588.html",,"Health Care,Wisconsin,Frank Lasee",,,,,

In fact, it’s a voluntary program.In any case, here are the historical data:For the most recent month with available data -- October 2011 -- roughly 46.2 million people received SNAP benefits. That’s down slightly from September 2011, when 46.3 million people received benefits, but those two months were the highest in history. The trendline shows consistent increases in the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits: 30.8 million in October 2008, 37.7 million in October 2009, and 43.2 million in October 2010.In addition, the average number of people on SNAP every month hit a record high in 2011 -- 44.7 million. It’s risen every year since 2007.We also checked to make sure that this wasn’t influenced by population growth, and it wasn’t. Currently, about 14 percent of the population is on food stamps. In 1994, the highest year for SNAP use prior to the recession that began in December 2007, the rate was 10.5 percent.So Gingrich is correct that food stamp use is at its highest level in both raw numbers and as a percentage of the U.S. population since the program began in 1969.Case closed? Not quite. Gingrich’s talking point implies that this is Obama’s fault.Clearly, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. It’s impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010.On the one hand, SNAP usage has continued to climb almost every month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand.On the other hand, there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The previous high from 1994, for instance, came following a recession that officially ended in mid 1991 -- and that recession was much milder than the most recent one. This makes it harder to divvy up the blame.One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under President George W. Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama.The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency.Our rulingThe number of SNAP beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen in most months of the Obama presidency. But Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama is the root cause. Much of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited combined with a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. But Obama has supported those policies.

Tyler is a former longtime spokesman for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a rival of Romney’s in the GOP presidential primary -- but Winning Our Future is by law unaffiliated with Gingrich’s presidential campaign.Tyler wrote back to us to say, ""We don’t make any claim about how many homes Mitt Romney owns.""But at PolitiFact, we do hold politicians -- and super PACs -- accountable for the claims they make to the public. The speaker may have been using a bit of rhetorical excess, but the filmmakers -- in an ad paid for by the Winning Our Future -- chose to air the claim and not dispute it, so we consider it fair game for fact-checking.We did a nationwide database search of real estate transactions, deeds and tax records. Initially, our search turned up 16 addresses affiliated in recent years with Mitt Romney or his wife, Ann. But further research enabled us to rule out the bulk of these because they either had been sold or because they represented commercial properties rather than residences.We were left with three properties that appear to be residences currently owned by Mitt Romney or his wife:• A home in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent ocean front neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. This property, bought by the couple in 2008 for $12 million and assessed at $8.7 million in 2010, has been the subject of news reports that the Romneys plan to tear down the existing house and undertake a significant expansion. We will address that issue in a separate fact check.• A condominium in Ann Romney’s name in Belmont, Mass., assessed at $773,000.• A home in Wolfeboro, N.H., on Lake Winnipesaukee, assessed at $4.3 million. Ann Romney is listed as the owner of the 2.3-acre property, purchased for $2.5 million in 1997. A second, 6.3-acre property nearby, also in Ann Romney’s name, appears to be a combination boathouse and stable with living quarters. It is assessed at $2.5 million. News reports indicate that the Romneys upgraded their Wolfeboro property with tennis courts and other amenities.The Romney campaign did not comment to PolitiFact on the number of houses the family owns.Our rulingWinning Our Future released a video in which an interviewee said Mitt Romney owns 15 homes.

Jon Huntsman suggested President Barack Obama damaged trust in the executive branch by ignoring a 2010 bipartisan proposal to chop the deficit.Huntsman, a Republican candidate for president, made the claim at an NBC-Facebook debate in Concord, N.H., on Jan. 8, 2012.""When the American people look at the political process play out, they hear all the spinning and all the doctrinaire language, and they still walk away with the belief that they're not being represented in Congress, that there's no trust in the executive branch,"" he said. ""And the Simpson-Bowles bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of Barack Obama, and it lands in the garbage can.""He was referring to a proposal that grew out of Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established in February 2010, and chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former Democratic White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles. In December 2010, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures.We wondered — did Obama discard the policy proposals suggested by the the deficit commission?We've checked similar claims before, and think there's better evidence they landed in a desk file than a round file.Claim: Obama failed 'to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions'New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a speech in September 2011 that Obama failed ""to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission.""Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey rated Christie's claim Mostly False.They found that the president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset but that Obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission. Even the commission’s co-chairs, Simpson and Bowles, said so.""We are encouraged that the president has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report,"" Bowles and Simpson said in an April 13, 2011, press release.Alice Rivlin, a member of the commission and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, told PolitiFact New Jersey she was disappointed that the president didn't endorse the commission's recommendations immediately but agreed that Obama later embraced some of its proposals.A former policy adviser to Clinton said Obama has ""approached the report very carefully.""""He's kept it at arms' length,"" Bill Galston, now a senior fellow at Brookings, told PolitiFact New Jersey. Obama is ""not exactly rejecting it,"" Galston said, but ""not exactly embracing it either.""Claim: Obama 'took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas'In April 2011, John Boehner told ABC News that Obama, ""took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one.""PolitFact rated Boehner's claim False.PolitiFact looked at the commission’s final report, which was released in December 2010; the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which was released in February 2011; and a fact sheet released by the White House following Obama’s budget speech at George Washington University in April 2011.The commission’s report offered no shortage of recommendations for the White House to choose from -- more than 70, in fact. Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama had been included in the bipartisan commission’s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposals either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Here's an abbreviated version of what we found. (For more explanation, visit the original fact-check.)First are two recommendations by the commission that were included in the president’s budget proposal:• Allow the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to increase premiums. • Increase government authority and funding to reduce Medicare fraud.These two items by themselves show Boehner was wrong to say that none of the commission’s recommendations were included — and it was similarly inappropriate for Huntsman to declare the proposal went from Obama's desk in the garbage can.Next, we listed six of the commission’s recommendations that were included in the president’s budget with slight differences.• Eliminate ""in-school subsidies"" for the federal student loan program. • End the reliance on deficit spending to fund the transportation trust fund. • Freeze pay for federal workers and Defense Department civilians.• Overhaul the medical malpractice system. • Reform the corporate tax system. • Increase government efficiency.Finally, the White House ""framework"" on deficit reduction refers very generally to seven of the commission’s recommendations. In several of these examples, the White House proposal offers less detail than the commission’s.• Cut both security and non-security spending. • Implement structural tax reform. • Reform Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism. • Establish a long-term global budget for federal health care spending.• Eliminate state ""gaming"" of Medicaid. • Reduce agricultural subsidies. • Create a mechanism to enforce adherence to debt stabilization.We reached out to Huntsman's campaign for evidence for his claim but didn't hear back the day of the debate.Our rulingHuntsman used a metaphor to describe what happened to the deficit reduction proposal.

Mitt Romney.During a Dec. 29, 2011, interview on NBC’s Today, Savannah Guthrie asked Santorum, ""Should Republicans … today be concerned about this issue of electability should you be the nominee against Barack Obama?""Here’s Santorum’s full response:""Absolutely they should be concerned about the electability. I'm the only one in this race that has a track record of winning elections in tough states. I had a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. And in two statewide elections, you know, running against very strong candidates, I was able to win the state of Pennsylvania, something a Republican hasn't done for president since 1988.""And so if you look at everybody else in the field, no one has ever run as a conservative and been able to attract independents and Democrats to win. I have. And I think that's one of the reasons the people in Iowa are looking us. They say, ‘Wow, this guy's defeated, you know, straight up two Democratic incumbents to win his House seat and -- and Senate seat in very tough districts and in a very tough state.’""There’s a lot to look at here. Let’s go race by race.House electionsIn 1990, Santorum, a 32-year-old lawyer, challenged seven-term Democratic incumbent Doug Walgren. ""Santorum knocked on 25,000 doors, amassed an army of volunteers including many right-to-lifers, attacked Walgren for voting for a pay raise seven times and for living in the Washington suburbs,"" according to the Almanac of American Politics. Despite being outspent, $717,000 to $251,000, Santorum won, 51 percent to 49 percent.This district leaned Democratic, but after the 1990 Census, redistricting made it even more so. Yet Santorum won his 1992 re-election bid easily, defeating a Democratic state senator, 61 to 38 percent.It’s worth noting that in this district -- and much of western Pennsylvania -- there are lots of voters who register as Democrats but who are substantially more conservative than the party label would suggest. Many are ethnic and blue-collar Democrats who are socially conservative, particularly on abortion. So as a Catholic politician staunchly opposed to abortion, Santorum was well positioned to win support from voters who were traditionally Democratic but whose leanings on social issues more closely mirrored those of the GOP. ""Those voters may be Democrats, but they are conservative, anti-communist (this still mattered in the 1980s and early 1990s), Catholic, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-manufacturing, and not-so pro-environment. Santorum fit perfectly,"" said David Patti, who heads the Pennsylvania Business Council and who worked in the Ronald Reagan campaign in Pittsburgh in 1984So Santorum’s claim needs a bit of an asterisk. Still, he has a point. Under the district lines first used in 1992, Democratic candidates for president won easily -- Bill Clinton won, 52 to 39 percent, in 1996, and Al Gore won, 57 to 41 percent, in 2000. Clearly, then, lots of voters in the district were comfortable voting for Santorum, Clinton and Gore.1994 Senate raceIn 1994, Santorum challenged liberal Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford, who had been elected in a 1991 special election.In 1991, Wofford -- running against a popular former Republican governor, Richard Thornburgh -- had won 61 percent of the vote in metropolitan Pittsburgh. But against Santorum, who hailed from the area, Wofford won metro Pittsburgh by only a 50 to 47 percent margin. This significant underperformance suggests that Santorum remained popular in his home region, which includes many Democrats. (Statewide, Santorum won narrowly, 49 to 47 percent.)Here, too, it’s worth noting an asterisk: 1994 was the year of a Republican congressional landslide. This may not have greatly helped Santorum’s standing among Democrats, but his anti-incumbent status probably boosted his appeal among independents.The best way to measure Santorum’s appeal for Democrats and independents in 1994 is through exit polls, in which pollsters gather data from voters exiting polling places on Election Day. However, when we contacted the main archive for exit polls -- the University of Connecticut’s Roper Center -- they told us that the statewide data was not in an easily usable form for 1994.2000 Senate raceOf Santorum’s three Senate races, 2000 is the only one conducted in what might be called a ""neutral"" political environment -- neither the Republican rout of 1994, nor the Democratic tsunami of 2006. In 2000, by contrast, the presidential race ended in a virtual tie. For this reason, it may be the best test of Santorum’s argument that he’s ""been able to attract independents and Democrats.""In 2000, Santorum’s strong conservatism initially made him look vulnerable for voters in a swing state. But in the general election, he faced Rep. Ron Klink, who had emerged from a multi-candidate Democratic primary with little money and not much of a statewide profile. Klink, like many western Pennsylvania Democrats, was anti-abortion and pro-gun, lessening his appeal for many fellow Democrats and making it hard for him to replenish his treasury. Ultimately, Santorum outspent Klink 3-to-1 and won a second term, 52 to 46 percent.Fortunately, the Roper Center does have a breakdown of the 2000 Pennsylvania exit poll.It shows that self-identified Democratic voters split their votes in the Senate race as follows: 80 percent for Klink, 18 percent for Santorum. Among self-identified independents, the breakdown was 55 percent for Santorum, 41 percent for Klink.So Santorum’s record of Democratic support in his home district and regionally largely didn’t carry over to the statewide Senate race of 2000. He lost Democrats statewide by a 4-to-1 margin.However, he has a point that he was able to win independent votes. Against Klink, he won a clear majority of independents in 2000.2006 Senate raceIn 2006, Democrats were buoyed by voter fatigue with President George W. Bush. Santorum faced a strong candidate -- Robert Casey, a former Pennsylvania auditor general and state treasurer who was the son of a popular former governor. In fact, the incumbent was considered an underdog for most, if not all, of the campaign.In a year when the Democrats took over the House and Senate, Santorum was trounced, as Casey won, 59 to 41 percent.The exit polls found that Democrats backed Casey over Santorum, 93 percent to 7 percent. Even independents abandoned Santorum, backing Casey by a 72 to 28 percent margin.So whatever juice Santorum had among either group of voters essentially vanished in the Democratic wave election of 2006.Our rulingWe come to a mixed verdict on Santorum’s claim that he has ""been able to attract independents and Democrats to win"" elections in Pennsylvania.Santorum can point to solid evidence that he won over Democrats and independents in his two House races and in his wave-aided 1994 Senate election. However, since many of the conservative Democrats, including those in his home district, have either left the Democratic Party or voted increasingly for Republicans over the last quarter century, it’s not clear how relevant this fact is in bolstering the case that Santorum can win votes from disaffected Obama Democrats in 2012.Meanwhile, Santorum lost badly statewide among Democrats in 2000 and 2006, and while he won independents in 2000, he lost them by a large margin in the Democratic wave of 2006. If anything, the general trend is that Santorum has done less well among Democrats and independents over time, and as he’s run for bigger political offices.

Scott Walker are attacking what they view as serious side effects from his fiscal medicine.A TV ad by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee uses interview clips to hammer Walker for backing business tax breaks while reducing state support for local schools.The speakers -- unidentified by name or position, but described by the group as teachers, parents or grandparents -- make claims about school staffing cuts and larger class sizes.  Their claims are presented as more than random anecdotes; one source listed on the screen is a report issued by the state Department of Public Instruction, which oversees public education in Wisconsin.A few of the statements caught our attention -- and that of many readers:""My daughter has not enough tables and chairs in her room and she has kids sitting on the floor,"" a man says, sitting with a woman and two young girls in a restaurant. A citation flashes on the screen: the state budget bill.Then a young man standing outside says: ""Forty-seven in a room, they don’t get much attention."" An onscreen graphic reads, ""Classes are overcrowded,"" and cites the aforementioned report issued by the Department of Public Instruction -- a widely publicized report summarizing a statewide survey of schools following the budget cuts.Together, they essentially make the same point: Walker’s school-aid cuts were so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom.Is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right?First, viewers may have seen slightly different versions of the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad -- at least three were produced and they all vary a bit. And we can’t show them to you here: The group does not post its ads online but released a script.We’ll test the specific anecdotes but also look at the statewide situation.The group argues the ad does not suggest that the anecdotes are representative of the situation statewide, but we disagree.The ""not enough chairs"" anecdote is presented as one family’s experience, but the ""47 in a room"" line is presented as a broad statement of fact, bolstered by the ""classes are overcrowded"" tagline and citation of a statewide survey as proof.And the GWC is paying for the ad, so it is responsible for the message that the individuals are conveying.When asked for backup, the group’s leader, Michelle McGrorty, cited the statewide survey published in November by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators in conjunction with the state DPI, which is independent of the governor’s office.Previously, we rated two claims from that survey.We found False a statement by Walker that ""the overwhelming number"" of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-’13 state budget. And we also rated False a claim by the state’s largest teachers’ union that state budget cuts for schools    resulted in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs.Let’s study up.Both sides have used the survey to argue their case on class sizes. The survey covered most schools, so it has value. At the same time, its conclusions have to be treated with caution because a district is counted as having higher class sizes even if only one grade was affected.There is no doubt that at least one class size went up in a significant number of cases.In elementary school, 42 percent of districts reported at least one class size increased. The middle school and high school data was more specific; 21 percent to 24 percent of core subject-area classes saw an increase in class sizes.Cutbacks in teaching staff in the wake of the state aid cuts played a role in increased class sizes, the survey found. Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers.That’s what we know.What we don’t know -- and what the GWC cannot establish from the report  -- is the size of the classes to bolster its ""overcrowding"" view.The survey did not ask how many kids were in classrooms, or how many more students were added to classrooms. It simply asked whether any class sizes had increased. Nowhere in its analysis of the survey does DPI describe the resulting class sizes as ""overcrowded.""According to WASDA and DPI officials, the survey did not attempt to get at whether school officials viewed their classes as overcrowded -- in part because it is a subjective term.The survey does not document any shortage of desks or chairs in classrooms either.Asked about the survey, McGrorty said the findings ""definitely"" mean there will be some overcrowding.But we contacted DPI and WASDA and another trade association and found no one claiming overcrowding or any specific increase in class size averages.WASDA has long tracked increased class sizes -- and says they are not a new phenomenon. Twenty years of state limits on school taxation have driven up class sizes for years, said Miles Turner, executive director of the group. He and others noted particularly that ""specials"" classes such as art and music have been combined as districts have laid off some of those teachers.Another statewide association, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said class size increase have not risen to ""troublesome"" levels.Judging whether a class is overcrowded depends on the grade level, the type of students, the subject and other factors, Turner and several school superintendents and administrators told us.We have none of that information from the ad.So the claim has plenty of problems.That leaves us with fact checking the specific anecdotes, but Greater Wisconsin -- which is funded by labor, Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors -- refuses to name the people or even cite the districts involved.McGrorty told us the group is concerned about potential harassment or threats of violence against the speakers.She also said the group was told that a school had to combine two classrooms because a teacher was laid off, and it lacked enough chairs. In the claims of classes increasing to 47, McGrorty contends it was a high school English class.We were not able to identify the districts.The statewide teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said it couldn’t identify them either, but said it had received reports from members about increased class sizes.We also contacted schools in Milwaukee and Janesville, two districts hit hardest by budget cuts because they had teachers’ contracts in place and could not take advantage of health insurance and pension savings that Walker’s budget provided.Janesville told us class sizes were limited to 30 for most grades by school board policy. The board in December 2011 bumped that up to 32. A district spokesman could cite no overcrowding.In Milwaukee, the president of the teachers union, Robert Peterson, told us no survey had been done there but he was receiving numerous reports of larger class sizes -- more than 40 in some.District spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin concurred in part: Class sizes vary from 17 to 41 depending on the type of class and students. But she said no comparable data was available for the year before. Class sizes did jump in schools that lost special funding due to budget cuts, she said.We heard that a gym class at Burroughs Middle School in Milwaukee had almost 50 kids. True, St. Aubin said, but two aides assist the teacher.We read a comment on a Fox Valley TV news story, apparently posted by a teacher, that claimed she lacked enough chairs for a kindergarten class. The district in question was Oshkosh, best we could tell. An official there said the classes had enough chairs; the teacher who apparently posted the comment did not return calls.Our conclusionIn trying to show that Walker’s budget has caused school overcrowding, the Greater Wisconsin Committee misuses a survey of schools, cloaks its anecdotes in anonymity and provides no verification of its assertions.In our view, the ad’s message is that school crowding is common and dramatic, assertions not backed up by key school officials or the research cited. Class sizes have increased, and Walker’s budget is partly responsible, but that trend began before Walker, and other factors play in.In any case, that is not the same as ""overcrowding"" -- a description not even school and union officials are using.We may revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but these claims -- as presented -- are thin and misleading.We rate the claim False.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021","http://media.jsonline.com/documents/GWC.pdf,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/27/scott-walker/walker-says-overwhelming-number-wisconsin-school-d/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/28/wisconsin-education-association-council/weac-says-state-budget-cuts-led-nearly-4000-educat/,http://media.jsonline.com/documents/GWC+statement.docx,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/",,"Education,State Budget,Wisconsin,Greater Wisconsin Committee",,,,,

Mitt Romney ""just yesterday said you're an unreliable conservative. Now, obviously, he's your opponent. … But even Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said today he respects you greatly, but he openly questioned whether you had the discipline and focus to be president.""Gingrich responded, ""Well, those are two different questions. .... I have a 90 percent American Conservative Union voting record for 20 years. I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt. Pretty conservative. … I think on the conservative thing, it's sort of laughable to suggest that somebody who campaigned with Ronald Reagan and with Jack Kemp and has had a 30-year record of conservatism, is somehow not a conservative?""The claim that Gingrich ""balanced the budget for four straight years (and) paid off $405 billion in debt"" sounded familiar. It turns out that we originally fact-checked it when Gingrich made it on May 11, 2011, when he released a video to launch his presidential campaign.In that video, he said, ""for four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt."" With soft music in the background, Gingrich said with a smile, ""We’ve done it before. We can do it again.""Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.First, the balanced budget.The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.But that’s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House.Now for Gingrich’s comments about the debt.The national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That’s an increase, not a decrease.If you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion.A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, as in this case, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified.With this statement, even if Gingrich’s numbers had been correct, his language suggested that he deserved sole credit for the achievement, when in fact it was a collective accomplishment with a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. That further downgrades the accuracy of his claim.Our rulingGingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years. As for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich’s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion. We rate Gingrich’s claim False. Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/322a0d22-442b-41c1-9415-76fe52d38a5e","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-inaccurate-budget-debt-claims-video-/,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/322a0d22-442b-41c1-9415-76fe52d38a5e",,"National,Deficit,Federal Budget,History,Newt Gingrich",,,,,

With experts agreeing he was a national leader in that area, Thompson’s claim earned a True from our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Reforms similar to those made in Wisconsin were later adopted at the federal level under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who had previously made welfare changes as governor of Arkansas.But reforming welfare isn’t the same as ending it.As Thompson tries to burnish his conservative credentials against two other candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012, let’s step back in time.Before becoming President George W. Bush’s health and human services secretary in 2001, Thompson served for 14 years as Wisconsin’s governor. One of his signature accomplishments was ""Wisconsin Works -- W2,"" a measure he signed in to law in 1996.Thompson’s Senate campaign spokesman, Darrin Schmitz, cited W-2 as the primary evidence to back Thompson’s claim.A booklet on W-2 produced by the Thompson administration at the time hailed the law as ""the end of welfare,"" saying it eliminated ""automatic welfare checks"" provided by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.For decades, AFDC’s cash entitlement to low-income families, which sometimes lasted for many years, was synonymous with ""welfare"" in America.AFDC included virtually no work requirements, but W-2 not only requires recipients to work, or engage in work-related activity such as training, it puts a five-year limit on how long they can be in the program.There are several types of W-2 assistance. Some recipients, for example, work in private-sector ""trial jobs"" that pay at least minimum wage and are intended to become permanent, while others earn up to $673 per month working in community service jobs. In October 2011, the number of people in W-2, which is budgeted to cost $626 million in state and federal funds in 2010-2011, was nearly 16,000 -- up 15 percent from a year earlier.So, Thompson replaced the AFDC entitlement with the work-required W-2 -- but does that mean he ended welfare, period?The definition of welfare is key.Thompson ""had a leading role in ending welfare as we previously knew it,"" said Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal think tank. ""Whether he eliminated welfare altogether is a matter of semantics.  If by welfare, one means an entitlement program that doesn’t require work, then I think one can say that (Thompson) played a leading role in the effort to eliminate welfare.  If one uses a more expansive definition, equating welfare with public assistance generally or with any form of cash assistance, then it’s not accurate to say it was eliminated.""  New York University professor of politics Lawrence Mead, who has done a number of studies on W-2, agreed.""If welfare means the old system, then he’s right, he did indeed abolish it,"" Mead said of Thompson, noting Wisconsin was the first state to create an ""all-work-based"" aid system.But ""it’s not true in a more literal sense,"" Mead said, because other forms of welfare -- such as food stamps -- still exist.For instance, in October 2011, more than 800,000 low-income Wisconsin adults and children participated in FoodShare, Wisconsin’s version of what used to be known as the food stamps program.Moreover, despite its strict work requirements, W-2 arguably has its own welfare components. For example, the custodial parent of an infant who is 12 weeks old or less receives $673 per month and is not required to work. That is, to be sure, a small group and a limited time.Our conclusionThompson declared that as governor, ""we ended welfare."" His W-2 program didn’t eliminate every program that might be considered a handout. But it did end the entitlement program most commonly known as welfare, replacing it with one that requires nearly all recipients to work for their benefits.We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly True.","https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tommy-thompson/,http://www.620wtmj.com/blogs/charliesykes/134794278.html,https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2263552358,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/01/tommy-thompson/thompson-was-a-leader-in-welfare-reform/,http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/09/thompson-announ.php,http://www.governing.com/topics/mgmt/Taking-Stock.html,http://dcf.wi.gov/w2/wisworks.htm,http://www.persuasionpartners.com/darrin.html,http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&CISOPTR=49223&CISOSHOW=49207,https://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/afdc/baseline/1history.pdf,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2011/46_W-2%20and%20other%20economic%20support%20programs.pdf,http://dcf.wisconsin.gov/researchandstatistics/rsdata/pdf/critindicators2011_10.pdf,http://www.wccf.org/about_staff.php,http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/LawrenceMMead,http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/pdf/ataglance/2011/Ataglance201110.pdf,http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/,http://dcf.wi.gov/w2/wisworks.htm",,"Welfare,Wisconsin,Tommy Thompson",,,,,

But that's more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history,"" Lautenberg said in an article on nola.com, the online home of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.Can it be that after 40 years of operation the money spent on Amtrak didn’t even equal one year of federal highway spending?

Highway spending generally increases a small amount each year for inflation, he said.By comparison, Caley Gray, Lautenberg’s communications director, said Congress has spent $37.9 billion on Amtrak from Fiscal Year 1971 to Fiscal Year 2011, according to Amtrak.That’s a bit more than Amtrak’s total, but it supports Lautenberg’s statement.""In the forty years of Amtrak’s existence, the Federal government has invested a total of $36 billion in the Amtrak system – a figure that represents both operating and capital funding,"" Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said in Amtrak’s General and Legislative Annual Report to Senate President Joseph Biden Jr. and House Speaker John Boehner. Amtrak’s Comprehensive Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 was included with the report dated Feb. 7.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) supporting Amtrak’s $2.2 billion funding request for Fiscal Year 2012. Murray is chairman and Collins is a ranking member on the Appropriations Committee for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.

Bush. We wondered: Did the Energy Department's loan guarantee program have Bush's support?Solyndra, which manufactured unique solar panels based on cylindrical cells that didn't require silicon, was once a burgeoning clean energy superstar, attracting more than $1 billion from private investors. In 2009, the Obama administration approved a $535 million loan guarantee that helped the company build a new factory in Fremont, Calif. It became a poster child for the president's stimulus efforts. But in August 2011, the factory suddenly closed, and by September the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The company's failure prompted an FBI raid, a congressional investigation and claims of ""crony capitalism"" by critics of the administration, because a major Solyndra investor was connected to a billionaire who had raised campaign cash for President Barack Obama. (We explained that connection when we rated a recent political ad that said Obama used taxpayer money ""to help his friends at Solyndra."" We found the ad's claim Mostly False.)Meanwhile, the loan guarantee program itself has attracted greater scrutiny.On Oct. 30, 2011, Meet the Press host David Gregory brought up Solyndra in an interview with Plouffe, asking if taxpayers had been ripped off. Plouffe defended the administration's efforts to ""win the clean energy race."" Here's the part of the exchange we're checking:Gregory: ""Should government be playing venture capitalist to try to prop these industries up?""Plouffe: ""Well, we believe this loan program is very important. By the way, it was a program that was supported by President Bush. So there's been support in both parties. Many of the members of Congress who offered criticism themselves were lobbying for funds for companies like this.""Program dates back to 2005The Energy Department's loan guarantee program was created as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by Bush.In his signing speech, Bush lauded the bill's support for clean technology, though he didn't specifically mention the loan guarantees.The loan guarantees were designed to ""support innovative clean energy technologies that are typically unable to obtain conventional private financing due to high technology risks.""Republicans, including Bush, emphasized the program's benefits for nuclear energy and biofuels. The president touted the new energy law in his 2007 State of the Union address. His energy secretary, Samuel Bodman, regularly mentioned the loan guarantees in speeches on renewable energy. The Energy Department issued its final rules for the program in 2007, along with a list of 16 companies that made the cut for to apply for its first round of awards, and Solyndra was among them.House Republicans investigating Solyndra have claimed that the Bush administration ultimately rejected the Solyndra loan, but that's not quite the case. Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and news media point out that Bush energy officials wanted to get the loan closed on their way out the door — it was listed as the first of their ""three highest priorities through January 15."" (Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009.) But the Energy Department's credit committee held things up for more analysis. ""The number of issues unresolved makes a recommendation for approval premature at this time. Therefore, the committee, without prejudice, remands the project to the LGPO [Loan Guarantee Program Office] for further development of information,"" the committee said.It noted Solyndra's project ""appears to have merit."" But the clock had run out.That didn't keep Bush from touting the loan guarantee program on his way out of office. On Jan. 6, 2009, in remarks on conservation and the environment from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, he said, ""We dedicated more than $18 billion to developing clean and efficient technologies like biofuels, advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, solar and wind power, and clean, safe nuclear power. We're providing more than $40 billion in loan guarantees to put these technologies to use.""Ultimately, the Bush administration program didn't finalize a single loan guarantee.Featured Fact-checkStudents for Trumpstated on February 16, 2021 in a Tweet“Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 23, 2021Stimulus expands old programWhile the loan guarantee program originated under Bush, it grew under Obama.Solyndra applied for help under Section 1703 of Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The federal stimulus bill signed by Obama expanded Title XVII by adding Section 1705. The new program was temporary, designed to boost certain types of clean energy projects that could start construction by Sept. 20, 2011. The new section was an even better deal for winning projects, because taxpayers covered the ""credit subsidy costs"" that under Bush businesses had to pay themselves. Solyndra's loan guarantee was awarded under Section 1705.Is it fair to say the loan guarantee program ""was supported by President Bush"" when it was updated under Obama? FactCheck.org took issue with a similar statement by Obama — that the loan guarantee program predated him — pointing out that the Bush administration created 1703, while Solyndra won funding under 1705.But the Energy Department says pretty clearly that ""Section 1703 and Section 1705 fall under the LGP (loan guarantee program)."" We think Bush's broad support for loan guarantees for high-risk clean energy provides reasonable support for Plouffe's statement — especially since the Bush administration program also found merit in Solyndra's project.Our rulingPlouffe said that the loan guarantee program that awarded half a billion dollars in guarantees to Solyndra ""was supported by President Bush."" The program was created on Bush's watch by a law he signed and promoted. The program grew under the Obama administration, which ultimately awarded Solyndra's loan guarantee under a new section of the law created by the stimulus. The Bush administration, though, promoted the loan guarantee program, and Bush himself touted it on his way out of office. There's also evidence his administration specifically prioritized Solyndra's project.

492,,,,barely-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/nov/10/frank-ortis/pembroke-pines-vote-southwest-ranches/,The city of Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in a plan to build a detention center in Southwest Ranches.,,politifact,,"Southwest Ranches is a tiny wealthy suburban enclave in western Broward County where some residents still ride horses, and the town once fought a street light proposal because residents didn't want the lights to interfere with their view of the stars.Now the rural-suburban oasis has become embroiled in controversy because of a longtime plan to build a jail. The town's plan to have a jail on the site had been publicly discussed for many years. But an uproar erupted in 2011, when U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement announced that it had tentatively selected the Southwest Ranches site for an immigration detention facility. The Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition, a pro-immigration group that opposes the jail, robo-called nearby residents.U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents the area, wrote a letter of support for the project in April 2011, along with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But as the controversy grew, Wasserman Schultz later wrote a letter to the town's mayor urging the town to hold a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), and that meeting occurred Nov. 5.Hundreds of residents gathered at a library to voice their concern. The Miami Herald described the meeting as a circus-like atmosphere -- replete with plenty of roving sheriff's deputies and a ""First Amendment"" area. The angry crowd was clearly against the project, and Mayor Frank Ortis, from neighboring Pembroke Pines, drew the biggest applause, the Miami Herald wrote.Watch Ortis on the city's video of the meeting starting around minute 76:""Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting,"" Ortis said. ""Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first."" (The Herald's article also included most of that quote.)Ortis' passionate speech prompted someone at the meeting to suggest ""Frank Ortis for governor.""Ortis, first elected as a commissioner in 1996 and mayor in 2004, ingratiated himself with the angry opponents of the prison. But was he correct to state that Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in the project?Jail in works since 1990sFirst, some background on the immigration detention facility.A jail has been in the works in the area for decades. In 1991, Broward County commissioners agreed to buy nearly 70 acres in unincorporated southwest Broward for a future 4,000-bed county jail, which at the time would have been the nation's fifth-largest jailhouse, the Sun-Sentinel reported then. A jail overcrowding crisis prompted the county to buy the site, but in lieu of developing it the county expanded a jail facility in Pompano Beach instead.In 1998 Corrections Corporation of America, called CCA, bought an adjacent 24-acre site east of U.S. 27 between Sheridan Street and Stirling Road. CCA bought the land in response to a request for proposals from then-Sheriff Ron Cochran for a county jail for women, said Steve Owen, a CCA spokesman. Cochran died in 1997, and the next sheriff, Ken Jenne, cancelled seeking proposals. But CCA went ahead, believing that another government entity would want to send inmates there if it built a jail.In 2000, Southwest Ranches incorporated as a town, and in 2005 the town signed a deal with CCA to build the facility with the intention that the customer would be the federal government.CCA plans to build a facility for up to 1,500 beds, Owen told PolitiFact in an e-mail. (Some articles and documents cite higher figures, but Owen said an application to increase the number was withdrawn when ICE sought a smaller facility.)The details with ICE are still being worked out but once construction begins, it could be up and running in about 18 months. Once the prison is built and fully occupied, the town stands to earn than $1 million a year in taxes and fees.Pines commission voted multiple times about the prisonWhile Southwest Ranches has been in the driver's seat here -- the town was responsible for approving the agreement with CCA, for example -- Pembroke Pines has played a role. Let's look at the votes that Pines has taken related to the prison project while Ortis has been mayor. For a list of the votes by the Pembroke Pines Commission, we turned to an email sent by Pembroke Pines City Manager Charlie Dodge to commissioners Oct. 5, and we then we turned to the city's minutes when available to verify the votes. Here is a summary of some of the key votes:• Sept. 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, voted unanimously to notify Broward County that it objected to the 1,500-bed jail. But at the time, the town and city were embroiled in some unrelated spats about road lights and barricades the town had set up blocking drivers from Pines from traveling on certain Ranches roads. Pines' objection to the prison appeared to be more of a bargaining chip, because a few months later the city agreed to not fight the prison and the two municipalities reached an agreement on the roads.• December 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved an agreement with Ranches that included language that stated, ""The CITY shall not interfere with Corrections Corporation of America, or its successors or assigns, development and/or operation of the jail facility, or with the TOWN’S Agreement with Corrections Corporation of America concerning development of same.""• June 27, 2011: The commission, along with Ortis, approved an agreement with the town to provide emergency medical and fire protection in exchange for $2.5 million annually starting Oct. 1. The agreement includes a section that states that ""CITY acknowledges that it has sufficient capacity to deliver emergency medical protection and fire prevention services to the TOWN’s future 2,500 bed penal institution/deportation facility, located on property currently owned by the Corrections Corporation of America...."" The agreement also states that it has capacity to provide water and sewer. The vote, which included Ortis, was unanimous.• Aug. 17, 2011: Commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved a motion to begin providing fire service one month earlier than planned: Sept. 1, 2011. (The minutes were not available but city clerk Judy Neugent provided us with a draft copy.)Pines attorney cautions city against trying to stop service to jail siteAfter opposition sparked a fury, Pembroke Pines city commissioners asked their attorney, Sam Goren, to explain if the city had to provide water and sewer to the jail facility after they had already voted to do so. Goren's conclusion: once the city agreed to provide water and sewer it couldn't back away -- the city could face a breach of contract. And, as the Pines lawyers wrote in a follow-up memo Sept. 21, the city already provides water and sewer to the area including to an adjacent women's prison. ""The City’s denial of service to one facility while providing service to a similar adjacent facility may place the City in a legally tenuous position,"" said Goren in the memo.Broward County also played a role in paving the way for the prison. Based on county staff's recommendations, the county commission voted to amend the plat note on Dec. 13, 2005. The amendment changed the plat note from industrial use to a 1,500-bed correctional facility.Ortis respondsWe asked Ortis why he told the crowd ""we don't have a vote in it.""Ortis stood by his comments at the meeting and explained that the city of Pembroke Pines doesn't get a vote on whether the jail facility should be built.""It is a Southwest Ranches issue with CCA. They cut the deal, they voted for it, this project was Southwest Ranches. They signed it. We had no signature to it. We don't have a vote in the entity itself. ... We never had a vote to say yea or nay to it,"" he said.Pembroke Pines did vote to provide fire, water and sewer to the detention center, Ortis said, adding that the city already provides services to a nearby women's prison.""We had a 5-0 (vote) to do that,"" he said. ""In my opinion, the five of us never thought that was a problem. ... Nobody objected to it, no one in the audience was objecting to it.""Ortis said he doesn't think the detention facility belongs at that site, but that the decision rested with Southwest Ranches -- not Pines.Our rulingOrtis told the crowd of jail opponents: ""Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting,"" Ortis said. ""Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first."" Ortis' comments could have left protesters with the impression that as Pines mayor he didn't get to vote on the project. There is a kernel of a fact here: it was Southwest Ranches -- not Pembroke Pines -- that penned the deal with the prison operator, and Pines didn't get an up or down vote on whether the facility should be built. But it's not as if Pines has been in the dark here. Ortis, along with the rest of the commission, voted to provide services to the prison in 2011.

Let’s pop the hood.First, a bit of history.Over several decades, it’s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government.How much tougher?In a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that ""so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception.""""Justice,"" wrote Prosser, ""has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit.""Generally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That’s because of state laws and court rulings.A notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state ""highway defects"" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury.The bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the ""automatic"" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt.Here’s what’s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don’t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes.They don’t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law.Notably, the law creates a ""right to recover"" damages from government.Many of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that’s how strong the law is.If the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway ""reasonably safe for public travel,"" according to jury instructions in place since 1974.""With winter conditions, it’s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day,"" said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work.He’s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state’s highest courts.The money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn’t include all counties, or other municipalities.Let’s turn back to the statement.Asked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill.The bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that.So would that mean citizens could ""no longer sue"" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed?They couldn’t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed.The two sides also agree localities’ legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs.The bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant’s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges.What about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads?Jacobs, of the trial lawyers’ group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute.""What good is a right without a remedy?"" Jacobs asked.Even the counties’ attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone.The Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: ""Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges"" if the bill passed.But in its public news release, the group’s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required.Phillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: ""The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county."" And for towns, 82.03: ""The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction.""So the locals still would have the obligation to repair.Let’s patch this up and move on.A trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to ""make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law."" It continued: ""Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages.""The bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen.But the group’s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required.We rate this claim False.","http://www.wisjustice.org/,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/14/robert-kraig/health-care-advocate-says-wisconsin-bill-would-giv/,http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=251740,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/AB180hst.html,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/AB180hst.html,http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=37884",,"County Government,Legal Issues,Wisconsin,Wisconsin Association for Justice",,,,,

At the time, the state was one of only two that did not allow people to carry concealed weapons.But folks on both sides of the expressed concerns while awaiting detailed rules on how to get a permit.  The law takes effect Nov. 1, 2011.The NRA was upset at rumors that Wisconsin’s Department of Justice would require live-fire training and mandate at least four hours of safety instruction overall. Meanwhile, critics feared that online video courses might be deemed enough to get a permit.Some of those rumors were unfounded -- permit applicants need not fire a gun (as in Minnesota), and training must be face-to-face with a certified instructor. The four-hour length was approved, though, in the emergency rulesissued by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.Nevertheless, despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates, Wisconsin’s overall law is still in the Top 10 for ease of access to permits, according to Nik Clark, head of Wisconsin Carry Inc., a nonprofit gun-rights organization.Something little discussed in the back-and-forth was the fact that applicants can get permits even if their training was years ago.And that’s where the National Rifle Association comes in. The NRA remains unhappy about an issue related to proving an applicant has received past training.In a lobbying alert to its members on Oct.15, 2011, the group’s legislative arm said the state Justice Department overstepped by requiring too much information on the certificates needed as proof of firearms safety training.""No training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands,"" the NRA alert said. ""This renders all existing certificates insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.  DOJ could have easily established a system that would have allowed existing training certificates to be submitted while ensuring that the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met.""The NRA contends some would-be applicants will be discouraged, or will not be able to track down their instructors to get the required proof (for instance, if an instructor died or moved away). It argues in those cases applicants will have to get retrained because of DOJ’s ""demands.""What are those demands, and are they unique to the Wisconsin rules?The NRA could not provide a state-by-state comparison to back up its claim, so we did a brief survey of states based on governmental and private research. We also interviewed firearms safety trainers.So let’s get armed with some facts.We will not focus on what proof is needed in the case of military, law enforcement or security firearms training, or hunter education courses. The dispute is over proof of training run by groups such as the NRA and other state and national organizations.In that case, the DOJ rules require: Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021A signed statement from the instructor confirming graduation from a course that meets Wisconsin’s general requirements (no specific curriculum is mandated as in some states).The name, address and phone number of the instructor or organization, the name of the course and where and when it was held.The name of the organization that certified the instructor.The length of the course.Based on our check of permit rules around the country, it’s not hard to find states that require some of the same things Wisconsin requires.We learned of certificates of training that required confirmation of the course length (Missouri); the instructor’s name and signature (Michigan, Florida, Minnesota); and a statement attesting to the course meeting state law (Michigan) -- the same things Wisconsin requires.And it’s not hard to find states that seek similar items -- Utah requires instructors to stamp the application, for instance.On the other hand, we could find no state that required all of what Wisconsin is seeking. The instructor contact information, in particular, is unusual on the graduation certificate. Some states -- not including Wisconsin -- directly certify instructors and their courses, giving them access to the same information.""You’re on your own over there,"" said Gary Shade, of Shade’s Landing, a personal protection and firearms training company in Apple Valley, Minnesota.In addition to Shade, we spoke with Bill Schmitz, of BDJ, Ltd. in Redgranite, Wis.; Tim Grant, of American Association of Certified Firearms Instructors; and Michael Bender of the Personal Protection Academy in Madison. All said they would have to re-do their certificates because of the Wisconsin rules.Some complained about it; others said it was no big deal.The proof requirements directly affect NRA trainers, who along with instructors from other organizations will have to re-work and re-issue their graduation certificates to meet the specific Wisconsin rules, our research found.This summer, after the law passed but before Van Hollen’s rule came out in October, some people jumped the gun and got trained with less than four hours of instruction or got trained through online courses, according to our interviews with several training companies.Others got enough training but were handed certificates that don’t include all the required information. There is time and expense involved for trainees and instructors in going back at this.Van Hollen says the rules are reasonable and an anti-fraud move.""The DOJ’s requirements for training certificates allow instructors to verify that the permit applicant named on the certificate actually took the course,"" DOJ spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. ""Given the Legislature required ‘proof’ of training, it only makes sense to have the instructor sign the document.""Brueck said the course location verifies the training was face to face.A final point:We found that evaluating the NRA assertion that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands"" is a matter of how you read the statement.Does the group mean nobody else asks for ""any"" of the information Wisconsin does, or that, taken as a whole, no other state seeks all of what we do? NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was the latter.Our conclusionThe NRA claimed that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands.""We found elements in common with what other states require, as well as some that appear to be unique to Wisconsin’s rules on certificates. We think it’s reasonable to interpret the NRA claim as meaning no other state asks for as much as we do on the certificate, so that part of the statement is basically accurate with some clarification.The group also said the DOJ rules render all existing graduation certificates ""insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.""There’s ample evidence that is true for courses run by organizations such as the NRA. The NRA’s overall point is a technical one, but requires some clarification.We rate it Mostly True.","http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/125235719.html,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/125235719.html,http://www.wisconsinshooters.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2040&sid=e12c6b39aa7ebdf4e37bc8e2dc42bc72,http://www.wisconsinshooters.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2040&sid=e12c6b39aa7ebdf4e37bc8e2dc42bc72,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/35,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/35,http://www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/October11/1005/1005nra.pdf,http://www.doj.wi.gov/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/combined-rules17-18-1713-20111020.pdf,http://www.doj.wi.gov/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/combined-rules17-18-1713-20111020.pdf,http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#,http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#,http://www.doj.state.wi.us/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/certificate-public-model-20111018.doc,http://www.doj.state.wi.us/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/certificate-public-model-20111018.doc,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/,http://www.shadeslanding.com/,http://www.bdj-ltd.com/classes.htm,http://www.aacfi.com/,http://www.ppa-wi.com/,http://www.ppa-wi.com/",,"Government Regulation,Guns,Wisconsin,National Rifle Association",,,,,

Paul used his turn to attack Cain.The former Godfather’s Pizza CEO ""belittled"" him and his followers, who want the Federal Reserve to undergo a major audit, Paul said.""You said -- you've used pretty strong terms -- that we were ignorant and that we didn't know what we were doing, and therefore there is no need for an audit anyway because if you had one you're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything about the Fed,"" Paul said during the Oct. 11 debate at Dartmouth College.""I did not call you or any of your people ‘ignorant,"" Cain fired back. ""I don't know where that came from.""Did too, Paul shot back: ""I’ll get it for you.""Paul’s supporters rose to the challenge. Within hours after the debate’s end, the Internet swirled with what they said was proof that Cain called them ""ignorant.""Cain’s denial caught our attention. Did Cain really call Paul and his followers ""ignorant""?The Fed is a touchy issue among many Republicans, especially Paul supporters, who think it conducts too much business behind closed doors. Congress created the central bank of the United States to give the nation a more stable financial system, but Paul thinks the Fed brought about the current economic troubles through backroom dealings and bad policy. He wants the organization audited and abolished.Paul and Cain both consider themselves strict Constitutionalists and enemies of big government, but Cain is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. For Paul supporters, that’s like having a giant bull’s-eye painted on your back.Even before Cain announced his run for president, Paul supporters were dogging him at campaign stops, asking him to back a full audit of the Fed. (Cain’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve is the subject of a separate PolitiFact item.)We contacted Paul’s camp so it could give us its best evidence against Cain, but it didn’t get back to us. In its absence, we sifted through news accounts, news databases, Internet videos and websites where backers posted what they called key evidence of Cain’s name-calling.We found that Cain isn’t shy about his disdain for Paul’s criticisms. He’s not above calling someone ignorant, either. Last month, he said President Barack Obama showed ""ignorance of basic economics.""But we found no record that Cain ever called Paul or his backers ""ignorant.""Bloggers and news accounts repeatedly referred to two sources as proof against Cain: his recently released book ""This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House"" and a 2010 clip from Neal Boortz’s radio show. Cain frequently subbed in for Boortz when he was a talk show host on radio AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSBLet’s take a look at the book. Near the end of the chapter ""The Cain Doctrine,"" Cain wrote that Paul supporters stretch the truth whenever they attend his appearances and say he does not want an audit of the Federal Reserve.  Instead of calling Paul backers ""ignorant,"" Cain wrote this: ""I get the same stupid question at almost every one of these events. I know it’s a deliberate strategy. How can a person randomly show up at a hundred events and ask the same stupid question to try to nail me on the Federal Reserve? ""And this: ""But I’ve got news for the Paulites: It’s not going to work, because the American people are a lot smarter than they are.""Cain did call some people stupid, but not Paul’s supporters: ""[T]here are stupid people out there -- the people who are running this country, and I’m worried about them,"" Cain wrote.Now for Cain’s radio statement, which Paul backers posted online.""I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don’t know enough about it,"" Cain said, according to their online post. ""There’s no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge.""Once again, Cain did not use the word ""ignorant."" He did say backers of a Fed audit need to understand the bank better.How do we rule?Cain said plenty of disparaging things about Paul’s backers. He called their questions ""stupid."" He said Fed audit backers ""don’t know enough about it.""  He said the American people are are ""a lot smarter than they are.""You could even say that Cain ""belittled"" Paul’s followers, as the Texan claimed during the debate.But Paul was very specific that one of the ""strong terms"" Cain used against his backers was the word ""ignorant.""

At a news conference after its 63-35 passage, Brown called it ""the largest bipartisan jobs bill"" to win approval in many months.Opponents said they feared the legislation could spark a trade war with China at a time when the U.S. economy is already weak.Brown responded: ""Ohio workers and Ohio manufacturers already know that we are, in fact, in a trade war, and the Chinese have done very well, thank you.""The reason that this won't start the kind of trade war where the Chinese start being more aggressive even than they have been is we buy 35 percent of all Chinese exports,"" he said. ""They can't go to a trade war with a country that is such an important customer to them.""The claim that more than one-third of China’s exports are sold in U.S. markets got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We decided to take a look.Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, immediately told us that Brown ""misspoke when he said 35 percent. The figure is closer to 25 percent.""She referred us to the most recent statistics from the World Trade Organization. They show that China's exports totaled $1.2 trillion in 2009, and the U.S. imported $310 billion of them, or 26 percent.We looked further and found statistics from the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S Trade Representative that also showed the U.S. accounting for roughly 25 percent of Chinese exports.They showed that the United States is China's largest export market by a wide margin, spending about 30 percent more than second-ranked Hong Kong, more than twice as much as third-ranked Japan and buying more than four times the volume of fourth-place South Korea.The United States buys more than the next six countries in the top 10 combined.By coincidence, we found that Portman made a slip of the tongue several months ago while discussing trade with China, just a Brown did here. We rated that claim Half True and said then that his underlying point remained.In this case, Brown gave an incorrect number for the U.S. percentage of Chinese exports, which his staff readily pointed it out and corrected.  Regardless of that slip, he is correct that the United States is China’s top export destination. A one-quarter share is not as hefty as a one third share would be, but either way, the United States remains the most significant market for Chinese exports.But while PolitiFact Ohio isn’t looking to play Gotcha!, a key tenet is that words matter. In this case, Brown’s number is nearly 30 percent greater than the correct figure.On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement Half True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 19, 2021 in a Facebook post“Oil is now $61.30 a barrel and rising drastically!

Clarke Jr. wants you to know that Chris Abele is not the new sheriff in town.Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002, was spitting bullets when Abele --  the successor to former Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker  -- proposed balancing the 2012 county budget in large part by cutting deeply into Clarke’s agency.Abele is a ""novice"" with ""disdain for law and order"" and a desire to ""coddle criminals,"" Clarke said on the Sept. 30, 2011 ""Midday with Charlie Sykes"" show on WTMJ-AM (620). Abele, the sheriff went on, proposes ""gutting"" the Sheriff’s Department.The sheriff said he was very careful with taxpayer dollars, dating back to the Walker era, then added something that caught our ear.""I never asked for additional resources. I never asked for more,"" Clarke said. ""Every budget I’ve ever asked for is just a cost to continue. In other words, what we’re doing now, I’m satisfied with the money that you gave us last year. If you just give us that again, with the rate of inflation because salaries go up and all those kind of things, I said, ‘I’m fine.’He continued: ""And even with that, the (County Board) would turn around and take some money away. But you know, I can live with that. I don’t run the budget and I realize the finances are not infinite. The county’s in bad shape, I understand that.""We’re aware of Clarke’s past efforts to streamline the department and rein in overtime payments that before his arrival had routinely helped bust the budget.But did Clarke really confine himself -- every year -- to asking for inflationary increases?Let’s frame this dispute -- and then take a look at the numbers.Abele praises the Sheriff’s Department’s role but says that ""by statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency."" That’s the reason for the cuts, Abele told the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011.Clarke is outspoken in his criticism of liberal elected officials, and sees Abele as just that. Plus, Abele’s misinformed about public safety, Clarke says. In particular, Clarke took shots at Abele’s bold decision to try to direct Clarke to make specific cuts. That usurps the sheriff’s constitutional powers, Clarke argues.Now the numbers.Part of this is simple math. County records document what Clarke asked for each year compared with the adopted budget handed to him the year before. We looked at 10 budgets, from Clarke’s first in 2003 to the proposal he made for 2012.We found that in five years, his requests topped the previous year -- while in five years he asked for less or about the same.When he sought more, the increases ranged from 4 percent up to 13 percent. In every case through 2010, those increases were greater than inflation, based on the consumer price index for Milwaukee-Racine calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The government has not yet calculated 2011 rates.Seems cut and dried.But nothing involving Milwaukee County’s often-arcane and cumbersome budgeting process is simple, so we took a second look and talked to the sheriff and other county officials.First, Clarke.Through his budget officials, Clarke didn’t dispute that the county records, on their face, will show larger-than-inflation increases.But he said he is using a different standard: budget increases minus the costs for employee benefits.The different standard, of course, provides a different picture.Unless you’ve been been stuck in the deep tunnel for the past decade, you probably have some notion that skyrocketing pension costs after the notorious 2002 pension deal -- plus hyper-generous health insurance for county workers -- have driven up county costs and taxes dramatically.""As the County has downsized, the ‘legacy’ fringe benefits (obligations for those not still working here) have been spread across fewer employees.  The health care and pension cost increases have been everybody's problem,"" said Stephen Cady, the County Board’s fiscal and budget analyst. ""Each year, departments have had to cut to absorb the growing fringe costs that get allocated to their department.""Those fringe benefit costs are from active employees, too, not just retirees.Clarke says that if you remove those fringe costs, his budget requests collectively have come in under the inflation rate.He’s right -- at least when you compare inflation through 2010 (latest year available) to Clarke’s first eight budgets.But the inflation comparison works against him if you include 2011, when his request went up 13.4 percent. In that year, we should note, an accounting change involving Clarke’s bailiffs explained a big chunk of the increase.It’s not surprising that Clarke’s budgets look better by his definition: He’s removed one of the leading -- if not the leading -- inflationary driver in the county budget from his calculations.That issue affects all departments.""This is the cost of doing business,"" said Abele spokesman Jeff Bentoff. ""Every department is responsible for the fringe costs associated with their employees.""Indeed, other departments did not get the benefit of property tax-levy increases the Sheriff’s Department has seen. Abele says the department’s levy has gone up 62 percent in the decade, while Clarke says 37 percent is a fairer number. Either way it’s a big bump compared, for example, with the zero percent increase for the Parks Department, or the drop in levy for transit.Clarke has trimmed about one in five positions from his agency, thereby eliminating some employee fringe benefit costs. But that underscores he does have some control over those costs.In any case, Clarke’s leave-out-the-benefits approach is not the conventional way the budget is viewed. Nor did he note that limitation when he made the ear-catching statement.What’s more, if we looked at every department that way, tens of millions of dollars in county tax dollars would magically disappear from the books -- but not from that tax bill in your mailbox.Our conclusionClarke says he ""never asked for more"" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff.It’s true if you overlook the massive fringe benefit increases that have pushed up county costs, frustrating Clarke and every other department head who cut back only to see costs rise. But the bottom line is, Clarke’s redefinition of his budget requests is unofficial and not recorded in county records.We rate his statement False.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021","http://media2.620wtmj.com/SykesFullShow/093011_Sykesshow_part2.mp3,http://media2.620wtmj.com/SykesFullShow/093011_Sykesshow_part2.mp3,http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyExecutive/Press_Releases/2011/Abele2012BudgetRemarkstoCounty.pdf,http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyExecutive/Press_Releases/2011/Abele2012BudgetRemarkstoCounty.pdf,http://media2.620wtmj.com/SykesFullShow/093011_Sykesshow_part2.mp3,http://media2.620wtmj.com/SykesFullShow/093011_Sykesshow_part2.mp3,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/",,"County Budget,Criminal Justice,Wisconsin,David A.

Rick Perry continued: ""It is not safe on that (Texas-Mexico) border.""Democratic state Sen. José Rodríguez of El Paso countered in a press release two days later: ""The reality is that El Paso was named the ‘Safest Large City in the United States’ in 2010, just one year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the highest crime rates in the nation. In fact, last year, when El Paso reported just 7 murders, Perry’s home city of Austin reported 37,"" Rodríguez said. ""Why isn’t he talking about that?""Mild beef: Rodríguez aired slightly incorrect murder counts. In 2010, five murders occurred in El Paso, not seven, and 38 murders occurred in Austin, not 37, the cities’ police departments told us. Rodríguez spokeswoman Emily Amps Mora attributed the incorrect figures to typos. Also, five was El Paso’s lowest number of murders since 1965, and 38 was an unusually high number for Austin.But was El Paso deemed the ""Safest Large City"" in the United States after other Texas cities led the nation in crime?El Paso’s low crime rates have been noted for years. We looked at murder rates and overall crime rates, using FBI numbers, for the five Texas cities Rodríguez named: El Paso had the lowest rate per 100,000 residents in both categories each year from 2001 through 2010. In 2010, El Paso's murder rate was 0.8 murders per 100,000 residents. Rates for the other cities ranged from 4.8 for Austin to 11.8 for Houston.The so-called ""El Paso Miracle"" has drawn outside attention, particularly as violence has increased next door in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a city of 1.3 million which had more than 3,000 murders last year. The Texas Tribune, San Antonio Express-News and El Paso Times have recently written about El Paso’s low crime. Factors aired for the low crime rates include the presence of multiple federal agencies policing the border as well as the area’s high percentage of Hispanic residents (more than 80 percent), including Hispanic immigrants, a group described in a 2009 New York Times news story on El Paso’s safety as tending to be ""cautious, law-abiding and respectful of authority.""But ""Safest Large City"" is still an eye-opening title; Amps Mora said she picked it up from a Nov. 21, 2010, City of El Paso press release. The release says: ""The latest rating by CQ Press names El Paso as the 1st Safest City followed by Honolulu, HI as the 2nd Safest City and New York, NY as the 3rd Safest City in the United States. This rating, developed by CQ Press, compares cities with a population of more than 500,000 people.""CQ Press, a Washington, D.C.-based publisher, produces annual lists and books of crime statistics. However, it does not reward cities with ""Safest"" or ""Most Dangerous"" designations. In a Dec. 3, 2010, blog post, The Wall Street Journal said the annual reports stopped including such labels after CQ bought the reports’ publisher in 2007.In an interview, Darrel Petry, spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, told us that the department solely used the ""Safest Large City"" designation in the Nov. 21 press release and did not repeat it, in part because of objections to CQ’s rankings immediately raised by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.Regardless, El Paso did indeed top CQ’s 2010 ""Lowest Crime Rate"" list for cities with more than 500,000 residents.Next, we looked at Rodríguez’s statement about San Antonio, Houston and Dallas, which Amps Mora told us was based on a 2010 Dallas Morning News blog post. The post spells out that among the nine U.S. cities over 1 million, the highest crime rates using 2009 numbers were in San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Philadelphia and Phoenix. We got similar results, using FBI 2009 data for the standard categories of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft: San Antonio first, then Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York.But again: These rankings are for cities over 1 million in population. There are only nine on that list (Chicago being excluded because it counted rapes differently) -- so it would be equally valid to say that in looking at lowest crime rates, San Antonio was No. 9 in the country.So did San Antonio, Houston and Dallas have ""the highest crime rates in the nation,"" as Rodriguez said? No, it turns out. Using crime rates per 100,000 in all cities for which the FBI collected data in 2009’s Uniform Crime Reports, the five cities with the highest crime rates were Vernon, Calif., population 90; Industry, Calif., population 930; Black Hawk, Colo., population 104; Teterboro, N.J., population 17; and Mackinac Island, Mich., population 456. San Antonio is the first of the Texas cities cited by Rodriguez to land on this list of all cities -- in 472nd place.Now, of course, that list we just rattled off is misleading, even ridiculous, because of the huge spread of population sizes among ""all"" U.S. cities. For a more serious comparison, we looked over crime statistics for cities with more than 500,000 residents.The five with the highest crime rates per 100,000 residents in the 2009 numbers were Memphis, Tenn.; Detroit; Atlanta; San Antonio; and Columbus, Ohio.And finally, if we use CQ Press’ rankings for cities over 500,000 -- a list adjusted with the company’s particular methodology -- the five highest-crime cities were Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Washington D.C. and Atlanta. Houston, the first Texas city to crop up, was No. 9.As we completed this check, we circled back to Amps Mora, who said by email that the senator's point holds. Objectively, by crime rates, she said, El Paso is safer than bigger Texas cities that also are not on the Texas-Mexico border.Our rulingEl Paso has had low crime rates, and its murder rates are considerably below those of the other cited cities.But the statement is misleading in two meaningful ways.

It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities.  Prepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohio’s 18 congressional districts into 16 districts — 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage.As he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering — the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles.Now represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a ""reverse Pac-man,"" in Redfern’s words.""To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steve’s district you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls,"" Redfern told reporters at his news conference.Sure, the district is a sprawling one — but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road.Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redfern’s assertion.He forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County.Google maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours — 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps.PolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers’ new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route — they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers’ district.But they had to. Or you’d have to swim.""It’s so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it,"" The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. ""He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other.""Bringman acknowledged that the map was more of ""an interpretation"" of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it.""To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval.""Additionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times — it’s not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another.For example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you can’t use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though it’s a direct link between the two cities.""He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district,"" said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers’ Columbus congressional office. ""There isn’t any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house.""Redfern’s statement does include the phrase ""without leaving Stivers’ district"" but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear.So after all this ramblin’ through Ohio, where do we end up?Google maps estimates Redfern’s route plotted through the ""reverse Pac-man"" district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls.The claim has to take a detour, though, because it’s not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redfern’s larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose.Lastly, it needs to be said that Redfern’s route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. That’s a point that provides clarification.On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern’s claim Mostly True. Featured Fact-checkJenna Wadsworthstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.""By Paul Specht • February 1, 2021","http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/other/District%2015%20tour.pdf,/personalities/jenna-wadsworth/,/factchecks/2021/feb/02/jenna-wadsworth/elaine-marshall-has-won-more-statewide-races-anyon/",,"Ohio,Elections,Redistricting,Chris Redfern",,,,,

Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico and contender for the GOP nomination, enjoys stirring the pot within his party, and on a visit in New Hampshire he said, ""It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees.""Set aside for a moment that capital punishment is mainly up to the states. Beyond the federal death penalty, presidents don't have much to do with the matter. Johnson is making a fiscal argument -- the death penalty costs too much -- and he's making it at a moment when state budgets face huge pressures. Elected officials and taxpayers in every state might be curious to know if he's right.The Johnson campaign cites the Death Penalty Information Center as the source of its claim.  The website of this anti-death penalty group lists 18 studies that examine costs. All of them conclude that as soon as a prosecutor decides to go for capital punishment,  the price tag just for the legal work itself goes up. How much depends on the state. A 2008 study in Maryland found it was three-times more expensive; an analysis from Indiana in 2002 said it costs five- times more.No one on either side of the issue disputes these higher costs. Remember, we’re only talking about the legal process, not the cost of keeping someone behind bars or paying for the executions themselves. DPIC Executive Director, Richard Dieter, says when the death penalty is on the table, the constitutional scrutiny is intense with more lawyers and more hearings. ""People are more skeptical,"" Dieter said. ""There are more tests -- DNA, mental illness, retardation, experts are brought in.""To get at the full picture, the legal costs, plus everything else, arguably the most useful report is one that doesn’t appear on the DPIC web site, although it is cited by several that do. It comes from George Mason University and sizes up what it called three of the best studies with an eye on the big question, does a sentence of life without parole cost less than the death penalty?The results tend to support the idea that imprisonment is cheaper but not across all three states examined. In North Carolina, researchers said a life sentence would save $163,000 per case; Indiana pegged the number a bit lower at $116,000. But in Tennessee, analysts concluded that executions were cheaper by a lot -- some $773,000.The value of the George Mason study is it picks apart the data behind those numbers. It has high praise for the Indiana work, calling it the gold standard for assessing costs. It gives a nod to the North Carolina team but notes that the work was done in the early 1990’s and is dated because the rules for death penalty cases have changed. As for the Tennessee research, it notes that it relied on very limited data, something that the authors in Tennessee acknowledged. Not the least of the problems was that Tennessee had executed just one person during the period the study analyzed.The main problem Gov. Johnson might  have in supporting his claim is that the death penalty plays out differently from state to state. States apply the death penalty to different crimes. Some put more money into giving the accused a strong defense and find their convictions upheld. Others cut corners on the front end and wind up paying for two trials. The court systems in some states get bogged down administering the cases of hundreds of people on death row; others work with ten or fewer.All of these factors affect how quickly a state processes a death penalty case and speed has big implications for a key piece of Johnson’s argument, that it’s the legal fees that make the death penalty more expensive.The common belief is that appeals are where most of the dollars go. That too depends on the state. A detailed study of more than two decades of murder prosecutions in Maryland found that 70% of the costs come in the pre-trial and trial phases. But the author of that study, John Roman, says in other states, lengthy appeals eventually can add up. In 2008 alone, California set aside $42 million just for the appeals process, or about $68,000 per inmate on death row.As with every other step in these cases, the government generally pays for both the prosecution and the defense during appeals.To some people, the solution lies in making the death penalty swifter. Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group that supports the death penalty, says states like Virginia have built a process that is fair and, in capital punishment terms, speedy. From conviction to execution takes about seven years in Virginia. In California, it runs closer to 20 years. The average is over 10 years.""You get more bang for your criminal justice buck in Virginia,"" Rushford said. ""Johnson can make that speech in California. He couldn't make it in Virginia or Delaware.""At the end of the day, it’s difficult to make broad statements about the cost of the death penalty that hold true in every state. The dollars spent depend on many factors, including how many people the government tries to put on death row, how it handles appeals and the fraction of death row inmates that ultimately are executed. The author of the Maryland study, John Roman, has a rough rule of thumb for determining which is cheaper, life imprisonment and death. It's not one that the death penalty opponents would like.  ""If you don't execute lots of people,"" Roman said, ""the death sentence is more expensive.""  Because the costs of appeals add up over time. On the other hand, Roman continues,"" If you execute lots of people, then life imprisonment probably turns out to be more expensive."" And that's because, the shorter the time between sentencing and execution, the less the government spends on appeals and imprisonment.Our RulingJohnson said life imprisonment is cheaper than the death penalty because of attorney fees. If we define attorney fees broadly, there is ample evidence that as soon as a prosecutor decides to seek capital punishment, it dramatically increases the price tag for taxpayers, who are paying for the defense as well as the prosecution.The meter continues to run during the appeals process. The shorter that process, the greater the cost effectiveness of an execution. But as a practical matter, for reasons rooted in both state and federal procedure, the process often lasts close to a decade or more.That means that the costs in some states don't support Johnson's claim that life imprisonment is cheaper because of attorney's fees. So we rate his statement Half True.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021","http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/,http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty,http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/CostsDPMaryland.pdf,http://journals.gmu.edu/index.php/newvoices/article/viewFile/13/28,http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/CostsDPMaryland.pdf,http://www.cjlf.org/,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/",,"National,Criminal Justice,New Hampshire 2012,Gary Johnson",,,,,

Republicans, generally, want to leave the refund law alone and force the state to save money by spending less. Democrats, generally, say the kicker is a constitutionally built-in anti-savings mechanism.For those who don’t know, the kicker is officially called the state’s surplus refund law. It requires a refund to taxpayers if the state collects more money in taxes -- by at least 2 percent -- than economists projected. The idea is to make sure legislators don’t spend every dime they get from taxpayers.Former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat who represented part of Clackamas County, recently wrote a guest column for The Oregonian in which he urged the state to divert the kicker and use the money to build a savings fund that could boost our credit rating, which in turn would save millions of dollars in lower interest payments.""The ratings agencies will not upgrade Oregon's credit rating until we stabilize state finances, and they realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system,"" he wrote.We can’t predict what ratings agencies will or won’t do, and neither can anyone else. Instead, PolitiFact Oregon had a simple question: Do credit ratings analysts actually finger the kicker as responsible for the state’s financial instability?Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, which promotes limited government, argues that without the kicker, legislators would spend every penny on hand for pay raises and new programs. The pressure not to spend is too great, he said.On the other hand, the kicker could ""kick"" at awkward times, for example, after drastic funding reductions, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve illustrates in this 2009 news story: ""At the end of each legislative session, the state economist makes his best guess about how much revenue the state stands to receive over the next two years. He has lots of data to work with, and a complex set of equations, matrices and algorithms. But it's still a guess.If he sets a low figure -- which makes sense this year given the current economic conditions -- and then the economy rebounds, the state could end up sending millions of dollars back to taxpayers at the same time it is making deep cuts to services. It happened during the last recession, in 2001, and there are growing fears it could happen again.""Featured Fact-checkRick Scottstated on February 1, 2021 in a press releaseStates are seeing increases in revenue, with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019. Over half of states report positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.By Jon Greenberg • February 5, 2021See the problem?Let’s turn to the actual reports, to see for ourselves what analysts have said. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, and Fitch are the houses that determine our creditworthiness, which in turn determines the interest rate at which we borrow money. For example, they loved that Oregon started a savings fund in 2007 by diverting the corporate kicker that year.All three agencies consistently cite the state’s narrow reliance on economically sensitive corporate and personal income tax revenues as a negative.They also dislike Oregon’s active citizen initiative process because it means voters can restrict how much money we collect and how we spend that money. Their big issue is reliability.  Many times, but not always, the kicker law is singled out as an added concern. A March 7 Moody’s report says the kicker ""adds budgetary challenges, including cash flow pressures.""Does that mean that a repeal of the kicker would increase our rating? Or that the existence of the kicker means we’re doomed to a lower rating? Kimberly Lyons, the primary analyst for Moody’s for Oregon, wouldn’t go so far. Ability to govern is what they measure and the kicker is not a defacto defect, Lyons said.""There are other ways to make the structure work for the state. As long as the state is structurally balanced, that’s all we care about.""But Gabriel Petek of Standard & Poor’s was more willing to weigh in on the kicker. He said that while Oregon’s reliance on income taxes is the ""main driver"" of the state’s financial volatility, the kicker makes it difficult to build reserves because we can’t reap the benefits of economic upsides to manage for the economic downsides. It’s as if we’ve deliberately hobbled ourselves.Back to Barton. He checked in with PolitiFact Oregon while traveling. He said he should have stressed that the kicker magnifies Oregon’s fiscal instability rather than causes it.""I probably should have been more precise in wording that sentence, as the verb ‘stems’ implies causation more than magnification. However, the fact remains that the ratings agencies recognize that the kicker system contributes significantly to Oregon's unstable fiscal system."" Finally, we checked in with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler, who manages our money.  He acknowledged that if Oregon had jobs galore and oodles of extra money in the bank, the ratings agencies could upgrade us anyway, without kicker reform. But that’s not the case, he said, and so analysts continue to call out the kicker as a concern.But doesn’t our financial instability really stem from our unnaturally high reliance on income and corporate taxes?""The two go hand-in-hand. You can’t really separate them,"" Wheeler said.""You’ve got the volatility from our reliance on the income tax, which in my mind is the most significant issue. You have all of your eggs in one basket, and the basket we’ve chosen is the volatility basket, and then when you combine the kicker with that, the two really are like the evil twins. They work hand in hand to make it hard for government to plan through a reliable revenue structure.""So what have we learned? Certainly government could save money without the kicker. But the kicker does exacerbate the volatility of the system that we’ve chosen to pay for public services. And the two analysts we interviewed were understandably wishy washy on how Oregon’s kicker figures into the state’s credit rating.In a previous PolitiFact, we gave Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, a Mostly False for saying that previous Legislatures suspended the kicker, spent every dime and failed to stabilize state finances. (We explained that serious context was missing.)In this PolitiFact, we come to a similar conclusion about Barton’s statement regarding the kicker’s relationship to financial stability. Oregon’s instability stems mainly from our heavy reliance on one revenue stream. The simplest way to counter that may be to divert the kicker. But a bigger difference, the reports suggest, would be made by adding other taxes -- hello, sales? -- to diversify Oregon’s revenue base. (Sorry, we had to say it.)We rate the claim Mostly False.","http://www.ost.state.or.us/News/Releases/2011/040711%20Treasurer%20calls%20for%20changes%20to%20kicker%20law,%20increase%20reserves.pdf,http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/08/aaa_credit_oregon_could_save_m.html,http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2009/04/oregon_lawmakers_ponder_change.html,/personalities/rick-scott/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/rick-scott/sen-rick-scott-misrepresents-covid-19s-toll-state-/,http://www.standardandpoors.com/home/en/us,http://www.moodys.com/,http://www.fitchratings.com/index_fitchratings.cfm,https://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2011/sep/10/matt-wand/rep-matt-wand-says-using-kicker-money-has-failed-s/,http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/08/dont_kick_the_kicker_improving.html",,"Oregon,State Budget,Brent Barton",,,,,
502,,,,false,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/sep/16/michele-bachmann/bachmann-hpv-vaccine-cause-mental-retardation/,Says the vaccine to prevent HPV can cause mental retardation.,,politifact,,"After criticizing Texas Gov. Rick Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls, Rep. Michele Bachmann added some scary charges: She claimed to have just met a woman whose daughter suffered mental retardation from the vaccine, that it has ""very dangerous consequences"" and that it puts ""little children's lives at risk.""In the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, Bachmann blasted Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls to guard against human papilloma virus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer. The vaccine can prevent the virus, but the virus is sexually transmitted, which makes the idea of requiring the inoculation of young girls controversial among some parents. Perry issued an executive order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccination against HPV. The order included an opt-out, allowing exemptions if parents objected for philosophical or religious reasons. (Read more on the history of the executive order.)Critics raised two major objections to Perry's 2007 order -- that the state should not require vaccinations for sexually transmitted diseases, and that parents should be asked beforehand whether they wanted their children vaccinated. The Legislature overruled Perry's order, and during the presidential campaign, Perry has said he made a mistake by ordering the vaccinations without consent of the Legislature. During the debate, Bachmann suggested that the vaccine maker, Merck & Co., used political influence to get Perry's approval for the vaccine, Gardasil. She also suggested that the vaccine might be harmful to the young girls who received it, saying, ""Little girls who have a negative reaction to this potentially dangerous drug don't get a 'mulligan'"" -- that is, a do-over.Bachmann received applause for her attacks. But in subsequent interviews, Bachmann became more specific that the vaccine harmed children's health.Here's what she said in an interview on Fox News:""There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate. She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result of that vaccine. There are very dangerous consequences. It's not good enough to take, quote, 'a mulligan' where you want a do-over, not when you have little children's lives at risk.""And here's what she told NBC's ""Today Show"":Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021""Well, I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida, after the debate,"" Bachmann said. ""She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. It can have very dangerous side effects. The mother was crying what she came up to me last night. I didn't know who she was before the debate. This is a very real concern and people have to draw their own conclusions.""So while Bachmann hedged somewhat that people can ""draw their own conclusions,"" she still made a very clear suggestion that the vaccine can cause retardation and puts ""little children's lives at risk.""When asked about the remark on Sept. 15, 2011, in San Rafael, Calif., Bachmann continued to hedge somewhat, saying, ""I didn't make any statements that would indicate I'm a doctor, I'm a scientist, or making any conclusions about the drug one way or the other."" She added that she was merely relaying the concerns of a woman who was ""very distraught."" But Bachmann turned down a chance to apologize for her earlier comments.Soon after Bachmann made the claim, medical professionals raced to counter the notion that an HPV vaccination can cause mental retardation.The American Academy of Pediatrics, which includes 60,000 primary care pediatricians, released the following statement:""The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that girls receive HPV vaccine around age 11 or 12. That’s because this is the age at which the vaccine produces the best immune response in the body, and because it’s important to protect girls well before the onset of sexual activity. In the U.S., about 6 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year, and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer. This is a life-saving vaccine that can protect girls from cervical cancer.""Many in the medical community pointed to the vaccine's track record in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. This is a database co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that tracks ""adverse"" health events following vaccinations, ranging from minor to serious. The database has limitations -- some adverse events may not be overlooked if VAERS isn't notified, and the agencies who run it caution that just because an adverse event happened, it doesn't mean that the vaccination was the cause.However, VAERS is the largest such database available, and measured by its standards, the HPV vaccine in question has fared well in terms of possible side effects:""As of June 22, 2011, approximately 35 million doses of Gardasil were distributed in the U.S. and VAERS received a total of 18,727 reports of adverse events following Gardasil vaccination. ... Of the total number of VAERS reports following Gardasil, 92 percent were considered to be non-serious, and 8 percent were considered serious. ... The vast majority (92 percent) of the adverse events reports following Gardasil vaccination have included fainting, pain, and swelling at the injection site (the arm), headache, nausea, and fever. Syncope (fainting) is common after injections and vaccinations, especially in adolescents. Falls after fainting may sometimes cause serious injuries, such as head injuries, which can be prevented by closely observing the person for 15 minutes after vaccination.""The remaining 8 percent of adverse events included such serious ailments as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a nervous system disorder, blood clots and even death. However, the official analysis of the VAERS data is that the incidence of Guillain-Barré did not exceed the level in the comparable population at large, that ""most"" of the people who experienced blood clots also had other risk factors for clots, and that analysis of the 32 confirmed deaths suggested that either the deaths had been attributed to other causes or that ""there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.""Notably absent is any mention of mental retardation. And the official conclusion based on the VAERS data is this: ""Based on all of the information we have today, CDC recommends HPV vaccination for the prevention of most types of cervical cancer.""As our friends at FactCheck.org also noted, a blue ribbon panel convened by the Institute of Medicine has released a report in August about adverse events and vaccines, including HPV vaccines. The experts did find ""strong and generally suggestive"" evidence that a different condition -- a serious allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis -- may be caused by the HPV vaccine. It also found four published reports of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, a neurological condition that could impair mental capabilities. But Joseph Bocchini -- the chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Shreveport) and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- told FactCheck.org that even if the symptoms of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis mirrored those seen by the woman who spoke to Bachmann, the number of cases was too small to assign any causal connection to the vaccine.So, beyond anaphylaxis, the IOM panel did not find any causal evidence to link adverse events to the vaccine.We checked with a couple experts in pediatric medicine for their view on Bachmann's claim. They said there was no scientific evidence to support it, and they added that the HPV vaccine has undergone the full complement of safety testing that all vaccines must undergo before going on the market. ""I have no qualms about advising this is a safe vaccine,"" said Christopher Harrison, a doctor and the director of the infectious disease research laboratory at Children's Mercy Hospitals in Kansas City, Mo. ""The millions of doses that have been given make clinicians comfortable recommending and giving it.""""I've given it to both my daughters,"" said Kenneth Alexander, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Chicago Medical Center. ""It's as safe or safer as any vaccine out there.""""This is an anti-cancer vaccine. We should be going to the rooftops and shouting 'Huzzah!'"" said William Schaffner, chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.Our rulingIn several national television appearances, Bachmann said a woman reported her child had experienced mental retardation after receiving an HPV vaccination. We can't judge the specifics of that case -- neither the woman nor the daughter have been identified as far as we could find and skeptics have offered a reward if the victim can be found. But even if Bachmann's portrayal of what happened is accurate, it falls well short of the scientific standard for demonstrating causality between an inoculation and an adverse health event.

Bill Pascrell says public-sector layoffs are dragging down the nation’s overall job growth.The country had no net job growth in August, a month where the private sector added 17,000 jobs and the public sector shed the same amount, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) in a recent radio interview about August’s stagnant employment numbers. Pascrell called the federal jobs report ""disappointing"" and highlighted the larger impact of decreasing government employment.""We’ve lost public jobs,"" Pascrell said in the Sept. 2 interview. ""Whether it's policemen, firemen, sanitation people, we got to understand that there's six to seven hundred thousand of these folks who have been laid off [in the last] year and a half. If we continue to put our heads in the sand and don't recognize that that's part of the equation as well, then we're never going to address this.""The nation didn’t lose as many government jobs in the time frame Pascrell mentioned, but his numbers aren’t far off. And while there’s debate on whether smaller government is better for the economy, we won’t be ruling on that issue in this Truth-O-Meter item.Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker, told PolitiFact New Jersey the congressman was referring to local, state and federal government workers in his interview.Brubaker sent us an article from U.S. News & World Report that said, ""Since the end of the recession, government employment -- including federal, state, and local jobs -- has fallen by roughly 600,000."" The actual number is 595,000, according to seasonally-adjusted federal data.But Pascrell didn’t reference the end of the recession -- which the National Bureau of Economic Research says ended in June 2009 -- in the radio interview.Still, if we hold Pascrell strictly to the time frame he mentioned, he’s not wildly off from the range he cited.In the past 18 months -- from February 2010 to August, the most recent data available -- the nation lost 512,000 government jobs. During the same time frame, nearly 2.4 million private-sector jobs were created. The decrease in public-sector jobs offset the net total in those 18 months by nearly 21 percent, to about 1.9 million.We reached out to two experts from Washington, D.C. think tanks for their take on the role that decreasing public-sector employment has had on the current jobs situation.""Losses in government employment help account for the fact that overall job growth has been so slow,"" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank. ""Drops in government employment have worsened the nation’s employment picture and worsened the prospects of unemployed workers who are seeking to get re-employed or to get their first career jobs.""James Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said ""public-sector job losses have had a relatively minor role in the U.S. employment situation thus far"" and ""government jobs will not play a constructive role in pulling the U.S. out of its current situation.""It’s worth noting that state and local governments employ the vast majority of public workers. Of all government employees, 64 percent work for local governments, 23 percent work for state governments and 13 percent work for the federal government.In New Jersey, 30,500 public jobs were eliminated in the 18 months from January 2010 to July, the most recent state-level figures available.  Of those jobs, 18,200 were in local government, 10,900 were in state government and 1,400 were in federal government.The rulingPascrell said 600,000 to 700,000 public employees have been laid off in the last year and a half.According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation has lost 512,000 government jobs at the federal, state and local level in the past 18 months.Pascrell’s numbers were off, but not wildly off. And his argument that public-sector job losses are having an impact on net job growth is valid.We rate his statement Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/,http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/politifact_new_jersey_rep_pasc.html",,"New Jersey,Jobs,Bill Pascrell",,,,,

Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are … shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.""",,politifact,,"For members of Congress, the ""town hall"" meeting with constituents has taken on a new dynamic. The once-routine chats with the folks back home have, at times, become highly charged sessions with large crowds. They’ve become a barometer of sorts of public sentiment -- or the ability of opponents to organize.Democrats faced hostile crowds during the summer of 2009 when the hot topic was the federal health care reform bill. Some of the meetings drew hundreds and saw shouting, pushing and shoving. President Barack Obama decried what he called ""scare tactics"" from opponents. And one left leaning blog ran a list of dozens of town hall meetings believed to be targeted for disruption.Congressional Republicans got a similar reception in the spring and summer of 2011.The frequent topic: Proposals by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to alter Medicare. Tempers flared and meetings were disrupted, including one in April in Racine where Ryan asked police to remove a protester.So as Congress settled into its August break, the Wisconsin Democratic Party took a shot at some of the state’s GOP members of Congress -- Ryan, and freshmen Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble.In an Aug. 17, 2011 email to supporters, state Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate said: ""Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records that they are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.""Buried amid the heated, and opinionated, rhetoric -- ""so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records"" -- there’s a powerful factual claim: Are the three ""shutting down"" town hall meetings or ""making constituents pay"" to see them?A Democratic Party spokesman did not respond to an email request for evidence backing up the statement. So we were left to search the public record and to make our own calls.The genesis of the claim appears to be a Politico article from the day before the party’s release that began this way: ""The House Budget Committee chairman isn’t holding any face-to-face open-to-the-public town hall meetings during the recess, but like several of his colleagues he will speak only for residents willing to open their wallets.""Now, what about the party’s claim?The claim starts off on a wrong track: Ribble participated in a forum in Appleton on Aug. 8, 2011, and Duffy held a town hall meeting in Wausau on Aug. 15, 2011. Ryan, meanwhile, held an Aug. 8, 2011 ""telephone town hall meeting"" with residents of Rock County.So, all three had meetings of some variety -- in person or the newfangled phone-in approach -- before the party’s claim was even made.Indeed, members of Congress don’t always have town hall meetings during a recess. And by at least one measure, Republicans were more likely to do so this time than Democrats.A nonpartisan group called No Labels released a survey Aug. 22, 2011 that found ""67.9% of Democrats and 50.8% of Republicans stating they had no town hall meetings scheduled for the recess period.""So what about the second thrust of the Democratic claim: Are the Republicans hiding behind a pay wall?We found three events where money was involved. The events were not fund-raisers for the congressmen, but lunch meetings open to the public that carried a cost.The most highly publicized -- and politicized -- one is an appearance by Ryan on Sept. 6, 2011 sponsored by the Whitnall Park Rotary Club.The club’s website says: ""This is NOT a town hall meeting format, and the $15 fee covers only the lunch and other costs incurred in enabling an open public invitation.""Club officer Gilbert Freen told us the group routinely charges guests to cover the cost of the lunch served at its meetings.The Democrats, some union groups and others view this as outrageous. Citizen Action of Wisconsin says it is organizing buses to bring people to protest Ryan’s appearance.But politicians of all stripes regularly appear at such luncheons.For instance, on Aug. 23, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis) spoke to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. That event was not open to the public -- just to members and their guests, who paid $17.50 each. Numerous other politicians (including Ryan and Moore together in 2009) have appeared at Newsmaker Luncheons sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club. At those events, which are open to the public, a fee is charged -- for the lunch.Ryan’s office said the Whitnall club meeting was the only event the congressman had scheduled during the August break that involved a charge.We found two other paid events, one each from Ribble and Duffy.Ribble’s office said he participated in the Aug. 8 forum addressing regulation with two other local civic groups. ""I believe it was at lunchtime and there was a cost for the lunch,"" said Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson.Duffy participated in one event -- an Aug. 18, 2011 small business forum at the University of Wisconsin-Superior -- where participants were charged $15 for lunch and materials.So, each of the three GOP congressmen singled out had at least one event where a fee was charged. But such appearances are routine tor politicians of both parties, the fee covered lunch and did not go to the congressman.  The thrust of the statement, though, was broader still -- that the three were ""shutting down"" town hall meetings and thus the ability to talk to the elected official.Here’s what we found about the summer recess schedule for each when we asked aides, checked public schedules and looked at news accounts:Ryan:  Toured various local businesses, held ""multiple hour-long meetings"" with small business owners, Realtors and home builders. In addition to the ""telephone town hall meeting,"" attended the Walworth County Fair, a Boy Scout lunch and a 75th anniversary lunch for Kenosha Beef. Constituents could contact Ryan’s office for an appointment to meet with him in his office, said spokesman Conor Sweeney. Ryan was on vacation in Colorado for part of the month.Ribble: Held a three-hour ""Conversations with your Congressman"" on Aug. 13, 2011 -- 10 minute one-on-one meetings; attended an Aug. 12, 2011 forum on transportation; an Alzheimers Association public input session, and a forum with seniors about Medicare.Duffy: Like many House members with large districts, Duffy maintains a mobile office, and its schedule is listed prominently on the congressman’s web page. Duffy himself is on the bus some, but not all, of the time, said Brandon Moody, chief of staff. Moody said Duffy has spent the entire August break in his northern Wisconsin district. Including the town meeting in Wausau, he held a half dozen coffees and, yes, community town hall meetings. He also visited county fairs and toured area businesses.No fee was charged for any of these events, or for access to the congressman.Our conclusion:The state Democrats say that three Republican congressmen from Wisconsin are shutting down town hall meetings or making constituents pay to attend them. Yet all three had town hall meetings or participated in a forum -- in person, or by phone -- before the statement was made. And one, Duffy, participated in several town hall meetings.In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. What’s more, the party provided no evidence Ryan or the others were not available to constituents during the break.Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is ""charging constituents"" for access is far off the mark.The party’s claim is not only false, but ridiculously so.

Sherrod Brown next year.At an Aug. 18 stop in Strongsville, Coughlin told the Strong Ohio tea party group he believes the science behind global warming is ""sketchy.""""Scientists who consider themselves to be environmentalists disagree on the science and the impact,"" Coughlin said. ""There is no question that the earth’s core is increasing slightly in temperature.""But the real question and I think what’s pertinent to the debate in our country and in global politics is how much people really contributed to it and I don’t really think there’s much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.  We contacted Coughlin, whose appearance was captured on video by a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century. He acknowledged making the remarks, although he said meant to say the Earth’s atmosphere -- not its core -- is rising in temperature.But do scientists agree with his assertion that there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""Many Republican politicians apart from Coughlin assert that scientists disagree whether human actions contribute to global warming.Before he dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last month, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told the Miami Herald newspaper ""the science is in dispute"" over ""how much, if any"" climate change can be blamed on human behavior. At an Aug. 17 New Hampshire campaign stop, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that scientists are regularly ""coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""PolitiFact examined these claims by Pawlenty and Perry, and found them to be False. That’s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming.To begin with, a 2007 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading international scientific body on climate science, states: ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)A 2009 report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program reached a similar conclusion: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""Current climate change research was reviewed again this year by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. The committee it assembled concluded that global warming poses significant risks and is happening primarily because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It rejected the idea that those findings are in any way questionable.""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee’s report said.A few scientists dispute the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming, but most acknowledge that humans contribute to increased temperatures. They make more nuanced points, like  questioning whether carbon emissions by themselves are enough to boost temperatures, whether other human activities contribute, whether rising temperatures cause severe weather, and whether public policy change is needed to address potential problems.Climate change skeptics cite an online petition with more than 31,000 signatures to demonstrate their viewpoint is widespread. The petition states ""there’s no convincing scientific evidence"" that human greenhouse gas releases are disrupting the Earth’s climate, and there’s ""substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects"" on Earth’s plants and animals. That petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving they exist.But surveys of large numbers of climate researchers show a clear consensus among them that humans are causing climate change.One 2010 study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 97 to 98 percent out of 1,372 climate researchers who are publishing scientific studies in the field say they believe that human beings are causing climate change, and that the scientific credentials of researchers who doubt that role are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""A study published the previous year by the American Geophysical Union, asked more than 3,100 scientists whether they think human activity significantly contributes to ""changing mean global temperatures."" About 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered ""Yes,"" with a 97.4 percent affirmative rate among climate change specialists.While a few skeptics out there disagree, there’s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it. Disagreement on the subject is scant enough that we rule Coughlin’s statement is False.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021","http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/08/03/2344205/tim-pawlenty-talks-gay-marriage.html,http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/perry-tells-n-h-audience-he-s-a-global-warming-skeptic-with-video-20110817,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-more-and-more-scientists-are-quest/,https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html,http://www.globalchange.gov/,http://americasclimatechoices.org/ACC_Final_Report_Brief04.pdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all,https://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/2008/06/26/house-testimony-of-roger-a-pielke-sr-a-broader-view-of-the-role-of-humans-in-the-climate-system-is-required-in-the-assessment-of-costs-and-benefits-effective-climate-policy/,http://www.petitionproject.org/index.php,https://wayback.archive.org/web/jsp/Interstitial.jsp?seconds=5&date=1156337425000&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciam.com%2Fpage.cfm%3Fsection%3Dsidebar%26articleID%3D0004F43C-DC1A-1C6E-84A9809EC588EF21&target=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20060823125025%2Fhttp%3A%2Fwww.sciam.com%2Fpage.cfm%3Fsection%3Dsidebar%26articleID%3D0004F43C-DC1A-1C6E-84A9809EC588EF21,http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/06/04/1003187107.full.pdf+html,http://tigger.uic.edu/%7Epdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Environment,Ohio,Climate Change,Kevin Coughlin",,,,,

Scott Walker signed the 2011-13 state budget in June. But that didn’t stop the spending plan from playing a prominent role in the state Senate recall campaigns in August.Republicans worked to paint their Democratic opponents -- the members of the Assembly running against GOP senators and Democratic senators defending their seats -- as reckless spenders who left a mess to be cleaned up. The refrain was that the Democratic lawmakers, along with former Gov. Jim Doyle, are to blame for the state being bankrupt or broke.There were many variations of it, but one seemed worth visiting even though the recall elections are over. Why? Some claims have a way of being recycled for future campaigns.The one we are looking at came in a radio ad by Republican Jonathan Steitz, who lost his bid to unseat Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) in the Aug. 16, 2011 recall electionThe ad said:""Wirch voted to raise job-killing taxes by $4.7 billion, and voted for $3.6 billion in out-of-control reckless government spending ...  and after all those taxes and all that spending ...  Wirch left us with three billion in debt... only to flee to Illinois instead of staying to get the job done.""Call it the $3.6 billion question. Or, in this case, $3.6 billion accusation.We previously rated False a statement by state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that Walker’s estimate of the budget deficit was a ""bogus figure."" We also found Doyle’s late 2010 estimate of the size of the deficit was False, in part because it included many assumptions about what Walker might do. And we found Walker’s statement that the state was ""broke"" to be False. (We’ve also ruled on several statements about the ""structural deficit"" -- an entirely  different matter.)See what we mean about themes coming up again and again?So, back to the claim: Did Democrats under Doyle approve a budget that left the state in debt?Not a deficit. Debt.The short answer is no. That’s not how the budget process works, said Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The state constitution requires lawmakers approve a budget that’s balanced, and the budget that was passed for 2009-11 was no exception.The $3.6 billion figure came about when the state budget office looked at the 2009-2011 budget, as plans were being readied for the next one (the 2011-13 budget). The report considers tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget, and came up with what Lang termed a ""shortfall.""To be sure, the calculation depended on which party is running the budget office.In November 2010, the outgoing Doyle administration said the shortfall was $1.5 billion, which was far lower than the $2.7 billion figure used by candidates during the campaign for governor. In February 2011, Walker’s Department of Administration ran its own version of the numbers and concluded that the shortfall was $3.6 billion.So what does that number represent?""It’s a challenge,"" Lang said of the figure. ""The challenge for the 2011-13 budget was $3.6 billion.""In other words, that was the amount -- through a combination of spending cuts, tax increases or other measures -- that the state budget would have to be adjusted to account for all of the department budget requests and the projected tax revenue.One thing is clear: The $3.6 billion was not a debt, as Steitz claimed.Debt is something that is owed, typically over the long term. Borrowed money, for instance.The state did not borrow, bond or otherwise owe money to anyone because of the $3.6 billion. Other steps -- some very controversial politically -- were taken to address the gap.Lang put it this way: ""We did not have a deficit, nor were we in debt.""Lang noted that the shorthand for the shortfall, including in Journal Sentinel news accounts, was a ""deficit"" -- but rarely, if ever, a debt.That brings us to the bottom line:Steitz claimed that the 2009-2011 budget approved by Democrats created a $3.6 billion debt for Walker and the new Republican Legislature. Under the state constitution, the state budget has to be balanced. While some phrased the shortfall for the next two-year budget as a deficit, it certainly was not a debt. That comes with borrowed money that must be repaid.We rate the statement False.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/mark-pocan/wisconsin-state-rep-mark-pocan-says-gov-scott-walk/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/29/jim-doyle/gov-jim-doyle-says-wisconsins-projected-budget-sho/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke/,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/",,"State Budget,Wisconsin,Jonathan Steitz",,,,,

Chris Christie, state Sen. Sandra Cunningham made an impassioned speech about the consequences of eliminating monthly general assistance payments to New Jersey residents in need.The Hudson County Democrat was pushing to restore the $19.5 million that Christie cut from the state budget for the general assistance program. A part of the state’s welfare reform program, the general assistance program serves single persons and married couples without children.Cunningham, one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding, strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year 2012 cut the $140 monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount. She argued that taking away that money would lead individuals to turn to crime.The problem is that those monthly payments were no longer in jeopardy.PolitiFact New Jersey found that Cunningham was wrong to suggest the monthly payments were going down. In fact, the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels.First, let’s look at how Cunningham made her case.""I know when you look at it, you say, ‘It’s $140 per month. What good does it do?’ A hundred-forty dollars per month, if you don’t have a job, if you are trying to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach, is a great deal of money,"" Cunningham told her colleagues. ""It’s absolutely necessary.""If we don’t help these people, these people will find a way to help themselves,"" Cunningham continued. ""When we talk about urban area, and when we talk about impoverished people, we talk a lot about crime. Well, crime and poverty go together.""Cunningham went on, ""And in this particular case, if these people cannot find, cannot have something to eat, they will take to the streets and they will commit a crime. They will do that.""Before concluding her speech, Cunningham pleaded with her fellow senators: ""Please think about how some of our people really need it and how some of our people in this state are forced to live. Please vote for this resolution.""The resolution to provide that funding failed in a 24-15 vote.Now, let’s explain the general assistance payments.In fiscal year 2011, the general assistance program provided monthly benefits of $140 and $210 for recipients deemed ""employable"" and ""unemployable,"" respectively.The fiscal year 2012 budget proposed by Gov. Chris Christie included language to cut monthly benefits by $15. But the Legislature threw out that language when it approved the budget and Christie could not add it back in.David Rosen, legislative budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that removing that language from the governor’s proposed budget maintained the monthly benefit levels and the governor could not restore that language.Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the monthly benefits will remain unchanged in fiscal year 2012 because that language was eliminated.State funding for the general assistance program remains slightly below the fiscal year 2011 level, but that’s due to other program changes, Brossoie said. Of Cunningham’s resolution, Brossoie said, ""No change would have been made to cash benefits.""So, let’s be clear: Cunningham urged her colleagues to maintain $140 monthly payments that were not being cut.Cunningham told PolitiFact New Jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the Senate resolution would restore the $15 cut to monthly payments. She later acknowledged that the monthly benefits have been restored to their prior levels, but declined to comment further.But what about Cunningham’s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes?Two experts said general assistance payments won’t necessarily prevent crime.""There is certainly a link between poverty and crime, but it’s not so simple that a small payment would fix it,"" said John Roman, executive director of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute.The rulingCunningham strongly implied the state budget cut monthly general assistance payments, but the budget actually kept those payments intact. The senator also said losing that money could lead to more crime, but two experts said the payments wouldn’t necessarily prevent criminal acts.Cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored, but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments, when those payments aren’t changing at all.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.","/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/,http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/politifact_new_jersey_state_se_1.html",,"New Jersey,Crime,Poverty,State Budget,Sandra Cunningham",,,,,

The flier cites Uline, a national distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials, and includes this headline:""Bob Wirch helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.""So, did he?Uline describes itself as a family-owned company that employs 2,600 employees across the country. It was founded in 1980 by Dick and Liz Uihlein; Dick Uihlein is the great-grandson of the founder of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., one of Milwaukee’s famed beer makers.The company was headquartered in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border, when it announced n June 2006 that it would expand in Pleasant Prairie, a Kenosha suburb about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. Both Wirch and Steitz, a lawyer who is making his first run for public office, live in the village.Uline made big news in January 2008, when it announced it would move its headquarters to Pleasant Prairie and build a distribution center there, investing $100 million and employing 1,000 people by 2010. The company also said it would utilize state government incentives that were later calculated to be worth up to $18.6 million over nine years.The Wirch campaign flier led Dick and Liz Uihlein to issue a statement in response on Aug. 3, 2011.""We worked with a variety of state and local officials during the relocation process; however, state Sen. Wirch was not one of them,"" the couple said in the statement, noting they do not support Wirch’s campaign.That’s a strong rebuttal to Wirch’s claim that he aided in the company’s move.The statement also noted that a bill Wirch sponsored to help Pleasant Prairie with economic development -- which is also mentioned in his campaign flier -- was not introduced until July 2011 -- months after Uline had completed its relocation. The bill was ""by no means a determinative factor in our decision to relocate,"" the company’s statement said.When Wirch’s bill was signed into law in August 2011, Wirch said it would lead to 800 new jobs in Pleasant Prairie being created through a future expansion at Uline and the launching of a new biotechnology business incubator, according to the Kenosha News.But those 800 jobs are only projected, not already created, as the headline in Wirch’s campaign flier stated. Only some of the jobs are expected to come from Uline. And, in any case, they have nothing to do with Wirch’s claim that he helped Uline relocate to Wisconsin.When asked to respond to the statement issued by Uline, Wirch said in an email to the Racine Journal Times that he had toured Uline in 2010 ""and discussed with company leadership the importance of a strong workforce and well-trained workforce.""But touring Uline after it had relocated hardly equates to helping land the company in the first place.Also responding to Uline’s statement, Wirch campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Kenosha News that all references to Uline would be omitted from future campaign materials. ""Sen. Wirch is very respectful of Uline’s wishes and he has no intention of misrepresenting them,"" Walzak was quoted as saying.We asked Gillian Morris, another spokesperson for Wirch’s campaign, for evidence that Wirch helped Uline’s relocation from Illinois. She argued the statement Dick Uihlein issued was ""politically motivated"" since he had contribute to the anti-tax Club for Growth. That’s not even on point.The statement in question from Wirch is his claim that he ""helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs."" We found there is no evidence to back the boast.Uline brought roughly that number of jobs to Wirch’s state Senate district by the time it concluded its move from Illinois in 2010. But the company said it didn’t work with Wirch at all on the relocation. And the bill Wirch makes reference to wasn’t signed into law until long after Uline had relocated.Wirch’s claim of helping land a big new employer is not only false but ridiculous -- or, Pants on Fire.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on February 16, 2021 in remarks at a CNN town hall""If we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now.”By Louis Jacobson • February 18, 2021Editor’s note: After this item was posted Aug. 12, 2011, Wirch’s campaign provided us additional information -- pointing to a bill other than the one cited in the original flier as evidence Wirch helped bring Uline to the area. That bill, sponsored by Wirch, allowed for business expansion in the area of Pleasant Prairie where Uline moved.However, the bill was introduced Jan. 25, 2008 -- three weeks after Uline had already announced its relocation Uline’s chief financial officer, Frank Unick, would not comment on whether the bill played a role in the relocation.Pleasant Prairie Village Administrator Mike Pollocoff said part of the company’s expansion could not have occurred without the bill, which also affected other companies. But by that point, Uline had already committed to the $100 million relocation. So, we feel it’s a stretch to say the bill ""helped bring"" the company to Pleasant Prairie.","http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&district=22&display=bio,http://legis.wisconsin.gov//Senate/sen22/Sdist22.pdf,http://www.steitzforsenate.com/about-dave.html,http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Wirch+Creates+Jobs.pdf,http://bobwirch.com/,http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_Company.aspx,http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx,http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx,http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx,http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx,http://www.jsonline.com/business/29416029.html,https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1rkoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MUUEAAAAIBAJ&dq=uline&pg=2554%2C137063,http://www.pleasantprairieonline.com/about/history.asp,http://www.jsonline.com/business/29416029.html,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/96349074.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/journaltimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/5f/95f07712-be09-11e0-8747-001cc4c03286/4e39a61812c72.pdf.pdf,https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/sb144,http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/richard-uihlein.asp?cycle=08,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/club-growth/,/personalities/joe-biden/,/factchecks/2021/feb/18/joe-biden/joe-bidens-town-hall-mistake-about-inflation-index/,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2007/data/SB-417.pdf",,"Jobs,Workers,Wisconsin,Bob Wirch",,,,,

It's 30 percent bigger than it was when (Barack) Obama became president.""",,politifact,,"EDITOR’S NOTE: Upon further consideration, we have changed the rating on this item from Mostly True to Half True. The new analysis is below. Our previous posting is archived here.On the July 24, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to give some perspective on the size of federal spending -- a central factor in the current debate over raising the debt ceiling.   Addressing host David Gregory, Coburn said, ""David, everybody's talking about the symptoms of our problem instead of the real disease. The government's twice the size it was 10 years ago. It's 30 percent bigger than it was when (Barack) Obama became president. The problem is that we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits. But we don't have anybody that wants to do that without getting a tax increase.""   We wondered whether Coburn was right that the size of government has doubled over the past 10 years.   We began by looking at the size of outlays by the federal government, even though Coburn didn’t specify which level of government he was talking about. (Coburn communications director John Hart later confirmed that he had meant to refer to just the federal government.)We also decided to use outlays as our yardstick -- rather than, say, government employees or regulatory burden, as some readers later suggested -- since Coburn went on to say, ""we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits.""   Here are annual figures from the Office of Management and Budget for total federal outlays:   Fiscal year 2001: $1.86 trillionFiscal year 2002: $2.01 trillionFiscal year 2003: $2.16 trillionFiscal year 2004: $2.29 trillionFiscal year 2005: $2.47 trillionFiscal year 2006: $2.66 trillionFiscal year 2007: $2.73 trillionFiscal year 2008: $2.98 trillionFiscal year 2009: $3.52 trillionFiscal year 2010: $3.46 trillionFiscal year 2011 (estimate): $3.82 trillion   So, doubling the 2001 outlays over 10 years would have meant a 2011 figure of $3.72 trillion. Since the actual figure is higher than that, Coburn is right that the cost of government has doubled over the past decade.   In our initial analysis, we stopped there and did not adjust these figures for inflation. After readers pointed this out to us, we ran the inflation-adjustment calculations and determined that the fiscal 2011 federal outlay of $3.82 trillion was equivalent to $3 trillion in 2001 dollars. That produced an increase in federal outlays of 60 percent over 10 years. That’s still a significant increase, but short of double. We also calculated that government outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product, rose from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.3 percent in 2011 -- an increase of 39 percent, which is also not double.Despite our initial focus on non-inflation-adjusted numbers, we have since decided that our readers had a point, and that Coburn would have been better off using inflation-adjusted numbers. So we have decided to change our ruling.Meanwhile, we also looked at Coburn’s second claim, that government expenditures are 30 percent bigger than they were when Obama became president.   For this one, it depends when you start the clock. We’ll start with non-inflation-adjusted numbers.If you use fiscal 2008 as the baseline -- which we confirmed with Coburn’s staff was his intention -- then the comparison is just about right. Federal outlays increased by 28 percent between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2011, which is just below the 30 percent Coburn cited.   However, fiscal 2008 ran from Oct. 1, 2007, to Sept. 30, 2008, ending almost four months before Obama took office. The OMB only offers figures by fiscal year, so we can’t pinpoint a number that’s pegged precisely to when Obama took office.   If instead you use as a baseline fiscal 2009 -- which started on Oct. 1, 2008 -- then federal outlays increased by about 9 percent, or well below what Coburn said.   The inflation-adjusted numbers are a 22 percent increase if you start with 2008, and 3 percent if you start with 2009.Clearly, the shift of the calculation by just one year makes a big difference in the result.   We also considered whether Coburn intended to blame Obama for this spending increase. This was a tough call. Re-reading his claim, we don’t feel that his use of the inauguration of a new president as the cutoff point necessarily invokes blame. The entirety of Coburn’s comment encompasses government growth over a 10-year period, most of which was clearly under a Republican president, George W. Bush, and not Obama. And the inauguration of a new president is a pretty natural dividing line for making mathematical comparisons.   ""No one has a more consistent record of being a nonpartisan critic of spending than Coburn,"" said Coburn’s communications director Hart. ""He has been criticizing Republican and Democratic spending for many years.""   We agreed with this assessment, so we gave Coburn the benefit of the doubt on whether he intended to place the blame for government growth on Obama. And we stand by that decision.   So what's the bottom line? We don’t think that Coburn was entirely wrong to use non-inflation-adjusted dollars, but it would have been better if he -- and we -- had adjusted for inflation. Doing it this way still means there was a significant increase in government over the period he studied, but not as high as he had indicated. On balance, we have decided to lower our ruling from Mostly True to Half True.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/coburn/original/,http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43858388/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z1.xls,http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z2.xls,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"National,Deficit,Federal Budget,Tom Coburn",,,,,

Bob Goodlatte's) balanced budget amendment does not require a balanced budget.,,politifact,,"U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott recently urged House colleagues not to be fooled by the title of a proposed ""balanced budget"" amendment.""No provision of the amendment requires a balanced budget,"" Scott, D-3rd, said in a July 14 letter he sent to fellow lawmakers. ""All debate on this bill has been on the title and not the provisions in it.""A balanced budget amendment with no stipulation to balance the budget? Scott has made this claim repeatedly, so we decided to check it out.First, we should point out a number of proposals for balanced budget amendments are in the pipelines. Scott directed his statement at a resolution sponsored by a fellow Virginian - U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th.Goodlatte’s measure was approved by the House Judiciary Committee -- on which Scott serves -- on June 15. It calls for the president to propose a balanced budget each fiscal year. But there are two exceptions that Scott says give the resolution more holes than the Titanic.Scott points to language in the legislation that says, ""Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote.""""It doesn’t say you need to pass a balanced budget,"" Scott told us over the telephone. ""It doesn’t require it. It just says you need three-fifths vote to pass a budget that’s not balanced.""The Democrat also noted that the amendment would allow Congress, by simple majority votes, to waive the balanced budget requirement if the U.S. is involved in a conflict ""that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.""Scott, during a June hearing, suggested that Congress could exaggerate national security risks and use them as an escape valve against balancing the budget.So would Goodlatte’s amendment require a balanced budget? For an answer to this semantic question, we first turned to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed the bills in a June 21 letter to Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.In summarizing the bill’s provision calling for the passage of a balanced budget, the CBO said ""such a requirement could be overridden by a three-fifths vote in each House (in Congress)."" In other words, the resolution does require a balanced budget but allows that stipulation to be waived.Next, we turned to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that, along with Scott, opposes Goodlatte’s resolution.Robert Greenstein, the center’s president, said in a July 16 statement that Goodlatte’s amendment was one of several pending before Congress that ""would essentially require that the budget be balanced within the coming decade.""A June 1 letter to the House Judiciary committee, signed by 123 groups opposing Goodlatte’s legislation, said the measure ""would require a balanced budget every year, regardless of the state of the economy.""We also talked to Bob Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that has long spoken out against federal deficits. He said balanced budget amendments typically have an ""escape clause"" to allow extra spending. He said the three-fifths vote required for additional spending under Goodlatte’s bill is a high threshold.""The intent of Goodlatte’s legislation is clearly to establish a balanced budget,"" Bixby said. ""You could say in a very technical sense (a balanced budget) is not required if Congress has an escape clause, but of course that’s par for the course in a constitutional amendment.""Goodlatte’s measure would also set an annual federal spending limit at 18 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product and would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to exceed that threshold. In addition, it would require a three-fifths vote in both houses to raise the debt ceiling.Constitutional amendments are extremely difficult to pass. First they require a two-thirds vote in each House of Congress. Then three-quarters of the 50 state legislatures have to approve the amendment before it could become part of the Constitution.Let’s review:Scott said that no provision in Goodlatte’s balanced budget amendment would require balancing the budget. He makes a narrow argument based on escape valves built into the resolution.But a number of policy experts say the resolution does, first and foremost, require a balanced budget and imposes high thresholds for its exceptions. We agree and find Scott’s semantic debate misleading. We rate his claim Mostly False.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-fema-not-paying-hotel-rooms-winter-storm-victim/",,"Deficit,Federal Budget,Virginia,Bobby  Scott",,,,,

Shirley Turner (D-Mercer) has said is happening in Trenton, where municipal officials are preparing to lay off about 110 patrol officers and demote more than half of its police supervisors.The senator made that argument during a July 12 debate on the Senate floor about overriding a veto from Gov. Chris Christie and restoring $50 million in municipal public safety aid. That measure ultimately failed in a 24-13 vote.""You cannot do anything else if you don’t feel safe. And we know that in our urban areas today, particularly right here in the city of Trenton, which is not unlike most cities in the state, we have experienced an exceedingly high unemployment, twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state, and we all know that when you have high unemployment, crime follows,"" Turner told her colleagues.Turner continued, ""We have seen an increase in crime -- gang activity, child abuse, spousal abuse, gun violence. All of this goes hand-in-hand with a very deep recession.""PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check three points in Turner’s statement: is Trenton’s unemployment rate double every other part of the state; has crime in the capitol city increased; and does higher unemployment lead to more crime?We found that Turner was right about the increase in crime, but she overstated Trenton’s unemployment rate and research shows unemployment has a mixed impact on crime. Even the city’s police director said unemployment is not the sole reason for criminal activity.First, let’s talk about the city’s unemployment rate.In May, Trenton had an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent, which was slightly below the city’s 2010 average unemployment rate of 12.8 percent, according to data from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development and available at the time of Turner’s statement.Compared to 97 other municipalities with populations of at least 25,000, Trenton’s unemployment rate was below that of 14 towns and higher than the rates in 83 towns.But Trenton’s rate was roughly double or more than double the rates in only 13 of those municipalities, not ""every other area of the state,"" as Turner had said. Those 13 municipalities had unemployment rates of 6.7 percent or less.Turner acknowledged the mistake in a phone interview. ""I shouldn’t have said ‘every other,’"" she said.Now, let’s turn to the city’s crime statistics.Based on data provided by Acting Police Director Joseph Juniak, crime in Trenton increased slightly in the first six months of this year, compared with the first six months of 2010.The ""crime index"" -- which includes seven major types of offenses -- went up by 63 offenses, or nearly 4 percent, for the first half of 2011. Given the number of guns involved in 2011 incidents and the number of guns recovered this year, violent crime with weapons could rise even further this year, according to Juniak.So, Turner was wrong about how Trenton’s unemployment rate compares with the rest of New Jersey, but she was right about increasing crime in the city.But does higher unemployment lead to more crime?PolitiFact New Jersey looked at four studies and reached out to various experts. We discovered a similar conclusion each time: unemployment rates affect property crime, such as burglaries and motor vehicle thefts, but they have a smaller impact or no effect at all on violent crime, such as murders and robberies.Looking at data from all 50 states between 1971 and 1997, a study published in 2001 estimated that a drop of 1 percentage point in the unemployment rate results in a decline in the property crime rate of between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent, but only a half percent decline in the violent crime rate. That study was done by a professor of public policy in California and an economics professor in Austria.Using data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. from 1978 to 2004, another study published in November 2010 determined that a 1 percentage point increase in a state unemployment rate translates into 3,762 additional property crimes per year. However, violent crime does not respond to changes in state unemployment, according to that study.Naci Moran, an economics professor at Louisiana State University and one of the authors of that study, told us in an email that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases property crime by slightly more than 2 percent. But the impact of unemployment on violent crime is weaker, Moran wrote.""The upshot is that the claim made by that senator is supported by scientific research and that unemployment has an impact on crime,"" Moran wrote.Jay Hamilton, chair of the Economics Department at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, added in an email: ""If there is a general consensus it would probably be that when we find a relationship between the two it is weaker than most people would suspect.""Back to Turner’s statement:During a debate on the Senate floor, Turner said the unemployment rate in Trenton is ""twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state."" Due to the high unemployment, there’s been an increase in crime in the capitol city, she said.Recent crime statistics back up the senator’s claim about increased crime, but on the other two points, Turner’s statement is flawed. The city’s unemployment rate is not as high as she claimed. Also, studies have shown that unemployment can affect property crime, but it has a reduced impact on violent crime.We rate her statement Barely True.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that ""since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."" Sanders ended the tweet with his signature hashtag, #SharedSacrifice.A reader asked us to check his claim, so we did.First we contacted Sanders' office, but we didn't hear back from them.We then turned to Census Bureau data on poverty. In 2000, almost 31.6 million Americans were officially classified as having incomes below the poverty line. By 2009, that number had risen to 43.6 million. The difference? Exactly 12 million.So while the data for 2010 is unavailable, the most recent figures confirm that Sanders used a verifiable statistic.However, we see a number of issues that undercut Sanders’ interpretation and framing of the data.•  Both the number of people in poverty and the poverty rate have increased from 2000 to 2009, but the increase in the poverty rate hasn't been in a straight line. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans officially counted as in poverty -- started at 11.3 percent in 2000, then climbed every year until 2004, when it hit 12.7 percent. Then it fell for two years in a row, to 12.3 percent in 2006, before climbing for the next three years to 14.3 percent in 2009.However, it’s worth keeping in mind that the poverty rate in 2009 -- the year Sanders used as his benchmark -- is still lower than some of the rates in the 1990s. In fact, the poverty rate was higher in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and it barely missed being higher in 1991. The highest rate was 15.1 percent in 1993.•  Some people started out in poverty, rather than slipping into it.Every year, some American babies are born into poverty, and some newly arrived immigrants end up in poverty when they arrive on these shores. This complicates Sanders’ claim that ""nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."" Obviously, neither the impoverished infants nor the new immigrants in poverty ""slipped out of the middle class.""These cases probably represent a small minority of all Americans in poverty, but they can’t be ignored, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""There is no reason to think that all the people newly classified as poor were members of middle class U.S. families in the previous year,"" Burtless said.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021• Some people who slip into poverty may not have been living in the ""middle class."" Sanders has a point if you break down the U.S. population into three classes -- impoverished, middle class and rich.  And if Sanders defines the middle class as stretching all the way down to the poverty line, he’d be right that, on a net basis, ""nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty"" between 2000 and 2009.Defining the American middle class a fuzzy question -- and one that’s likely impossible to settle -- but we’re skeptical about the idea of extending ""the middle class"" all the way down to the poverty line. Both common English and public policy studies have long referred to ""the working poor."" It seems a lot more plausible that many of the people falling into poverty are members of the working poor than they are the middle class. If we’re right, this would make Sanders’ formulation an exaggeration.•  Sanders’ tweet misses that people move in and out of poverty America.The incomes of many Americans are volatile. Someone may lose a job, or get hit by an expensive illness, or lose a spouse. Then, a year later, the same person may get a new job, enjoy improved health or remarry -- and those life changes may well spell the difference between poverty and improved economic fortunes.""A proper understanding of poverty would show that many Americans do not stay poor for very long,"" Burtless said. ""They become poor temporarily, and then their incomes recover and they become non-poor.""Burtless said the number of Americans who go from poverty to riches essentially overnight is small (think lottery winners, pro sports draftees and the like). Much more common is to travel from below the poverty line to a level not too far above the poverty line.A different data set -- a Census Bureau study known as the Survey of Income and Program Participation -- provides a window into how many Americans fall into, and climb out of, poverty every year. This study is useful because it’s ""longitudinal"" -- that is, it tracks what happens to people and families across time.The study found that there were nearly 243 million Americans who were not poor in 2004. Of these, 8.8 million, or 3.5 percent, became poor in 2005, and 10.1 million, or 4.2 percent of, were poor in 2006.At the same time, the study found 28.1 million poor Americans in 2004, and of those, 8.8 million, or 31.4 percent, exited poverty in 2005. By 2006, 11.7 million of them, or 41.6 percent, were no longer in poverty.So, not only did nearly one-third of poor Americans exit poverty between 2004 and 2005, but the numbers of people leaving and entering poverty (not counting babies and immigrants) were exactly in balance -- 8.8 million out, 8.8 million in. (Because the SIPP data set is different than the official poverty statistics, the numbers don’t square exactly, but the official numbers do show that the poverty rate was pretty static in 2004 and 2005, falling only slightly, from 12.7 percent to 12.6 percent.)So on the one hand, fewer than the 12 million Americans he cited fell into poverty and stayed there. There was simply too much flux for 12 million Americans to have stayed in poverty year after year.On the other hand, many more than 12 million Americans experienced a taste of poverty between 2000 and 2009. But in most cases, that taste of poverty was temporary.So where does this leave us?On Sanders’ side, he used a solid number, and he’s clearly right about the underlying trend -- despite some ups and downs, there are more impoverished Americans today than there were in 2000, both measured by raw numbers and as a percentage of the population. But we think he goes too far when he suggests these 12 million Americans simply fell from the middle class into poverty. And he ignores the fact that as those 12 million Americans were slipping into poverty, many, many Americans were simultaneously climbing out of poverty. On balance, we rate Sanders’ statement Half True.","https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2011/tables/11s0710.pdf,https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"National,Economy,Jobs,New Hampshire 2012,Poverty,Bernie Sanders",,,,,

Its headline: ""New Report Shows Dems’ Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse."" It went onto claim that Sutton’s ""government spending spree"" ""delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China.""By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: ""President Obama’s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job.""PolitiFact Ohio thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, we’ll use his tweet.The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ""saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.""  It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.The blog item contends this statistic ""provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,"" and insists ""the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.""After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were ""based on partial information and simply false analysis."" White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries ""that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families.""The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects.Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure.Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A ""fact check"" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math ""satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.""""Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped form a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,"" the 2009 Associated Press item noted.The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually ""has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs."" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now.Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.""It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help,"" Zandi told TPMDC. ""This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.""The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but ""rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.""  Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply ""cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?""So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet that said  ""POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job."" The figure attributed to the president’s economists does not appear anywhere in the White House report.Rather, the Weekly Standard attributed the number to economists at the White House after it made its own calculations and conclusions.The methodology used to get that number was previously termed suspect because it lumps all costs associated with stimulus projects together as if they are wages, suggesting it would have been cheaper to just ""cut a $100,000 check"" to each person who found work as a result of the stimulus. Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on February 16, 2021 in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee.“There is a consensus among economists left, right, and center… that we can’t spend too much” on COVID-19 relief.By Jon Greenberg • February 18, 2021On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Boehner’s tweet (and the subsequent variations of his claim) as False.Comment on this item.","https://twitter.com/#%21/johnboehner,http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-s-economists-stimulus-has-cost-278000-job_576014.html,http://www.nrcc.org/default.asp?id=274&newsid=3000,http://www.nrsc.org/2011/07/white-house-economists-obama-brown-stimulus-cost-taxpayers-278000-per-job/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf,https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea,http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010183560_apusfactcheckstimulusmath.html,http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/07/republicans-falsely-claim-obama-advisers-burying-data-proving-stimulus-is-hurting-economy.php,http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/blogs/despite-white-protests-stimulus-still-cost-taxpayers-278000-job_576348.html,/personalities/joe-biden/,/factchecks/2021/feb/18/joe-biden/joe-biden-exaggerates-support-among-economists-his/,http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/07/house_speaker_john_boehner_say.html",,"Ohio,Stimulus,John Boehner",,,,,

What about that cheating scandal?The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written for years about allegations of widespread cheating at APS. Late Tuesday, the state released the results of a yearlong investigation that confirmed these reports, and then some.The test score success that rocketed Hall to national acclaim was the result of widespread cheating that may have gone on for a decade, the report said. The investigation implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, and more than 80 confessed. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined, they said.District leaders knew or should have known about it, the report said.    The scandal made national news. Time magazine called it ""likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date."" The Christian Science Monitor called it ""America's biggest teacher and principal cheating scandal.""APS even became a punch line on Thursday’s ""Tonight Show."" Jay Leno said it’s so hot he’s been sweating like an Atlanta student trying to take a test on his own.We contacted Franklin, who started her term in 2002, three years after Hall took office.She said she could not respond to our questions by deadline because she no longer has staff to assist her.""When my schedule is tight, I can't direct staff to handle one or the other of the requests,"" Franklin said.APS did not respond to our calls and emails.Undeterred, we switched on our Truth-O-Meter.  Franklin’s post listed five reasons why schools are better off after Hall:Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021The districtwide graduation rate increased by about 30 points.Graduates earned a record $129 million in college scholarships in 2010, up from $9 million in 2000.Philanthropic groups invested $160 million in APS.$1 billion was spent constructing and renovating schools.APS built 17 new schools and renovated more than 60 others.First, we looked at the district graduation rate. Georgia Department of Education figures show it jumped from 39 percent in the 2001-2002 school year to 66.3 percent in 2009-2010.But this dramatic increase, like the district’s skyrocketing test scores, may be fiction, according to the findings of an AJC investigation published Aug. 15.  The surge took place between 2003 and 2005. During those same years, the district removed thousands of students from its rolls -- about 30 percent of all pupils in grades nine through 12, the article said.That means the district no longer included them in the graduation rate.Many were recorded as ""transfers"" to other systems, at times without proof they hadn’t dropped out. One consultant estimated more than one-third of those who left were not documented.District officials denied they tried to get rid of low-performing students to boost their numbers, but their credibility is questionable. One of those officials gave investigators false information during the state’s cheating investigation, Tuesday’s report alleged.    Now we turn to Franklin’s claim about new infrastructure. APS reports construction projects to the state Department of Education, but not its costs, so we cannot confirm her spending figure.  Records do show that since 1999, the year Hall took office, the state Department of Education approved plans to build 15 new schools and update 61. This is very close to Franklin’s count.As for Franklin’s scholarship and donation figures, the school district is not required to report them to the state, so we cannot confirm them independently.   We do know that in light of the cheating scandal, there is reason to question whether APS won its donations fairly. APS received $125,000 in scholarships in 2002 as a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban Education because of overall improvements, including test scores, according to an AJC article.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated money because it thought APS was on ""the leading edge"" in ""effective teaching,"" a foundation spokesman told the AJC in 2010. A spokesman told the AJC that it will continue to support APS.How do we rule?The data Franklin uses to demonstrate Hall left APS ""significantly better than she found it"" is flawed.At least two of the statistics Franklin mentions are clouded by APS’ integrity crisis, and two are unconfirmed. That leaves school construction as the only clear-cut accomplishment of the Hall administration, and this does not outweigh the trouble the district now faces.  The district has to re-educate students who received high scores they did not earn. It must replace the 178 implicated educators. Key administrators may face criminal charges, and court battles could drag on for years. A district culture that Hall shaped over 12 years needs to be gutted and rebuilt.Confirmation of massive, widespread, coordinated school cheating is more than a bombshell. It’s the H-bomb of revelations. After Hall’s term, the district’s academic reputation, culture and integrity are in ruins. How can it possibly be better off?  We rate Franklin’s claim Pants on Fire.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/",,"Georgia,Education,Shirley Franklin",,,,,

Betty Sutton. It was also sent May 18.""Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out,"" it read.Sound familiar? The NRCC sent about five dozen news releases just like it May 18, each targeting a different member of Congress.Even though the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reject the debt ceiling increase May 31, the blame game is likely to continue. Lawmakers are trying to broker a deal before Aug. 2, when the U.S. Department of Treasury says it will be unable to pay the bills unless it borrows more money.Now back to the NRCC. PolitiFact Ohio decided its accusation against Sutton was Barely True. Republicans and Democrats share the blame.Tax cuts on higher-income earners passed under President George W. Bush and backed by Republicans played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan policy and legal analysis to Congress.  Some argued the cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. But PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts led to revenue totals that are lower than they otherwise would have been -- even if they spur some economic growth.Extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.   The recession hurt federal tax revenue as well. Add in the cost of the wars that began under Bush and continue under President Barack Obama, and you’ve got a good-sized debt, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues.Just two policies dating from the Bush administration -- tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs,"" the center said.   A federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation begs to differ. He said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities cherry-picked spending and tax policies that liberals dislike and blamed them for the entire problem. They could have easily scapegoated Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or any number of other programs with bipartisan appeal.We think it’s safe to say that both Republicans and Democrats are cherry-picking their data. Expenditures backed by both parties have helped put the federal government in the red.And now we focus on Barrow, who hails from Savannah, and Bishop, who is from Albany. Both are congressional veterans. Both are Blue Dog Democrats, or a group of moderates in Congress who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism. Both faced tougher-than-expected re-election races in 2010.  Both voted against raising the debt ceiling in the May 31 vote. And they both represent districts that Republicans think they can win.An NRCC spokeswoman cited various votes they made as evidence that Barrow and Bishop are spendthrifts. Both voted for the 2009 stimulus package, for instance. They also voted to raise the debt limit in December 2009 and February 2010.But as Blue Dog Democrats, Barrow and Bishop supported efforts to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years and eliminate programs that are out of date, inefficient or duplicate the efforts of another program, according to statements by the group.Barrow is chairman of the Blue Dog policy committee, which hammered out the group’s initiatives on balancing the budget and cutting spending.  Barrow spokesman Christopher Cashman argued that the NRCC cherry-picked from the congressman’s record when it argued he was on a spending spree. Those votes are only a tiny portion of the ballots he has cast during his congressional career. Cashman brought up more than a dozen other votes and initiatives as proof that his boss is no big spender.They included three 2011 votes for spending cuts. Bishop voted with Barrow in all of them.Also, Barrow and Bishop co-sponsored a bill that calls for amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget.Barrow and Bishop have voted for spending bills, but members of Congress of all stripes vote to spend money. That’s part of their job.Once again, the NRCC is guilty of cherry-picking. Whether you agree with their individual votes, the records of these Blue Dog Democrats show it’s unfair to say they’re on a ""spending spree.""Since these Georgians are keeping an eye on the nation’s credit card statement, we rule the NRCC’s statement False.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-fema-not-paying-hotel-rooms-winter-storm-victim/",,"Georgia,Federal Budget,National Republican Congressional Committee",,,,,

As part of his answer, he sought to provide some context about current levels of taxation, at least for the most highly compensated Americans.""You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix,"" Obama said. ""The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s.""We realize that Obama offered two different standards -- the lowest rates ever, and the lowest since the 1950s. We’ve decided to use the latter standard -- ""since the 1950s"" -- because the data is more consistent and easily accessible. (With one exception to fund the Civil War, there was no federal taxation prior to 1913.)The most basic way to look at this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what’s commonly called the ""top tax bracket."" This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately.Assuming you’re talking about the ""ordinary"" income a CEO or a hedge fund manager earns -- a key assumption, which we’ll discuss in more detail later -- Obama is pretty close to right, but not 100 percent.Between 1960 (when the ""1950s"" faded into history) and the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960, and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980.By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993.So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today’s top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today’s.)That’s not exactly what Obama said, but it's close.Now for the complications. First, hedge fund managers, who were specifically cited by Obama, typically don’t pay taxes on their income the same way other Americans do.The bulk of hedge-fund managers’ income is typically considered ""carried interest"" -- that is, their share of profits from the funds they manage. When a fund has capital gains and those gains flow to the manager, they are taxed as a capital gain, not as ordinary income. From a taxation perspective, the difference is significant -- taxation can be as low as 15 percent, rather than the 35 percent paid by everyone else (including other types of Wall Street managers).The 15 percent rate for capital gains has been in place since 2003, so tax rates for hedge-fund managers’ carried interest isn’t new. But 15 percent is the lowest it has been since 1950, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. So for hedge-fund managers, Obama’s statement looks correct.There’s another complication. One more way to analyze Obama’s statement is by effective tax rates. An ""effective"" tax rate is what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like. It’s always lower than the statutory tax rate, sometimes significantly lower.There’s data on this, but it’s a bit more scattershot and doesn’t go all the way up to 2011. But we’ll do a quick review of the data.A 2007 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez calculated effective tax rates for various income groups.For people whose income ranked between the top 1 percent and top 0.5 percent, the effective tax rate for individual, corporate, payroll and estate was 34.0 percent in 1960, 36.1 percent in 1970, 37.6 percent in 1980, 31.5 percent in 1990, 35.7 percent in 2000 and 31.3 percent in 2004.For those earning between the top 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent of the income curve, the numbers were 41.4 percent in 1960, 44.6 percent in 1970, 43.0 percent in 1980, 33.0 percent in 1990, 38.4 percent in 2000 and 33.0 percent in 2004.For those earning between 0.01 percent and 0.1 percent, the rates were 55.3 percent in 1960, 59.1 percent in 1970, 51.0 percent in 1980, 34.3 percent in 1990, 40.2 percent in 2000 and 34.1 percent in 2004.Finally, for those in the top 0.01 percent of the income distribution, the effective tax rate was 71.4 percent in 1960, 74.6 percent in 1970, 59.3 percent in 1980, 35.4 percent in 1990, 40.8 percent in 2000 and 34.7 percent in 2004.So for each of these elite income groups, the effective tax rates were at or near historical lows in 2004, though for certain groups, the effective rate was equal or slightly lower in 1990. Of course, this data is seven years old.Meanwhile, the 2010 Economic Report of the President included a table that showed ""that the effective tax rates that applied to high-income taxpayers reached their lowest levels in at least half a century in 2008."" The table (labeled table 5-8) had data running back to 1960 and for both taxpayers earning at least $250,000 and taxpayers earning over $2 million. The table mirrors the Piketty-Saez data in that the 2008 levels are at or near lows for the period, with only the early 1990s coming close.So where does this leave us? There’s some degree of uncertainty in making this kind of statement, since a very high-earning American’s tax rate can vary greatly, depending on the kinds of income earned (and what tax rate it’s subjected to) and the kinds of exemptions and deductions claimed on their return.Even so, when Obama said that ""if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s,"" he's close: Their tax rates are at or near the lows for the years elapsed since then.The top marginal income tax rates were lower between 1988 and 1992 than they are today, but otherwise, Obama is right. They were higher for the other years. Meanwhile, the rates that are used to tax carried interest for hedge-fund managers have been at historical lows since 2003. And effective tax rates for high-income earners were either at their lowest since 1960 or very close to their lowest (at least according to the most recent data available). On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-only-millionaires-paid-first-us-inco/,https://money.cnn.com/2010/06/10/news/companies/sloan_carried_interest.fortune/index.htm,http://elsa.berkeley.edu/%7Esaez/piketty-saezJEP07taxprog.pdf,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/economic-report-president-chapter-5r2.pdf,/personalities/tom-wolf/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/",,"National,Taxes,Barack Obama",,,,,

""Just a couple of quick examples: He said in 2009 early, ‘I will reduce the deficit in half by the end of my first term.’ Instead he’s going to multiply it by two, three, four or five.""We raised our eyebrows.So we checked in with Alex Conant, spokesman for the Pawlenty campaign, and asked him to provide some supporting evidence.Conant cited a comment by Obama in February 2009 at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit in which  Obama said he was ""pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""So Pawlenty is right about the first part.As for the second part of the statement, Conant pointed us to an estimate of federal debt from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that does official budget estimates.""If you look at this CBO projection of federal debt, (Table 1, Page 2), you'll see that the publicly held debt will double with even the most generous revenue projections,"" Conant wrote. ""If revenues continue to stagnate, and businesses do not grow, the debt will grow by even larger margins.""But Pawlenty said ""deficit"" -- not ""debt."" They are not the same thing. We inquired again but never heard back from Conant.Here's how they're different:The deficit is the amount by which the government’s spending exceeds its revenue for a given period, usually one year. The debt is the accumulation of the prior deficits.There are actually two major ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt owed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money that is owed to beneficiaries in the future.The ""debt held by the public,"" which Conant referenced, currently represents about two-thirds of the $14.4 trillion gross federal debt.If you're measuring the deficit, Pawlenty’s right that Obama hasn't yet fulfilled his promise -- at least according to the current projections for the end of his four-year term. The annual deficit was $1.4 trillion when he took office in 2009. In CBO's most recent projections from April, the deficit is projected to be $1.16 trillion in fiscal year 2012 and $901 billion in 2013.  So he's got to cut a lot more from the budget in the next two years to achieve the goal.But it was incorrect for Pawlenty to say the deficit will more than double. In fact, it is on track to go down, although possibly not as much as Obama promised.And even if Pawlenty meant ""debt,"" the facts don't support his claim. The publicly held debt is projected to continue growing -- from the $7.5 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $12.66 trillion in 2013, which is less than double.Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that Pawlenty may have erred by using fiscal year 2008 as a starting point. The debt and deficit both roughly double if he were comparing 2008 to 2012.The debt also doubles by the end of 2013 if you use, as a baseline, Obama's first full day in office -- Jan. 21, 2009 -- when the publicly held debt was $6.3 trillion.But even then, Pawlenty’s multipliers of ""three, four or five"" would be gross exaggerations.Marc Goldwein, an economist at the centrist New America Foundation, said it’s more important to take in the big picture, rather a small sample of years, for analysis.""The baseline should be -- what do we need to do to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path,"" Goldwein said. ""We can manipulate numbers however we want to show how deficits change, but the important thing is what deficits and debt are and will be.""Our rulingThere is some truth to Pawlenty’s claim: Obama made a pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. And he’s falling short so far.But there’s a lot more of Pawlenty's statement that’s wrong. The deficit, which should not be confused with the debt, is projected to decrease, not increase. And even if Pawlenty mixed up the words or used the incorrect fiscal year as a baseline, Pawlenty’s suggestion that the deficit could multiply by ""two, three, four or five"" is not supported by the facts.We rate Pawlenty’s statement Barely True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

Cain said he would not appoint one because Islam demands they follow Sharia law, above all others -- including the U.S. Constitution.  Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation.  Later, Cain denied saying he would not appoint Muslims -- a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants on Fire. CNN anchor and moderator John King asked Cain about the subject again during the June 13 Republican primary debate in Manchester, N.H.""Are American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christians or Jews?"" King asked.""There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, ‘American laws in American courts,’ "" Cain replied.Have there been instances in New Jersey and Oklahoma where Muslims tried to ""influence court decisions with Sharia law""?We turned to news accounts and court documents to address the issue.First, we’ll consider Oklahoma, where voters approved the ""Save Our State Amendment"" Nov. 2. It forbids courts from using Sharia law as well as international law when they make decisions. A judge granted a request later that month for a preliminary injunction that bars the amendment from going into effect. It is being challenged in federal appellate court.During a Nov. 22 hearing in Oklahoma federal court, state Assistant Attorney General Scott Boughton defended the amendment on behalf of the state. He conceded under questioning by a federal judge that he did not know of any instances where Sharia law was used in state courts, according to The Oklahoman newspaper.An Oct. 28 Los Angeles Times article on the proposed amendment found three cases that backers said demonstrate Sharia law is being used in U.S. courts. None of them took place in Oklahoma.A brief filed in federal court in support of the Oklahoma amendment did not assert that Sharia law had been used in Oklahoma courts. Instead, it listed one example from New Jersey.This brings us to Cain’s mention of New Jersey during the June 13 debate. In 2009, state Superior Court Judge Joseph Charles denied a woman a restraining order after she reported her husband repeatedly beat and sexually assaulted her. She and her husband are Muslim.Charles asked their imam during the injunction hearing how Islamic law applies to sexual behavior. The imam testified that a wife must comply with her husband’s sexual demands, but a husband was forbidden to approach his wife ""like any animal.""   Charles said he denied the restraining order in part because the husband’s ""desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited,"" according to the decision.The New Jersey appeals court ruled July 23, 2010, that Charles was wrong. His decision contradicted U.S. and state Supreme Court precedent on conflicts between criminal law and religion, the ruling said.  Let’s sum up.Cain was wrong on Oklahoma. Voters did pass an amendment to the state constitution that would prevent the use of Sharia law in state courts, but supporters found no instance where ""Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law,"" as Cain said.There was a New Jersey case in which a judge considered Islamic law when he denied a request for a restraining order.However, since the issue of Islamic law arose only when the New Jersey judge questioned the couple’s imam, it is unfair to accuse Muslims of trying to ""influence court decisions with Sharia law."" The judge raised the subject.We rule Cain’s statement Barely True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post""Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.""By Bill McCarthy • February 8, 2021Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Scott Walker's two-year budget proposal. Administration Secretary Michael Huebsch said security has been tightened at the Capitol in preparation for the crowds.It is a reprise of sorts.In February and March of 2011, tens of thousands of protesters rallied around the Capitol to fight Republican efforts to curtail collective bargaining by public employees.As the week opened, the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, issued a news release on Monday, June 13, 2011, saying its headquarters had been vandalized. The building was the site of an already announced protest at noon that day.The release stated: ""State budget protesters attacked the headquarters of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce over the weekend with pro-tax-hike graffiti on the sidewalk, and stenciled images of fists and Governor Scott Walker smeared on the building and statue.""That came under a headline of ""Pro-Tax budget Protesters Vandalize WMC HQ.""

We rated it Pants on Fire.

No report was filed.We asked WMC about their claim.""It’s vandalism,"" said Jim Pugh, the group’s public relations director. ""You can’t come onto private property and paint the building.""Pugh, however, acknowledged there was no permanent damage and said a crew was out cleaning the messages off the building and sidewalk that very afternoon.Additionally, the WMC press release was changed on the group’s website after our inquiry. Removed: The subhead about ""Graffiti strewn on Building, Sidewalk, Statue.""So where does this leave us?With the budget vote coming up and protesters back in Madison, concern about their conduct has returned. When the headquarters of the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce got hit with sidewalk chalk and easily removed stencils, the group labeled it a vandalism attack on its headquarters.

Paul Ryan promised to ""end health care for our seniors.""",,politifact,,"When some Democrats look at the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., it’s as if they’ve caught sight of a tiki bar at the end of a hot summer day.They aren’t envisioning fruity drinks with tiny umbrellas, but rather electoral victories. The Democrats see Ryan’s plan, particularly its changes to Medicare, as distasteful to voters and therefore an advantage for their party.As evidence, they point to Democrat Kathy Hochul’s upset win in a western New York congressional race that was dominated by Ryan’s Medicare plan. That special election was held May 24, 2011, less than two months after Ryan released his plan, which would convert Medicare into a ""premium-support payment"" program starting in 2022.  On June 6, 2011, Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was asked in an online chat how Ryan would affect elections on another level.Pasch is running in a recall election against state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who aims to retain a seat she has held since 1992. It is one of an unprecedented nine state senator recall elections that will be held in Wisconsin in July 2011.In the chat, which was sponsored by Blue America, a political action committee that says it works to elect progressives, a questioner asked:""I just read that (Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman) Mike Tate says that Paul Ryan will be a central focus in the recall elections. I hadn't heard that before. Will it work? Is it that connected in people's minds? Or is it too abstract for the average voter to make the connection?""Pasch, a second-term lawmaker who formerly worked as a nurse and nursing professor for 30 years, gave this response:""I think that Paul Ryan is the face of the radical plan to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. People across Wisconsin depend on and like Medicare. If you stand with Paul Ryan, you stand with the promise to end health care for our seniors. It's not just a policy issue, it's a values issue.""So, according to Pasch, Ryan promised to end health care for senior citizens.No health care? That would be one stiff drink to swallow.Before we assess Pasch’s defense of her claim, a little background.Ryan’s budget -- passed by the GOP-controlled House, 235-193, but defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, 57-40 -- would make dramatic changes to Medicare if it ever became law.As it exists now, Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. It helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs.Under Ryan’s plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those who turn 65 in 2022 or after, the budget office said, would get a ""premium support payment"" from Medicare. Rather than getting health insurance from the government, Medicare recipients would use the payment toward the cost of buying private health insurance.That’s a major change. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that future Medicare recipients ""would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""But when MoveOn.org declared that Ryan’s budget ""abolishes Medicare within 10 years,"" the left-leaning political advocacy group earned a False from us, given that Medicare would change but not go away.Other critics, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, haven’t gone as far, arguing instead that Ryan’s plan would end Medicare ""as we know it."" But when Wasserman Schultz also claimed that under Ryan’s Medicare, insurance companies could ""deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions,"" she got a False from our colleagues at PolitiFact National.Yet Pasch goes even further, claiming Ryan has promised to ""end health care for our seniors."" Not just Medicare, but ""health care.""Now to Pasch’s defense.Pasch’s campaign manager, Phil Walzak, argued in an email to us that, under Ryan’s proposal, Medicare recipients would ""lose a guaranteed set of health benefits"" because they would instead receive money to be used toward buying private health insurance. He also predicted that Medicare recipients would get fewer benefits even though they would be paying more for their health care. He cited analyses by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Academy of Social Insurance.For her part, Pasch herself was more measured in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin than she was in the online chat, saying Ryan’s plan ""is clearly a move toward not promising health care to seniors."" She went on to say that as senior citizens are forced to pay more for health insurance, they will ""start neglecting their health care.""It’s time for the tab from our political tiki bar.Pasch originally claimed that Ryan promised to end health care for seniors and now she says his Medicare plan is a ""move toward not promising health care to seniors."" That’s quite a step back from the original claim. Moreover, we’ve established that, although it’s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan’s plan, they would still have health care.At PolitiFact, we have a name for the drink that’s made by mixing false and ridiculous. It’s called Pants on Fire, and that’s what we rate Pasch’s claim.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021","http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122624839.html,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/11/moveon/moveonorg-says-proposed-house-republican-budget-ab/,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Assembly&district=22&display=bio,https://blueamerica.crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/blue-america-welcomes-wisconsin-heroe#comments,http://sandyforsenate.ngphost.com/,http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&district=8&display=bio,http://albertadarling.com/,http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/123516934.html,https://blueamerica.crooksandliars.com/,http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/0611/July_12_The_next_Ryan_referendum.html?showall,http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/156379-house-clears-ryans-2012-budget-plan-conservatives-want-more-cuts,http://www.startribune.com/local/122602309.html,http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx,http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx,https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf,https://front.moveon.org/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/11/moveon/moveonorg-says-proposed-house-republican-budget-ab/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-ryan-medicare-plan-w/,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"Health Care,Medicare,Wisconsin,Sandy Pasch",,,,,

Ron Kind, D-Wis., ""and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out""",,politifact,,"The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is dedicated to preserving the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, hammered Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., and 59 other House Democrats with a news release and e-mail on May 18, 2011.Kind ""and his fellow Democrats,"" the committee declared, ""went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out.""The committee was talking about government funds, not private credit cards.So let’s flesh out the committee’s claim, particularly with regard to Kind, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Herb Kohl.Our colleagues at the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper who run PolitiFact Ohio have already assessed the Republican committee’s spending claim as it pertained to Rep. Betty Sutton, D-Ohio. It’s the same claim made against Kind, a 15-year congressman from La Crosse in western Wisconsin.Here’s what PolitiFact Ohio found:Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of nearly $14.3 trillion.This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like, too.For our item, the question is whether spending by Kind and his fellow Democrats are the reason the federal credit card has been maxed out.PolitiFact Ohio went on to say that taxes are one part of the equation, spending the other. Here is there central analysis:Tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and that were adopted during the presidency of George W. Bush were extended in December 2010 for two years under President Barack Obama. While some economists say the tax cuts were needed to give the economy a kick, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits.Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the tenure of Bush, a Republican, and continue under Obama, a Democrat.The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities posits that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for over $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs.""That’s deficits, but it applies to the debt (formed by cumulative and mounting deficits), says the center. The ""Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies,"" the center noted on May 20, 2011.On the conservative side, Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said ""one could cherry pick"" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire debt problem. Unlike the liberal think tank, he said, ""one could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame.So, spending, as the National Republican Congressional Committee argued in its news release, contributes to the nation’s debt. But Republicans as well as Democrats were responsible for key expenditures. And, by bringing in less revenue, tax cuts also add to the debt -- and members of both parties put tax cuts in place, too.We asked the Republican committee for specific evidence to back its claim about Kind’s ""spending spree."" The committee cited his votes for Obama’s stimulus plan, a ""bailout"" plan for the states and the 2010 federal budget resolution. The committee also cited his votes in 2009 and 2010 to raise the debt limit, but those measures did not authorize spending.Kind’s staff, meanwhile, cited Bush’s ""two unfunded wars,"" in Iraq and Afghanistan, for contributing to the debt -- although Kind voted for that spending. His staff said Kind voted against against the Bush tax cuts and against another Bush spending proposal, which created the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.Where does all of this leave us?In a reference to the nation’s debt limit, the National Republican Congressional Committee said Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind and 59 other House Democrats ""went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."" It’s true House Democrats including Kind backed measures that contributed to the debt, but so did House Republicans. And the debt is a result of tax cuts as well as various spending measures, and both Democrats and Republicans supported such measures.PolitiFact Ohio rated the Republican committee’s claim Barely True.

People who need more health care would get a little more money.The plans would be sold on an ""exchange"" -- a virtual marketplace -- and would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. Medicare payments would rise but not at a rate that is expected to keep pace with the growth in medical costs.The Ryan plan was passed by the House in a near party-line vote, but it has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach.Wasserman Schultz hit this point hard in her Face the Nation interview. ""Like I said, the Republicans have a plan to end the Medicare as we know it. …"" she said. ""They would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, ‘You know what? You’re on your own. Go and find private health insurance in … the health care insurance market. We’re going to throw you to the wolves and allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions. We’re going to give you X amount of dollars, and you figure it out.’ And these are people who have paid for their whole life into the system, are counting on that safety net.""However, critics, including the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, argued that the Ryan plan doesn’t -- as Wasserman Schultz said -- ""allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions.""We decided to take a look.We’ll start by noting that the budget resolution is a non-binding proposal that has already died in the Senate. So any such plan can make promises -- like no barriers from pre-existing conditions -- without ensuring that those promises will be kept.That said, the language in the Ryan plan is clear: In 10 years, when the Ryan plan would kick in, anyone who is eligible for Medicare under today’s rules would be eligible to receive coverage under Ryan’s plan.Here’s the language from the budget that passed the House: ""Health plans that chose to participate in the Medicare Exchange would agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries — to avoid cherry-picking and ensure that Medicare’s sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries received coverage.""The Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- took this promise at face value when it analyzed the plan.In its description of the plan, CBO wrote, ""Beneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected.""So the resolution itself and the CBO are in agreement: Under the Ryan plan, insurers participating in the revamped Medicare program would not be able to deny you insurance for pre-existing conditions.When we contacted Wasserman Schultz’s office, a spokesman, Hari Sevugan, said that Wasserman Schultz stands by what she said. As supporting evidence, he provided a link to a paper by Paul Van de Water, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.The paper analyzes a Medicare proposal put together by Ryan and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. The proposal, released in November 2010, is similar in many ways to the Ryan budget proposal that passed the House.Van de Water (who did not respond to an inquiry for this story) wrote that under the Ryan-Rivlin proposal, ""insurers would surely attempt to shun enrollees in poor health (who cost much more), as private plans do today in the Medicare Advantage program.""We initially thought that the provisions outlined in the Ryan-Rivlin plan had been changed before the resolution went to the House floor. However, a look at the Ryan-Rivlin plan itself (a two-page outline) shows that the protections for pre-existing conditions are there, too -- in identical language.""Health plans which choose to participate in the Medicare Exchange must agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries, thereby preventing cherry-picking and ensuring that Medicare’s sickest and highest cost beneficiaries receive coverage,"" the Rivlin-Ryan plan said.So it seems that Ryan has been consistent on the question of pre-existing conditions.Is there still a way to get around those protections? Possibly. ""There are always ways for insurers to get around bans on pre-existing conditions -- put your office on the 8th floor of a building with no elevator, have no cancer specialists in your network,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. But he added that the same criticism would apply to the health care law passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by Obama. ""There's nothing uniquely structural to Ryan's proposal that would make it more subject to such evasion,"" Tanner said.Meanwhile, just because prospective beneficiaries couldn’t be barred due to pre-existing conditions doesn’t mean the Ryan plan would be a walk in the park for them.Linda J. Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said that a plan that shifts a greater share of costs onto patients -- as the Ryan plan would likely do -- could hit patients with pre-existing, chronic conditions the hardest. ""Big cost-sharing increases effectively shift more of the costs of providing care to those that use it most,"" she said. This would increase the pressure for insurers to cut back on expensive treatments, at least within the confines of the federal rules.Wasserman Schultz is free to criticize the Ryan plan on any number of grounds, but in her comment, she went too far. Both the budget plan that passed the House and its predecessor, Ryan-Rivlin, specifically noted that coverage could not be prevented by a pre-existing condition. It may be easier to say you’ll bar ""cherry picking"" patients than it is to put it into practice, but Ryan has made his intentions consistently clear. We rate her statement False.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021CORRECTION: This version of the story corrects that the president cannot veto a budget resolution.","https://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/FTN_052911.pdf,http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/dnc-chair-falsely-claims-seniors-could-be-denied-coverage-because-pre-existing-conditions-under-gop-reform_573108.html,http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/fy2012FullReportText.pdf,https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf,http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3429,http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/rivlinryan.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"National,Corrections and Updates,Federal Budget,Health Care,Medicare,Debbie Wasserman Schultz",,,,,

We’ll see if those goals are achieved sometime after 2014 when the main provisions take effect. Until then, all we have are projections.Sen. Rob Portman, however, focused recently on the here and now.  Even before the big provisions kick in that will expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, Portman says he is hearing from employers that their premiums are rising because of the law, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And those rising costs are making it harder for them to hire new employees, he says.""The legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire because it’s increased the cost of hiring someone,"" Portman told reporters on May 3, when he unveiled a ""Jobs Plan"" that included a proposed rollback of the health law.A few days later, Portman said small businesses have told him health care reform is already driving up their costs. ""People are telling me 15- and 16-percent premium increases,"" he said.Some provisions of the health care law did take effect last fall and early this year. Employers now must enroll employees’ dependent children, if the parents wish to add them, until they are 26 years old. New policies must pay for preventive care without tapping the employee’s deductible. And health plans cannot cap the lifetime value of medical care they will cover.Each of these might seem like it would make insurance premiums jump. ""It’s a basic principle of economics: If you add more things, it will cost more,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby.Yet conservative business groups and liberal advocates alike say that generally, those increases have been small. Adding a 24-year-old to your health coverage might require you to get a family plan if you only have individual or spousal coverage, so your employer would have a higher cost if it pays for part of your insurance. But young adults typically don’t use a lot of medical services and have very low health care costs.Similarly, full coverage of preventive care is only required for new policies.As for the lifting of lifetime limits on what a plan will pay, Bill Robertson, president of the Concord Benefit Planning Agency, a benefits consultant from Lake County, near Cleveland, told us that rarely happens now since the caps tend to be a $1 million or more. ""I’ve been in business 36 years,"" he said. ""I have cumulatively insured 50,000 people. I have seen one claim go above the cap.""Altogether, these new requirements added an average of 2.5 percent this year to the cost of employer-provided health insurance, according to modeling by the Lockton Benefits Group, a division of Lockton Cos., a large, privately held insurance brokerage.A study last fall by Mercer, an international consulting firm, put the average cost increase attributable to the immediate changes at 2.3 percent, with small companies (under 500 workers) averaging 3 percent and large companies (5,000 or more workers) 1.9 percent.Finally, the Ohio Department of Insurance, which regulates insurers and must approve many rate hikes, says premiums have risen about 15 percent, but only 2 to 3 percent is due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act.We asked Portman to elaborate on his claim. He mentioned a Congressional Budget Office study that, he said, predicted 800,000 fewer people in jobs as a result of the health care legislation.That’s after 2014, however, and the study did not actually state this number of jobs. Instead, congressional Republicans extrapolated the number -- variously cited as 650,000 or 800,000 -- during a hearing in which the CBO director was testifying. Separate analyses by PolitFact,FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post all found problems with the GOP’s interpretation. The CBO never said these jobs would be lost due to higher cost for employers.Rather, the CBO discussed a small reduction in the amount of labor in the economy, some of which would be caused by people leaving the workforce because they will no longer need to hold onto a job just to maintain their health insurance.PolitiFact ruled that a claim nearly identical to Portman’s, based on the CBO report, was False. Portman, however, told us that he based his claim on more than the CBO study. As he has said several times recently, this is what Ohio business owners are telling him. He provided us with names.Fredon Corp., a family-owned precision machining company in Mentor, has 78 employees and avoided layoffs during the economic downturn, said Alyson Scott, the chief financial officer. Now it plans to start hiring.Rising health insurance costs do make hiring a bigger challenge, she said. ""It absolutely goes to your overall expenses,"" she said.The company used to face annual premium hikes of about 10 percent -- increases the insurance industry attributed to inflation, an aging population and high use of medical services by all Americans. But Fredon was quoted a 22.6 percent hike for this year for the same Medical Mutual of Ohio coverage that it had in 2010.""They said they have no idea what’s going to happen in the future and they have to cover their costs,"" Scott said.Fredon’s insurance broker, Lisa Dimberio Nelson of Right Track Benefits, negotiated the increase down to 15 percent, said Scott, whose account was confirmed by Nelson.""What the carriers are telling us,"" Nelson said, ""is that it’s the mandates."" They say ""it’s not our fault, it’s the mandates,"" she said.Yet Fredon plans to expand its workforce anyway. So did higher premiums really have an effect?Absolutely, said Scott. It won’t prevent hiring, but it has caused the company to reassess ""how much we’re hiring, and at what stage.""We contacted Medical Mutual and asked about rate hikes necessary to cover the mandates of the Affordable Care Act.""At this point, health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing and it is too early to determine the future impact as the major provisions of the legislation do not take effect for nearly three more years,"" said Ed Byers, Medical Mutual’s spokesman. He was at a loss to explain why Fredon and its broker had the clear impression that a big part of its increase was due to health reform mandates.Portman’s office recommended other companies to us, too. Three of them agreed to interviews: PR Machine Works in Mansfield, Mound Laser in Miamisburg, and Rebsco Inc. in Greenville.Zoi Romanchuk, vice president of PR Machine Works, said premiums rose just 3 percent this year at her 55-employee company, but she expects a big increase next year. The company saw a 30 percent increase in 2009, which predates health reform. She said that other companies tell her they got hit with 30 percent and 40 percent hikes this year.Has this effected hiring at her company?""Not yet,"" she said.Mound Laser President and CEO Larry Dosser said premiums rose 20 percent this year, after experiencing premium increases in the low single digits for his 30-employee company. The company used to pay 100 percent of its workers’ policy costs but dropped its share to 90 percent, Dosser said.Ninety percent of Mound Laser’s work involves making microscopic parts for manufacturers in the medical device industry, which will face a special tax starting in 2013 to help offset health reform’s costs.The White House says the tax won’t hurt because the medical device industry will prosper from new patients gaining health insurance, but Dosser fears it could force his customers to move overseas, impacting his business.So is Mound Laser slowing its hiring?Not at all, Dosser said. It plans to grow to about 50 employees by the end of the year, ""because I refuse to be dictated to by those kinds of policies.""Then there’s Rebsco, a metal fabrication design and manufacturing company. It faced a 23 percent premium hike for insurance on its 20 employees, but held it down to 10 percent to 12 percent by raising the deductible. That means that workers, too, got hit with higher out-of-pocket costs, according to Tyeis Baker-Baumann, the company’s president.Has it affected hiring?It has in the sense that every new expense hurts, Baumann said. Her company could use two or three more workers, but ""we’re not going to (hire) at this point,"" she said. ""We’ll put that discussion off for as long as possible.""Why are employers under the impression that health care reform is to blame for double-figure rate hikes? Gary Claxton, vice president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and an authority on the insurance marketplace, offered this theory: ""If you were an insurer and you wanted to blame someone else, wouldn’t you blame the government?""So how do we assess Portman’s statement?We have the CBO report, which would point toward a rating of False.We have assessments from the insurance industry and regulators, which put the premium increases attributable to the new law around 2.5 percent.And we have the companies Portman cited.Fredon Corp. says it has not cut hiring, but is reassessing how much. Its insurer insists health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing.PR Machine Works is still hiring.Mound Laser is not slowing its hiring because that would be a capitulation.And Rebsco will delay new hiring because every new cost hurts -- including insurance.After looking at considerable amounts of data and studies, talking with industry and association experts and phoning people who run small companies, we found that Portman’s statement had some elements of truth. But there were too many critical facts pointing the other direction, too many misleading or confused assumptions about the cause of double-digit premium hikes -- and too few actual lost jobs or slowdowns attributable to health reform -- for the Truth-O-Meter to point in any other direction than Barely True.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

But officials also sharply rebuked the school, writing ""Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute.""Cuccinelli plans to appeal the fine. In a scathing written response, the Republican took exception to the department’s ruling and painted the investigation as shoddy.""It is not just that federal bureaucrats are engaging in Monday-morning quarterbacking — it is that they have had four years’ worth of Monday mornings,"" Cuccinelli said in a news release. ""Yet, in all that time, they have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to the police chief or the university president or to anyone else who had to deal with these events in real-time. Their investigation — if you can call it that — appears deeply flawed, and their indifference to the facts on the ground is shocking.""Is it true that no department officials visited the scene of the massacre before reaching their decision? We decided to check.Asked how the attorney general came to make such a claim, spokesman Brian Gottstein said that University Counsel Kay Heidbreder was the only member of the school’s policy group to speak who to anyone from DOE.  ""It was over the phone and DOE did not visit the campus or speak to anyone else,"" Gottstein said in an email. ""All Kay and the DOE representative discussed were procedural investigative issues.  He asked no questions about what happened [on April 16, 2007].""The easiest way to get started was to ask the Department of Education if anyone had visited Blacksburg during the investigation. We did that on April 29. Two weeks later, after asking a second time, we got a response.""We had several conversations, interviews and email exchanges with school officials in the process of conducting this review, and there were numerous opportunities throughout the process for Virginia Tech to provide input – most notably as the school did in its official 72-page response to our draft report,"" wrote Sara Gast, a spokeswoman with the DOE.  ""The lines of communication were certainly open, and they had multiple chances to respond and communicate with us throughout the entire process. However, because of the sensitive and legal nature of the proceedings, we did not meet with officials face-to-face,"" she added.Called for comment, Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker said that school officials did contribute to the report submitted to the DOE, but added that they were never asked to be interviewed or even submitted questions relating to the incident.   We should note that a state commission investigating the shootings interviewed 34 Tech officials before releasing a 2007 report that also concluded the university failed to issue a timely campus alert about the violence, which occurred over 2-1/2 hours. Virginia reached an $11 million settlement with many of the victims’ families. Two families have filed a $10 million suit against Tech officials that is scheduled for trial this fall.Let’s review.Cuccinelli said DOE officials never visited Virginia Tech while probing the university’s response during the 2007 shootings that left 32 dead. He said the DOE investigators never conducted face-to-face interviews with the Tech officials making decisions that dreadful day.A DOE spokeswoman acknowledged both points, although she said it did not taint the examination. She said there was plenty of communication via email and telephone.We’ll let others debate Cuccinelli’s opinion on the integrity of DOE’s probe.

526,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/may/08/steve-ogden/state-sen-steve-ogden-says-perry-advocated-liquida/,"Rick Perry ""advocated to liquidate"" the state’s rainy day fund in 2007.",,politifact,,"As state senators edged toward a party-line divide on the 2012-13 state budget, state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, questioned the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s past positions on taking money from the state’s Economic Stabilization Fund, better known as the rainy day fund.On the Senate floor May 3, Watson said to Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan: ""A couple of times, Gov. Perry has actually ... advocated for spending the (fund), hasn't he?"" Ogden replied: ""He's advocated to liquidate it.""Ogden added: ""I believe it was four years ago and that proposal was made and soundly rejected by"" the Senate.Ogden’s comment caught our attention because Perry declared in March he won’t sign off on a 2012-13 budget that taps any dollars in the fund.Some background: The stabilization fund, created in 1988, accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes; it also receives half of any unencumbered state revenue -- unspent dollars not reserved for a specific purpose -- at the end of each two-year budget period. Money has been taken from the fund in the past, including more than $3 billion during Perry’s tenure as governor.In 2003, lawmakers diverted $295 million in rainy-day dollars to launch an enterprise fund overseen by Perry to lure businesses to the state. Two years later, more money was taken from the fund to start an emerging technology fund overseen by the governor.Sharp increases in natural gas prices have boosted its balance, which was nearly $8.2 billion in January and is projected to be $9.4 billion at the end of August 2013.In March, Perry revealed he’d support taking $3.1 billion from the fund to shore up the current budget, which runs through August. However, Perry said, ""I remain steadfastly committed to protecting the remaining balance of the"" fund ""and will not sign a 2012-2013 state budget that uses"" it.Ogden has thrown the liquidation jab before.A May 3 commentary by Peggy Fikac of Hearst Newspapers quotes Ogden recalling Perry’s 2007 stance on the rainy day fund: ""Four years ago, the governor said we didn't even need one. And in fact, the governor tried to get us to liquidate it... his theory was, as I remember . . . that it's excessive taxation on the people, and why are we collecting all this money and doing nothing with it?""The article also quotes a Perry spokeswoman saying the governor did not propose to liquidate the fund. When we tried to follow up with Ogden, he declined to elaborate on his floor statement. Separately, we checked news archives, finding that during the 2007 legislative session Perry was willing to tap the fund to finance additional school property-tax cuts. In 2005 and 2003, Perry signed off on budgets that basically drained the fund’s existing balance, mostly to meet budget shortfalls. In the latter instance, the fund ended up with more money in it than projected, thanks to unexpected revenue due to higher oil and gas prices.A May 3, 2007, Associated Press report quotes Perry urging lawmakers to divert money intended for the fund to finance additional school property tax cuts. But Ogden spokeswoman Constance Allison told us Ogden’s liquidation comment was not referring to that proposal. Instead, she said, Ogden was talking about Perry’s 2007 desire to return rainy-day monies in the form of rebates to Texas taxpayers. The governor included legislation authorizing rebates among his emergency items for that session, according to a Jan. 12, 2007 press release from his office in which he said: ""To keep government fiscally responsible, state leaders need the authority to rebate surplus funds directly to taxpayers.""In his February 2007 State-of-the-State address to lawmakers, Perry said he was proposing a budget that ""grows the Rainy Day Fund to more than $4 billion"" while setting aside $2.5 billion more for property tax relief. His speech continued: ""One way to provide tax relief is in the form of a rebate. The appeal of a one-time rebate is that future legislatures don’t have to find the money to sustain it. However, the will of the Legislature may be to provide rate relief instead.  Either way is better than the alternative: which is having the money spent on more government.""According to a Jan. 29, 2007, Houston Chronicle news article, Ogden was cool to the rebate idea. Asked his opinion of it, he said: ""Not much . . .The big issue to me in this session is to make sure that we set aside enough of the surplus to guarantee that we'll be able to meet our property tax promises in future years."" Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst aired a similar sentiment.Neither the Chronicle article nor Perry’s formal messages say the governor wanted to empty the Rainy Day Fund to provide rebates. In an interview, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Perry did not call for depleting the fund then and now considers it prudent to leave the fund intact. He has, however, said he’ll go along with taking out $3.1 billion to cover gaps in the current budget, which runs through August.In the end, the 2007 Legislature took no money from the fund, according to a 2011 policy paper on the fund’s history by the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has urged the 2011 Legislature to maintain existing government programs through 2012-13 by leaning on the fund.According to the state comptroller’s office, the state later ended fiscal 2008 with more than $4.3 billion in the fund and closed the next year with a balance of more than $6.7 billion. End of story? Not quite. In a May 5 blog post by Fikac on the Houston Chronicle website, Perry acknowledged he advocated liquidating the rainy day fund — in 2005. ""I did,"" Fikac quotes Perry saying. ""If you’ll recall, it was during a period of time when we had major surpluses. I don’t see any reason to have huge amounts of money in a rainy day fund when you have just massive surpluses. If you recall, in 2005 we had a $10 billion budget surplus relative to the two-year budget before.""As for what he was going to do with the fund after it was liquidated, Perry said he didn’t remember the details.

The record does show that Perry’s rebate proposal got nowhere in the Legislature.It also shows that despite Perry’s avowed distaste for tapping the rainy day fund, he has repeatedly approved state budgets that effectively spent it all.

More specifically, that the United States isn't building them any more, while China is.It has become a regular talking point for the real estate mogul/potential Republican presidential candidate in recent press appearances. Here are a couple examples:""We are rebuilding China. I don't know if you know it. They're building bridges. They're building airports. They're building cities, brand-new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge being built in the United States? We don't have bridges being built. We have bridges that are falling down."" - Trump on CNN's State of the Union on April 17, 2011. ""When was the last time – if you go to China, as an example – bridges being built, massive bridges. When is the last time we built a bridge in this country, other than a little toy."" - Trump at a press conference in New Hampshire on April 27, 2011.Is the United States no longer in the bridge building game?We contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to get data on federal spending on bridges over the last decade. The press office prepared a report on funds obligated for highway bridge replacement, rehabilitation and maintenance for the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. The report shows a steady upward trend in federal spending (in other words, not including state and local bridge funding): from $4.8 billion in 2001; to $6.8 billion in 2008; and then jumping to $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a result of an influx of money from the economic stimulus package.It's not that the U.S. isn't spending more on bridges, said Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. It's that it isn't nearly enough to keep pace. Over the last 30 years, the number of cars and miles driven has doubled, he said, yet the amount of road and bridge capacity has increased just 7 percent.""We didn't build it, and they came anyway,"" Solsby said.According to an April 28, 2011, story in The Economist, America is lagging behind most of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of investment in infrastructure such as bridges.""Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4 percent of GDP,"" the story notes. ""Europe, by contrast, invests 5 percent of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9 percent. America’s spending as a share of GDP has not come close to European levels for over 50 years. Over that time funds for both capital investments and operations and maintenance have steadily dropped.""Moreover, the article notes, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that ""America needs to spend $20 billion more a year just to maintain its infrastructure at the present, inadequate, levels."" And that's doesn't include building new bridges.In its ""2010 Bridge Inventory"" report, Better Roads Magazine analyzed the state of the nation's more than 600,000 bridges and concluded that a ""worryingly high"" number of them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Politicians on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the problem, Solsby said. The dilemma is how to pay for it. States are financially strapped as a result of the recession. Federal dollars are stretched, too. The ARTBA would like to see an increase in the gasoline tax to fund more bridges, Solby said, but with gas prices soaring, ""Is that politically palatable?""""From one perspective, he (Trump) is right,"" Solsby said. ""Everyone else on the planet realizes infrastructure investments are a major shot of adrenaline for an economy. But it's not like we are not building bridges. We are. It's just slow.""Bridge experts we spoke with rattled off a number of major bridges recently completed or well underway. Among them:* The Hoover Dam bypass bridge, which opened October, 2010. The New York Times called it ""an engineering marvel and an acrophobe's nightmare."" The 1,900-foot-long bridge over the Colorado River gorge, connecting Arizona and Nevada, is the the seventh-highest bridge in the world and the longest single-span concrete arch bridge in the Western hemisphere. In other words, not just a ""little toy.""* The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a ""major seismic retrofit"" with a total project length of 8.4 miles. Cost of the East Span alone is estimated at nearly $5.5 billion. It is projected to open in both directions in 2013.* The replacement 1.1-mile Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River, connecting Maryland and Virginia, which was completed in 2008 with a capacity for 295,000 vehicles a day. * The I-35W bridge over Mississippi River in Minneapolis, replacing the bridge that tragically collapsed in August 2007, claiming 13 lives. A new, 10-lane replacement bridge opened -- at a cost of $234 million -- just over a year later. * The Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River connecting Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City. Completed last summer at a cost of $614 million, the 2,400-ton bridge span was shipped 136 miles via two barges.This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a sampling. Which is all to say: the U.S. is still in the bridge-building business. So Trump has overreached with his claims. But allowing for the possibility that Trump was exercising a bit of hyperbole to make a point about needing to prioritize infrastructure investment for things like new bridges -- an issue that data suggests is a valid and pressing concern --  we rate Trump's statement Half True.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021","https://www.economist.com/node/18620944/print,http://www.betterroads.com/category/bridge-inventory/,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"National,Infrastructure,Donald Trump",,,,,

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.""When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for,"" Obama told his supporters. ""So it's not on the level.""In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nation’s record deficits.Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obama’s critique of Ryan.With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We can’t fact-check the president’s opinion about Ryan’s message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the president’s remarks spoke for themselves.Let’s look at the votes.There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.All were big-ticket items.But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were ""unpaid for."" That’s Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.Obama’s claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasn’t paid for and ""cost as much as my health care bill.""Let’s break this into two parts.Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.Obama’s health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range.  Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.That is, Obama’s health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care law’s impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The CBO’s estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBO’s report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.That covers the details behind the president’s remarks. In this case, it’s important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryan’s take.Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obama’s citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.He disagreed: ""We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.""His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: ""Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.""On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that ""we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little."" He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.""Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president,"" said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bush’s war effort in Afghanistan nor Obama’s escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.So where does this leave us?The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.Obama got it right on Ryan’s support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or ""paid for"" by spending cuts or tax increases. That’s the main part of his claim.He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.That puts him at Mostly True.Featured Fact-checkDan O'Donnellstated on February 3, 2021 in in a commentaryNovember election data shows a “stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.”By Eric Litke • February 12, 2021","http://widget.newsinc.com/fullplayerwvars.html?wid=2190&cid=993&spid=23398484&freewheel=90078&sitesection=journalsentinel_pol,http://widget.newsinc.com/fullplayerwvars.html?wid=2190&cid=993&spid=23398484&freewheel=90078&sitesection=journalsentinel_pol,https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20054185-503544.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20054185-503544.html,about:blank,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/R000570/key-votes/page3/,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/R000570/key-votes/page3/,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/107/house/1/votes/116/,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/107/house/1/votes/116/,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/108/house/1/votes/182/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121606200.html,http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/108/house/1/votes/670/,https://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4808/11-20-MedicareLetter.pdf,https://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4808/11-20-MedicareLetter.pdf,http://www.kff.org/healthreform/8023.cfm,http://www.lewin.com/content/publications/LewinGroupAnalysis-PatientProtectionandAffordableCareAct2010.pdf,http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=426,http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=426,http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=2088,http://budget.house.gov/healthcare/,http://budget.house.gov/healthcare/,http://www.economics21.org/commentary/ryan-answers-obama,http://www.economics21.org/commentary/ryan-answers-obama,http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf,https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20026069-503544.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/us/politics/14obama.html,http://budget.house.gov/fy2012budget/,/personalities/dan-odonnell/,/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/",,"Wisconsin,Afghanistan,Deficit,Federal Budget,Health Care,Iraq,Taxes,Barack Obama",,,,,

Paul Ryan, people on Medicare will only have $15,000 from the federal government to spend on their health care.",,politifact,,"During the April 15, 2011, edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the liberal host and his ideologically diverse panel had an animated discussion about a proposal to overhaul Medicare that has been offered by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Ryan’s plan was included in a budget resolution that passed the House on a near party-line vote earlier that day. Republicans argue that bold proposals like Ryan’s are needed to rein in rising federal debt, while Democrats counter that the Ryan’s proposal for Medicare is too radical.Here’s what Maher said. (For purposes of clarity, we’ve cut a few interjections by other panel members.)""This Ryan plan for Medicare … is to … get rid of Medicare as we have known it, give seniors a $15,000 voucher to buy Medicare, which probably does not cover the health costs for a lot of seniors. Not to mention, what insurance company is going to want to sell insurance to a 75-year-old sick person? Well, what happens when you run out of the $15,000? You get sick and die. …""What happens to a person, if this plan is enacted, who uses the $15,000 -- which, by the way, if they’re in an assisted living facility, they’ll go through it in three months -- what happens to them? What do they do when they use up the $15,000 by this time of the year? What happens for the rest of the year? What happens to them? What happens? I’m just asking. ...""But this seems pretty black and and white. (What happens) if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?""A reader who watched the show asked us to check whether Maher had described the proposal accurately. So we did.We turned to Ryan’s official proposal, but we found its description too general to fully compare it to what Maher had said. So we looked instead at an April 5, 2011, analysis of Ryan’s proposal released by the Congressional Budget Office. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal matters.According to CBO, Ryan’s proposal would ""convert the current Medicare system to a system of premium support payments."" People who turn 65 in 2022 or later ""would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to help them purchase private health insurance."" (People who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare.)This premium support payment is similar (though not identical) to a voucher. With the payment in hand, beneficiaries ""would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange,"" CBO says. ""Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age.""The size of the premium support payment would vary depending on the beneficiary’s health status and income. The payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 would average $8,000 -- roughly the same as the federal government currently pays for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (when calculated by subtracting beneficiary premium payments from the government’s Medicare outlays). The payment to beneficiaries would increase annually according to the general rate of inflation and the beneficiary’s age. The premium support would be reduced for those in the top 8 percent of the annual income distribution.CBO says that the ""projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022.""That appears to be the source of Maher’s $15,000 figure. That’s an average for all Medicare beneficiaries over 65 in 2022, so there would actually be quite a bit of variation in the amount paid to various beneficiaries. But that's not the basis for our ruling.Our takeaway from Maher’s comments is that he believes the elderly would have $15,000 to spend on health care overall, and if that money were to run out, they’d be out of luck. As Maher put it, what would happen ""if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?""Problem is, that’s not an accurate portrayal of how Ryan’s plan would work.The average Medicare beneficiary in 2022 wouldn’t have $15,000 to spend on all health-care-related expenses. They’d be given $15,000 to purchase a health insurance plan. That plan, in turn, would pay at least part of their medical bills. That plan might have limits and co-pays and deductibles -- as current Medicare does -- but the money the plan could spend on any given beneficiary’s health expenses would not be capped at $15,000 per year. The $15,000 limit only refers to what the government will pay for the insurance plan itself.We don’t take a position on whether the Ryan prescription for Medicare is good or bad policy. There’s a debate to be had, for instance, over whether $15,000 will be enough to purchase a good insurance plan for Medicare beneficiaries, who are older and sicker, on average, than Americans as a whole. And according to CBO, the typical 65-year-old would be responsible for a bigger share of costs -- including premiums, deductibles and co-payments -- under Ryan’s plan than under traditional Medicare, due to such factors as higher administrative costs (including profits) for private plans and a slower increase in the government’s contribution over time than the rate at which medical costs increase.Still, we think that Maher’s basic description of what Ryan’s proposal would do -- which was essentially unchallenged by his fellow panelists -- misleads viewers who are unfamiliar with Ryan’s proposal. So we rate his comments False.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/paul-ryans-budget-proposal-passes-house-democrats-medicare/story?id=13384520,http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf,https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-blaming-biden-insulin-prices-miss-m/",,"National,Federal Budget,Health Care,Medicare,Pundits,Bill Maher",,,,,

They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases.""",,politifact,,"On the April 10, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., faced off against Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., over the federal budget.At one point, Van Hollen -- the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee -- criticized Republican spending proposals, saying that the party has targeted popular programs such as education and cancer research.At the time This Week aired, the details of the budget deal struck two days earlier were still emerging, so Van Hollen said he would ""reserve judgment"" on the language of the final spending bill. But he took a swipe at earlier, Republican-backed spending proposals.He said that ""the unfortunate part about this entire situation is that Mike and his colleagues threatened to shut down the entire federal government, which would have huge economic dislocation and disruption in the country, in order to pass a bill that, at the end of the day, doesn't create one job. … The Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases. And instead of focusing just on a narrow slice of cuts that they were demanding, we were able to expand the area of cuts and prevent some (in the budget deal). So that's good news.""We wondered whether Van Hollen was right when he said that ""the Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases.""Van Hollen's remarks were based on H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. We’re using it because it was a virtually pure Republican proposal: Only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it.So, would these programs be cut under H.R. 1? The answer is yes. Here are some of the key areas:• Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared to the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010.• Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared to the fiscal year 2010 level.• Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than today’s level.• Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Servcies, by a little under $1.1 billion.• National Institutes of Heath. NIH is the leading federal institution for conducting research on disease treatments. H.R. 1 would have cut its general budget back to 2008 levels, amounting to a reduction of $639.5 million from fiscal year 2010. In congressional testimony on March 11, 2011, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that the proposed cuts would mean that ""about half of the hundred largest clinical studies including those on cancer and Alzheimer's would probably be canceled.""When we spoke to Boehner’s office, they didn’t counter the notion that these areas would have been cut if H.R. 1 had been enacted.""In H.R. 1, we did cut IDEA, Head Start, Title I, Pell grants and NIH,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner. ""The cuts were across all accounts. Nothing was off limits.""Of course, Republicans have emphasized broader aspects of their bill. In a Feb. 12, 2011, news release about the introduction of H.R. 1, Boehner spoke generally about cutting spending and reducing the size of government, and didn’t mention education and disease research. The statement issued the same day by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., didn’t get specific, either.And in a Feb. 15, 2011, floor speech about the bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., didn’t mention those programs either. The specific programs he cited were elimination of previous earmark funding from fiscal 2010 and the rescinding of unobligated funding from the stimulus bill.None of this is remotely surprising -- in the abstract, education and disease research tend to be popular programs. One would expect Republican leaders to play up the more popular aspects of the bill, such as taming the deficit and reducing the size of government, rather than the less popular ones.By the same token, it's not surprising that Van Hollen highlighted the budget’s impact on education and disease research. It’s the latest incarnation of the old political war-cry that your opponent is targeting widows, orphans and other helpless Americans. But that’s not the whole story. H.R. 1 aimed to cut discretionary spending by $100 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education or disease research.We do think Van Hollen’s underlying point -- that cuts were made to education and disease research -- is valid. Reasonable people can disagree on whether such cuts are justified, but Van Hollen is well within his rights to point out that these programs would be cut under H.R. 1, just as Republicans are well within their rights to argue that the deficit is so large that every federal program needs to give up some funding. Ultimately, the voters will decide whose priorities hold sway.In our view, Van Hollen has narrowed the Republicans’ bill, which includes wide-ranging cuts, to just two popular programs. On the other hand, he’s right that those programs would take budget hits under the bill.

531,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/apr/11/stefani-carter/texas-rep-stefani-carter-says-beaumont-schools-chi/,Says the Beaumont school district’s superintendent is the highest-paid in the state.,,politifact,,"Discussing the state budget with three fellow freshman Texas House members and Texas Tribune editor Evan Smith, Republican Stefani Carter of Dallas said she sees room for cuts in the ""administrative side"" of the state’s public schools. As an example, she highlighted the Beaumont school district, where, she said, ""the superintendent is making $356,000 a year.""That prompted Smith, who interviewed the freshmen Feb. 16, to interject: ""In fact, among the highest-paid if not the highest-paid school superintendent in the state."" Carter agreed: ""The highest-paid. And it’s a very tiny school district. So, things are out of whack. ... Superintendents should not be paid a salary increase unless the voters say so.""We wondered if the Beaumont school chief’s pay is tops in the state.Carter’s chief of staff, Taurie Randermann, pointed us to the Tribune’s superintendent salary database, which indicates that Beaumont ISD leader Carrol Thomas’ base pay has been the highest in the state for the past three school years. This school year, Thomas’ salary is $347,834, according to the database, which was built with information from the Texas Education Agency.The Tribune’s database also calculates each superintendent’s pay per student. This school year, the Beaumont district has about 20,000 students, which means Thomas’ base pay is about $17 per student. Terry Grier — head of the state’s largest school district, Houston ISD, which has about 200,000 students — earns about $1.50 in salary per pupil. Overall, Grier’s $300,000 salary is the sixth-highest in the state, according to the Tribune database.The $283,412 annual salary of Austin district chief Meria Carstarphen ranks No. 10 on the list. That makes her per-pupil pay about $3 a year.We confirmed the Tribune’s salary information with TEA’s own rankings, current as of October 2010. Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the average annual salary for Texas superintendents is $119,080.But that’s the average in a state with more than 1,000 districts, about 80 percent of which have less than 3,000 students. Mary Barrett, assistant director of compensation services at the Texas Association of School Boards, told us that the group’s annual survey of superintendent salaries and benefits found that half of reported salaries are less than $105,000 and 75 percent are less than $138,000. (The association’s report is based on surveys sent to Texas school districts. This year, 79 percent responded. Beaumont was not among them.)How does Thomas’ salary compare with superintendents in similar-sized school districts?According to the association, the average superintendent salary in districts with between 10,000 and 24,999 students this year is $191,316.So, why is the Beaumont superintendent’s salary higher? In a Dec. 17, 2009, news article, the Tribune wrote that Thomas’ ""high salary may reflect his uncommon longevity: He’s been leading Beaumont since 1996 — a tenure tantamount to eternity in the hyper-politicized, high-turnover world of urban education.""As of this year, Texas superintendents had held their posts an average of five years, Barrett said.A Nov. 17 article in the Beaumont Enterprise said that when Thomas was hired in December 1995, ""the district was embroiled in a bitter battle among (school) board members who were split along racial lines, with student performance that was well below the state average."" TEA monitors had taken control of the board, according to the article.The article says that Thomas’ initial annual salary was $152,800. That compared with a 1996 average superintendent salary of $103,407 in school districts with 10,000 to 25,000 students, according to Barrett.Ratcliffe told us that the Beaumont district was willing to pay Thomas a high salary because the district was grappling with serious problems when he was hired. ""And he’s turned a lot of those schools around, so they’ve given him good raises along the way,"" she said.His contract, which the district sent to us, provides for a 3.9 percent annual raise dependent on a positive review from the school board. The average superintendent pay raise for this year was 3.3 percent, Barrett said.In a March 25 article, the Tribune reported that ""student achievement in Beaumont has climbed steadily for the past 15 years even as the state has moved to the more rigorous Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests and required more students to be included in the testing.""However, according to the article, Thomas’ salary and the school district’s spending have become issues in Beaumont, where residents in May will vote on an initiative to change election procedures for the school board.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 2, 2021 in an imageJoe Biden ""really did wipe away"" student loan debt.By Daniel Funke • February 4, 2021But there’s more to superintendent compensation than salary: The district leaders also receive perks — which vary considerably among districts — such as bonuses and car allowances. We wondered how those compare among Texas superintendents with the highest base salaries.That information proved tougher to get. Ratcliffe told us that the education agency doesn’t keep data on superintendents’ total compensation packages.The school board association tracks the most common extras, including allowances for cell phone or home Internet service, bonus payments, professional organization membership dues and car allowances, Barrett told us — but the data is only for use by association members. However, she did say that the top 10 compensation packages ranged from $338,000 to $443,000. Thomas’ salary alone puts him in that group.We attempted to conduct our own total compensation analysis, starting with Thomas. Beyond his $347,834 salary, Thomas’ contract shows that he receives a monthly ""supplemental allowance"" of $1,000. And Jessie Haynes, a spokeswoman for the district, told us that Thomas’ annual health and dental insurance benefits are about $6,800. The district also pays about $10,500 a year in premiums for his life and professional legal liability insurance and about $1,500 a year in membership dues to professional and civic organizations.That brings Thomas’ total package to about $379,000. How does that compare to his counterparts?Of the superintendents with the highest salaries in Texas, we were able to track down enough information to calculate nearly complete totals for Melody Johnson of the Fort Worth school district (No. 4 in TEA's salary rankings) and Grier of the Houston district (No. 6 in salary).Johnson, whose district has about 80,000 students, earns an annual salary of $328,950 and receives an automobile allowance of $600 per month. According to district spokesman Clint Bond, the district also pays $1,426 per year in membership dues to a professional organization, $4,475 for an annual disability insurance premium and $2,940 for health insurance. Johnson’s total: about $345,000.In addition to his $300,000 salary, Grier receives $1,200 per month for an automobile allowance and $400 per month for a cell phone, according to his contract. The district also pays $2,485 annually for dues and fees to professional and civic organizations, and this year, Grier will get $21,150 in supplemental salary payments. In January, the district paid $30,000 into a special retirement account for Grier, in addition to awarding him a performance-based bonus of $18,001 for the 2009-10 school year.Grier’s total, without health insurance: about $391,000.Our research also indicates that the total compensation package of Dallas school district Superintendent Michael Hinojosa is likely bigger than that of Thomas. Hinojosa’s salary of $332,832 — in a district that serves more than 150,000 students — ranks third on the education agency’s list of superintendent salaries. Add to that $450 per month for his cell phone, $23,464 in extra payments to the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and a $15,000 annuity, and you get more than $376,000.That doesn’t count professional dues, annual premiums for disability and professional liability insurance, performance-based bonuses,and health insurance — all benefits noted in Hinojosa’s contract. We requested that information from the district but had not received any answers as of press time.In the Austin school district, which has about 86,000 students, Carstarphen’s benefits include $12,000 a year for automobile allowance, a $15,000 annuity and $5,377 in health insurance. The district also pays $9,953 per year for a long-term disability insurance policy and $1,046 for a life insurance policy. And in August, Carstarphen was awarded a bonus of $41,500 for meeting performance goals for the 2009-10 school year. (She has waived any bonus tied to this school year.)Her total: about $368,000.Readers may note that none of these compensation packages approaches the $443,000 high-end figure mentioned by Barrett; we’re still awaiting information that would confirm which district is spending that amount.We checked in with lawyer Neal Adams, who, according to the Tribune’s March 25 story, has negotiated most superintendent contracts in the state since 1987 as general counsel for the Texas Association of School Administrators. When we asked him whether he knew of any superintendents with higher compensation packages than Thomas', he said he didn’t have specific numbers but that there were probably some.So, where does that leave us?On the Tribune panel, Carter said the Beaumont schools chief was the highest-paid in Texas. He does have the highest salary, although Carter misquoted the exact figure.But additional perks are a significant portion of superintendents’ compensation and cannot be ignored. In terms of total compensation, Thomas is among the highest-paid, but our research indicates that at least a couple of superintendents get more.We rate Carter’s statement Half True.UPDATE, noon, April, 14, 2011: After our item was published, we received information from the Fort Bend school district, in the southwestern suburbs of Houston, about the 2010 compensation package of Superintendent Timothy Jenney. It exceeded that of the Beaumont schools chief. According to the TEA data, Jenney’s salary of $260,339 ranked No. 24 in the state. In addition to that, according to his contract, he received $9,600 a year for a car allowance and $4,200 for a cell phone and other technology. The district paid about $35,000 that year for Jenney’s life insurance and disability income protection insurance. For the year, Jenney received a performance-based contribution of $36,000 to a retirement plan and a $26,000 supplemental salary payment, plus a $20,000 annuity payment. Sum total: about $390,000.","/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/04/facebook-posts/joe-biden-has-not-canceled-student-loan-debt/",,"Education,Texas,Stefani Carter",,,,,

Jim Jordan chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee, at an opportune time. The group’s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending.Among the targets: redundant social welfare programs. You might know these as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, but Jordan, of Urbana, Ohio, says there are a whole lot more than that.Jordan counts 77 federal means-tested social welfare programs, citing that number during an interview on the FOX Business Network and in backup materials to support one of his bills.""There are seven -- this is according to Heritage Foundation, we get a list of these -- 77 different means tested social welfare programs -- 77 different ones,"" Jordan said during a March 22 appearance on Fox.A week earlier he had introduced his Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients. And it would require federal welfare spending to return to pre-recession levels, with allowance for inflation growth, once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent.The sheer number that Jordan cited --  77 separate welfare programs -- sounded extraordinary, so PolitiFact Ohio took a look.Jordan’s office had a list with all 77 programs.Space limits our ability to include all here, and Jordan’s list is not online. You can find them in Jordan’s bill, or watch as they scoll across the screen on this Republican Study Committee video.They include Medicaid, food stamps,  Section 8 housing assistance; weatherization help for home owners and Pell grants to help students afford college. Jordan’s list also includes low-income home energy assistance, school breakfast for children from low-income families, the Job Corps training program for at-risk teens and young adults, and Head Start for pre-kindergartners.Most of the programs are geared toward people who fall below a certain income level. But Jordan’s list also included at least a dozen programs that don’t give federal money or services directly to the poor.Some examples: the Appalachian Regional Commission; urban development block grants; Title 1 education grants that help schools in low-income areas; empowerment zones, which typically benefit businesses as well as communities, and Americorps, which sends college graduates into low-income neighborhoods for social service work.Is this really welfare spending?Jordan’s office says yes. His bill defines ""means-tested welfare spending"" as ""any federal program that is designed to specifically provide assistance or benefits exclusively to low-income Americans."" Each of the 77 programs he cites were designed with that in mind.His bill also states that ""community and economic development programs targeted to low-income communities or populations shall be considered means-tested welfare programs"" for purposes of the legislation.We asked Mimi Abromovitz, an authority on welfare reform at City University of New York’s Hunter College of Social Work. In an e-mail, she said, ""To me, ‘means test’ means you have to be below a specified income level and the level varies by program."" She also referred us to a description on LibraryIndex.com, a reference site on social topics. It said:""Means-tested programs provide benefits to those whose income and financial resources meet certain requirements. More than 80 benefit programs provide cash and/or non-cash aid to individuals who meet certain low-income qualifications in the United States.""In case you missed that: ""More than 80.""Finally, Abromovitz noted a 2005 Government Accountability Office study that found that 50 percent to 70 percent of eligible people do not use these programs. But the question here is the number of programs, not their outreach -- and the GAO addressed that, too:""Each year through more than 80 means-tested programs, the federal government provides benefits and services to individuals and families with low incomes — just 12 of which account for as much as $330 billion in annual federal expenditures.""The GAO said 80. Jordan said 77.You could say he was just being conservative, but on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 17, 2021 in a Facebook post“FEMA is paying for hotel rooms!!!” for Texas winter storm victims.By Tom Kertscher • February 19, 2021Comment on this item.","http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/Solutions/wra.htm,http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/JORDAN_009_xml.pdf,http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/JORDAN_009_xml.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6g7tj7NLQU,http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/faculty/Abramowitz.pdf,http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/79/Federally-Administered-Means-Tested-Programs.html,http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05221.pdf,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-fema-not-paying-hotel-rooms-winter-storm-victim/,http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/rep_jim_jordan_says_federal_go.html",,"Ohio,Federal Budget,Jim Jordan",,,,,

Michael Downey, president of Council 94, the state’s largest public employee union, talked about the budget crises in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states, where governors sought dramatic cuts from unions and proposed stripping their rights to collective bargaining.In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker threatened to lay off as many as 1,500 state workers by the summer if public sector unions did not agree to roll back benefits and collective bargaining rights.There was a stalemate for weeks as Democratic legislators fled the state to block a vote. Finally, Republicans found a way to approve a bill stripping the unions’ bargaining rights for all issues except pay.Nee said national polls show that as a result,  ""public sentiment in favor of collective bargaining and in favor of the unions has actually gone up as these governors, I think, have overreached and gone too far and tried to destroy the labor movement.""We wondered if public sentiment in favor of unions is actually growing, so we asked Nee what polls he based his observations on. Nee had the union’s communications director send over some recent polls.A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published Feb. 23 showed that 61 percent of Americans would oppose a law in their state similar to the Wisconsin proposal stripping much of employees’ collective bargaining rights.  A total of 33 percent would favor such a law.A poll done by former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris and released Feb. 24, found 51 percent support Wisconsin Governor Walker’s ""reforms package,"" while 47 percent were opposed. Questioned on specifics, however, voters gave a mixed message. By margins of more than 3 to 1, they favored making state employees pay more for health insurance and pensions. But they opposed the governor’s efforts to limit collective bargaining by a margin of 54 to 41 percent.A Pew Research Center poll published Feb. 28 asked respondents whom they favored in Wisconsin’s collective bargaining dispute:  42 percent sided with the unions, 31 percent with the governor, 9 percent chose neither and 18 percent said they didn’t know.A New York Times/CBS News poll, also published Feb. 28,  found that 60 percent of Americans oppose efforts to weaken collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. (Only 33 percent of those surveyed viewed labor unions favorably, however, while 25 percent  viewed them unfavorably.)A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll published March 2 reported that 62 percent of those surveyed said eliminating collective bargaining rights for public-sector workers over health care, pensions or other benefits would be either ""mostly unacceptable"" or ""totally unacceptable.""The Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute that says it believes in limited government, published a poll March 6 showing that Wisconsinites opposed their governor’s planned cuts in benefits, wages and union bargaining rights by a margin of 51 percent to 46 percent.The response to eliminating bargaining rights depended on how the question was worded. When framed as ""limiting bargaining rights to help local governments,"" 47 percent were in favor, 50 percent opposed. When framed as ""eliminating bargaining rights to ultimately dismantle public employee unions,""  58 percent were opposed and 32 percent in favor.A nationwide Bloomberg National Poll published March 9 found 49 percent of respondents had a favorable view of public employee unions, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.In Rhode Island, Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy released a poll March 24 based on a random sample of 425 registered voters. The poll asked whether respondents favor or oppose taking away some collective bargaining rights from public employee unions. The response: 54 percent opposed, 40.6 percent in favor.  We searched for polls or experts that might counter Nee’s assertion. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had none. Nor did the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank.While all the polls Nee cited showed support for public employee unions and collective bargaining in the current disputes, none showed what Nee claimed: growing support since the Wisconsin battle.We learned from Nee’s staff that Gallup has been polling for public attitudes about unions every August since 1936.Those results showed that unions were much more popular decades ago, when a greater percentage of the private work force was unionized. Approval ratings ranged from 60 percent to as high as 75 percent in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1978, the approval rate dipped to 59 percent, where it has hovered until 2009, when it dropped to 48 percent. In 2010, public approval rose to 52 percent.The union poll always asked the same question: Do you approve or disapprove of labor unions?A more recent Gallup Poll, asked a different question: Whether respondents are more likely to say something negative or positive about unions. Results, released March 11, showed 34 percent would say something positive and 38 percent something negative.That poll may provide insight into how the public views unions in light of the Wisconsin labor dispute, said Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen, but Gallup won’t know  whether the public’s attitude overall has moved up or down until it does its annual union poll next August.So where are we? The annual Gallup polls show public opinion about unions in general is lower that it has been historically, although there was an upswing last year. Other polls do show the public seems to be siding with unions in the battle with Governor Walker.  And the public supports the unions’ rights to collective bargaining.Nee seems to be right that public sentiment favors the unions in the Wisconsin battle. And there is evidence that support for unions grew from 2009 to 2010. But Nee overreached when he said support has grown as a result of the Wisconsin battle.We rule his statement Barely True.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on February 5, 2021 in an interview on CBS“If you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage.”By Amy Sherman • February 10, 2021Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people.Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a ""tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves.""Said O'Donnell: ""There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point.""The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant.We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one.According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported.According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.""They typically build power plants where there are large populations,"" said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. ""Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand.""You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high.So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate.But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic.The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, ""the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory."" In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools ""appeared to be significantly compromised.""She's ""completely confident"" the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has ""extremely good communication with the licensees."" They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time.""We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information,"" she said.Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply.While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles.In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, ""they tend to put them in the outer suburbs,"" Milligan said.Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic.""Evacuations do save lives,"" Milligan said. ""They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well.""But back to O'Donnell's statistic. He said most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. That's certainly most. We rate O'Donnell's statement True.Featured Fact-checkStudents for Trumpstated on February 16, 2021 in a Tweet“Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party.”By Noah Y.

Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Roanoke, supported deep budget cuts approved by the GOP-led House on Feb 19. In a column posted on his website six days later, Goodlatte said the bill cuts $100 billion.""This represents the largest discretionary spending cut in history,"" Goodlatte said.Kathryn Rexrode, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, said her boss’ statement has been widely uttered by interest groups and members of Congress, including Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.We wondered if the cuts would be truly historic.First, an important detail: The $100 billion figure that Goodlatte and other Republicans are using represents the amount the House would ax from President Barack Obama’s 2011 budget proposal. Budget analysts from conservative and liberal organizations told us it is more meaningful to say the House proposal would cut spending by $61 billion, which is the amount it would excise from the 2010 federal budget.The Senate, by contrast, wants to pare $10.5 billion from last year’s budget.So our goal is to see whether U.S. discretionary spending was ever reduced by more than $61 billion from one budget to the next.Discretionary spending is the money the federal government pays out through a dozen or so appropriation bills Congress approves each year. It adds up to about 40 percent of the national budget  and includes a variety of services such as defense, law enforcement, transportation and national parks.If you’re curious, non-discretionary spending largely refers to three benefit programs Congress is required to fund at certain levels: social security, Medicare and Medicaid.We didn’t go back to the 1st Congress in 1789 to determine whether the proposed spending cut is indeed historic. The annual federal budget did not exceed $61 billion -- the amount the House wants to cut this year -- until 1943.We analyzed spreadsheets from the Office of Management and Budget. To roughly compute discretionary spending each year since 1943, we took the total budget outlay and subtracted the costs of Social Security and interest payments on government loans. The nation began paying for Medicare and Medicaid in the 1966 budget so starting that year, we also subtracted the cost of those programs.The largest reductions came after World War II as the U.S. was returning to peace. Discretionary spending dropped by about $38.5 billion in 1946 about $21 billion in 1947 -- entirely because of defense cuts.There have been a few other years when discretionary funding has dipped by smaller amounts: in the mid 1950s after the Korean War and in 1965. The feat was last accomplished in 1996, when discretionary spending dropped $12.1 billion.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021All of those numbers are smaller than the $61 billion the House wants to cut this year, so Godlatte’s claim is technically correct. But the post-World War II cuts, when adjusted for their times and inflation, were far greater in magnitude than anything being considered today.The 1946 cuts represented a 43 percent reduction in discretionary spending and 1947 brought another 41 percent cut. In contrast, this year’s House plan proposes a 4.5 percent drop.When adjusted for inflation, the 1946 cuts equal about $438 billion worth of reductions in today’s dollars -- more than seven times the reductions in the House budget. The 1947 cuts come to about $207 billion in today’s dollars.One final point: While the post World War II reductions came from military spending, this year’s House proposal would shield defense from cuts.Let’s review:Goodlatte says the proposed House budget would be ""the largest discretionary spending cut in history."" The plan would pare $61 billion from last year’s discretionary budget.In terms of raw numbers, Goodlatte is correct. The closest Congress came to that number was about a $38.5 reduction in 1946 and about a $21 billion lop the following year. But the magnitude of those post-war cuts, when adjusted for inflation and the percentage of non-discretionary spending they represented at the time, far outstrips this year’s House proposal.Goodlatte’s statement is accurate but benefits from clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","http://goodlatte.house.gov/2011/02/putting-an-end-to-the-spending-spree.shtml,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist03z1.xls,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/",,"Federal Budget,History,Virginia,Bob Goodlatte",,,,,

In his Feb. 25 State of the City address, Leffingwell said that four-year terms are ""the norm in most cities of our size.""News to us.Leffingwell, who hopes to seek voter approval of term changes in 2012, later told us the change would result in one council election every four years, sparing voters from facing two council elections every three years as they do now. Also, he said, ""if you ask politicians who are serving two-year terms, they find themselves in constant campaign mode. Campaigns are very exhausting and very costly.""To back up the mayor’s claim, his office provided a spreadsheet listing 34 cities plus Austin and the length of each city’s council terms. Spokesman Matt Curtis said consultant Mark Littlefield looked at the nation’s 30 most populous cities drawing on city websites and U.S. Census 2007 population estimates.According to the sheet, 29 of the cities have four-year council terms, five cities have two-year terms--and only Austin has three-year terms.Four-year terms prevail in some of the country’s largest cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia; they’re also in place in San Diego, Denver, Oklahoma City and,  in Texas, El Paso. Four Texas cities--Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth--join Charlotte, N.C. in having two-year council terms, the mayor’s research says.Wondering if the other listed cities are comparable to Austin, we compared their 2009 estimated populations as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Austin’s estimated population that year was 786,386; the average population for the other cities was 30 percent greater, 1,019,849.The 10 cities with populations closest to Austin’s size ranged from Boston, at 645,169, to Detroit, at 910,921. Among them, Boston, Charlotte and Fort Worth have two-year terms, and the other seven cities have four-year terms, according to our checks of city websites and interviews of respective city officials.Twist: Leffingwell’s fact sheet shows Boston’s council members with four-year terms, but Ann Braga, the Boston council’s staff director, told us that’s true only for the mayor.So, 70 percent of cities close in population to Austin are represented by council members elected to four-year terms.

""There is a Congressional Research Service report that just was issued in February, and we discovered that secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation to fund the implementation of Obamacare. This is something that wasn't known.""Just in case you missed her point, she said the number ""$105 billion"" seven more times, and waved a sign that said ""$105,464,000,000.""Readers e-mailed us immediately, asking us to fact-check whether it was true.We contacted Bachmann’s office to ask where she got the number, but we didn’t get a response.So we turned to a February report from the Congressional Research Service titled, ""Appropriations and Fund Transfers in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).""The $105 billionTo explain the report’s findings, we should first tell you a little bit about how federal spending works when it comes to authorizations versus appropriations. Laws can either authorize money to be spent, appropriate money, or both authorize and appropriate. An authorization means it’s legally permissible to spend money on a particular program; an appropriation actually supplies the money. The real power lies in appropriation.House members like Bachmann had hoped to stop the new health care law by simply refusing to fund it with appropriations. What they’re finding out, though, is that doing so won’t shut the money spigot entirely, since the law already included some appropriations and transfers from other sources when it passed.The CRS report detailed the programs that received funding in the bill. (Fund transfers work a little differently than appropriations, but the important thing for analyzing Bachmann’s comment is that they both provided immediate funding.) The CRS report doesn’t add up all the numbers, but we did, and we got $104 billion -- very close to Bachmann’s number. A few programs are funded contingent on adjustments for inflation, so the grand total can vary a bit.The largest chunk of funding, $40 billion, went to the state Children’s Health Insurance Program, to fund it for 2014 and 2015. (Soon after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Democrats approved funding through 2013.) A new Prevention and Public Health Fund -- a state-based effort aimed at preventing chronic disease -- got the second biggest chunk, $15 billion over 10 years. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation got $10 billion over 10 years to test payment and service-delivery models that might reduce health care spending and improve care.The ""shocking"" revelationBut is that $105 billion a ""shocking"" revelation -- something that ""wasn’t known"" and passed ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress""?Bachmann has a point if you look at the amount of media coverage the appropriations and transfers inspired. There was hardly any.Using a variety of terms to search the Nexis database, we found only one document that explained in any detail how the health care bill included appropriations and transfers -- a news release by the conservative Heritage Foundation that raised an alarm about abortion funding. The bill, Heritage said, would ""directly appropriate $7 billion over five years in operating funds for (federally qualified health centers) ... funds (that) would not need to be included in the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Labor and HHS.""But Bachmann didn’t say that the media failed to pay attention; she went further, charging that the provisions were passed ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress."" We find that contention questionable.We poked around the versions of the health care law that were up for consideration and found older versions that included both appropriations and fund transfers, some of which made it to the final bill. The CRS report Bachmann cited may have compiled the appropriated funding information into an easy-to-understand format, but it’s not as if the spending was approved secretly.Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense said it was no secret: the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis agency -- extensively detailed the spending in the bill.""I’m not saying that everybody knew everything that was in the health care bill, because it’s almost impossible to do that. But it was documented that the money was in there,"" Ellis said. ""Shame on them if they didn’t know that.""We asked experts in federal budgeting whether the health care bill’s use of appropriations in an authorizing bill was unusual. They said it was not.""Congress has routinely provided appropriations in authorization bills, for multiple years of availability, and has also routinely transferred funds from one account to another,"" said Roy T. Meyers, a former CBO analyst and now a political scientist at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County.We should also note that versions of the health care law were posted to the Internet for 72 hours before a vote was held. That’s not a lot of time, but it’s far from a secret process, said Gabriela Schneider of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that urges greater government openness and transparency.""At the time, we commended Congress for taking an unprecedented step and Speaker Pelosi for making sure every version of the health care bill was posted online 72 hours before consideration,"" she said.The process worked well, Schneider said, and House Republicans have subsequently adopted the 72-hour window.""It's a bill -- the text is public!"" said Alec Vachon, a former Republican congressional staffer who’s now a health care consultant. ""Is Congresswoman Bachmann saying there are no House Republicans, members or staff, who can read a bill?""One final point: Contrary to the implication of Bachmann’s comments, the spending provisions in the health care bill are not written in stone. ""Congress can always revisit the spending decisions, including entitlement and direct spending, of past Congresses,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican aide to the House Rules Committee.Our conclusionBachmann said that ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation."" She’s right that there’s about $105 billion of already approved spending in the health care bill that may be difficult to rescind. But that does not mean that the process was secret. While the pre-approved spending provisions didn’t attract media attention, they were in the plain language of the bill and did not vary dramatically from past congressional practice. And the bill was made public before the vote.

Ellis vented.""We’ve cut $109 million. I think we’ve done more than any local government in the metro Atlanta region,"" he told reporters after the board’s vote on Feb. 22.The second part of that quote piqued our curiosity. Has DeKalb cut more than anyone else?DeKalb’s communications director, Burke Brennan, explained and offered a slight correction. Ellis was discussing how much money he and the commissioners have cut from DeKalb’s general fund budget -- which pays for police, fire rescue and most county services -- since he became CEO in January 2009. DeKalb’s budget was $636 million in 2008. With the additional cuts adopted by commissioners last month, the general fund budget is about $529 million, county officials say. That’s actually a $107 million decrease, Brennan said, not $109 million.There are 73 cities, counties and towns in the 10 counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission. It didn’t seem fair to compare the budgets of, say, Clayton County’s Lake City (population 2,886) to DeKalb, which had a population of 747,274, according to the most recent U.S. census data. We decided, instead, to compare DeKalb to the similarly sized governments of Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta, which all have populations in excess of 500,000.DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett base their budgets on a calendar-year basis. Atlanta’s budget year begins each July 1 and ends June 30. Cobb’s budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We compared the last four budgets adopted by each government.In 2008, Fulton County’s general fund budget was nearly $671.5 million. The county’s budget has declined in each year to its 2011 budget of nearly $595 million. That’s an 11 percent decline of $76.5 million. Fulton officials told us they actually spent $35 million to $60 million less in 2008, 2009 and 2010.Gwinnett County’s general fund budget has gone up and down since 2008. In 2008, it was nearly $456 million. It rose to nearly $510 million in 2010. This year’s budget is $448.6 million, $7 million -- or 2 percent -- less than it was in 2008.Atlanta, like DeKalb, has cut its general fund budget significantly since 2008. The city budget was about $645 million in fiscal year 2008, which began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. The city cut hundreds of jobs from the payroll in fiscal year 2009, resulting in a general fund budget of nearly $571 million. The current fiscal year budget, which ends June 30, is approximately $559 million. That’s an $86 million difference that is 13 percent lower than fiscal year 2008.Cobb County’s general fund budget for 2008 was nearly $338 million. The county’s general fund budget includes most of the same services as the others, but there are some differences. For example, a portion of the property taxes goes specifically to the fire department budget, which is about $65 million for the current fiscal year. The fiscal year budget for 2011 is $328 million, a 3 percent drop from FY 2008.Since 2008, the numbers show DeKalb has cut more money from its general budget than any of the governments its size. The $107 million DeKalb has cut amounts to a 17 percent decrease over that time span. That is a larger percentage than the other governments. It appears CEO Ellis is on the money with this claim.

Leo Berman says that his proposed bill to require presidential candidates to show their birth certificates to the Texas secretary of state reflects doubts about President Barack Obama’s birthplace.""We don’t think the president was vetted, and it’s just that simple,"" Berman, R-Tyler, is quoted as saying in a Feb. 14 Politico article about similar proposals pending in some other states. ""I read different things that say he was born in Hawaii, and then I read the governor (of Hawaii) can’t find anything that says he was born in Hawaii.""A subset of Obama critics, dubbed ""birthers,"" doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president, and question the validity of his Hawaii birth document. That’s an old claim, shot down by PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org, which concluded that that a document aired by Obama's campaign is authentic. We won’t revisit that question.Still, Berman’s claim that Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie couldn’t vouch for Obama’s birth in the Aloha State was a new one to us.When we asked Berman about it, he replied: ""I just listen to the news, I don’t write it down. It’s been on several news stations that he (Abercrombie) said he was going to resolve this once and for all and when he tried to ... he couldn’t find anything.""Berman’s public comments have previously put him in ""birther"" company.In a Nov. 17 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news article, Berman said his proposal was necessary ""because we have a president whom the American people don’t know whether he was born in Kenya or some other place."" It’s undisputed, as posted on the White House website, that Obama’s late father was born in Kenya.But back to Hawaii: In 2008, in response to questions about Obama’s birthplace, his campaign released a copy of his ""Certification of Live Birth"" from Hawaii and posted it online. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama.Birthers, though, said the posted document was a shortened version of a birth certificate, questioning why the original, ""long form"" documentation of birth was not released.According to a Dec. 24 New York Times news article, Abercrombie, who was elected Hawaii’s governor in November, was angered by the persistent skepticism that Obama was born in the United States and planned to seek ways to release additional proof that his birthplace was Hawaii. ""It’s an insult to his mother and to his father, and I knew his mother and father; they were my friends, and I have an emotional interest in that,"" Abercrombie told the Times.Next, we searched for the reports that Berman mentioned. Online, we found numerous Web pages with the headline ""Hawaii Governor Can’t Find Obama’s Birth Certificate."" Many linked to a Jan. 18 article by the conservative WorldNetDaily.com, a locomotive on the birther train, that was based on comments that Abercrombie made to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.The WorldNetDaily story begins: ""Abercrombie suggested in an interview published today that a long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate for Barack Obama may not exist within the vital records maintained by the Hawaii Department of Health.""Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 28, 2021 in a blogFacebook tried to “shut down” the campaign to recall California Gov.

The governor only suggested his investigations to date had identified an unspecified listing or notation of Obama's birth that someone had made in the state archives.""In the Star-Advertiser’s Jan. 18 published interview with Abercrombie, the governor was asked about his plan to release more information regarding Obama's birth certificate. He responded that he wants to use information from the state archives about Obama’s birth. ""This is what our investigation is showing, it actually exists in the archives, written down,"" Abercrombie said.We called and e-mailed Abercrombie’s office about this and did not hear back.Meanwhile, we found another report that Abercrombie couldn’t find proof that Obama was born in Hawaii. On Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio Jan. 20, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Abercrombie’s, said the governor had told him that he had searched ""everywhere"" at Hawaii hospitals and that ""there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii.""The same day, Evans made the claim on Austin’s KLBJ-AM.Six days later, though, FoxNews.com quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. According to FoxNews.com, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but that Abercrombie did not return his call. ""I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor,"" Evans said.Meanwhile, The Associated Press reported that Abercrombie’s office had ended its effort to make public more information about Obama’s birth. The story does not say that Abercrombie had failed to find evidence of Obama’s birthplace, but that the state’s attorney general had told the governor that he can't disclose birth documentation without the person's consent. ""There is nothing more that Gov. Abercrombie can do within the law to produce a document,"" Abercrombie spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said.We wondered whether Abercrombie sought Obama’s permission to obtain more proof of his birth. The White House wouldn’t comment, but Abercrombie told CNN on Dec. 27 that ""we haven’t had any of those discussions.""Per the authenticity of the document posted online by Obama, our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out July 1, 2009, that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, had traveled to Chicago to examine the document and concluded that it’s legitimate.Janice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, told our colleagues that too much was being made of the difference between the so-called ""long"" and ""short"" forms. ""When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site,"" she said. ""That's the birth certificate.""According to a Nov. 1, 2008, FactCheck.org article, the ""long"" form is created by the hospital while the ""short"" form is printed by the state and draws from a database with less information. FactCheck.org also noted that the state’s birth record request form does not have an option for requesting a long-form birth certificate.The Hawaii Health Department maintains a Web page devoted to questions about Obama’s ""vital records."" It says that copies of vital records — which pertain to birth, death, marriage, etc. — can only be obtained by someone with a ""direct and tangible interest"" in the record. However, the public can view  ""index data"" based on those records in a department office in Honolulu or request it by mail.The page says that ""the index data regarding President Obama is: Birth Index // Obama II, Barack Hussein // Male.""Rewind: Berman didn’t pinpoint where he heard or read that Hawaii’s governor couldn’t find proof of Obama’s birthplace.

Scott Walker’s proposed budget repair bill, there is no question that teachers and many other public employees would pay more for their pensions and health care.The plan, especially provisions that would curtail collective bargaining rights for public employee unions, has drawn massive protests in Madison.As the debate was heating up, newly named Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus -- former leader of the Wisconsin GOP -- offered his support for Walker in a Feb. 18, 2011, e-mail statement. He argued sharing the cost in the face of a deficit was the least that state employees could do.""Gov. Walker is showing he, like so many Republicans across the country, has the courage to have the adult conversations our country wants and deserves,"" Priebus said.

We rated as Pants on Fire Walker’s statement that his plan leaves collective bargaining rights ""fully intact.""This item is about a different piece of the debate.Is Priebus right when he says Walker is asking ""everyone to tighten their belts""?Let’s start with the plan itself, which clearly treats some groups of public employees differently.For starters, the bill specifically does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers. Those public safety unions would continue to bargain for benefits under current laws, while other unions would lose the right to bargain on benefits and working conditions.Critics say those unions are being rewarded for their support of Walker, but this PolitiFact item found the picture is more complicated. The governor says the differing treatment is necessary, to ensure government can function in an emergency.Priebus’ office didn’t respond to a request to discuss his statement or what he meant when he said ""everyone"" is being asked to tighten belts.Some may read it as meaning everyone in the state, not just state employees.That, too, clearly is not true. The bill does not directly affect pay, benefits or negotiating rights for anyone outside state and local government.Indeed, Walker has pledged not to raise taxes and has argued the changes are needed precisely so individual taxpayers do not pay more.It is too soon to say, though, what will happen when the next two-year budget -- for the period starting July 1, 2011 -- is in place. Cuts in aid to schools and local government could push some extra costs onto local taxpayers, if the governing bodies choose to raise taxes and fees to recoup any loss in state aid.Let’s return to the original statement:Priebus argued Walker is asking ""everyone to tighten their belts."" But the proposal clearly exempts some public employee unions from any changes. Walker himself has said the differing treatment is necessary and justifiable.We rate Priebus’ statement False.Featured Fact-checkJim Steinekestated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetAssembly Republicans “have come to the table” and were part of “give and take” compromise on a coronavirus bill.By Eric Litke • January 27, 2021","https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-employees-co/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-employees-co/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-budget-repair-/,https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-budget-repair-/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-unions-supported-scott-walker-a/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-unions-supported-scott-walker-a/,/personalities/jim-steineke/,/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/",,"Labor,State Budget,Taxes,Wisconsin,Reince Priebus",,,,,

U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Thursday gave Florida lawmakers one week to see if they could work out a deal, but said that Scott would have to sign off on any agreement.In Tallahassee, lawmakers similarly were scratching their heads and wondering what's next.A veto-proof majority of the Florida Senate wrote LaHood asking for time to seek an alternative to keep the 84-mile-long rail project alive while suggesting that the state's Florida Rail Enterprise could manage the project without Scott's approval. State Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, suggested another option -- though in its infancy -- would be to create a public corporation that could insulate the state from potential cost overruns to build the train, or operational losses once the train is running.""We want to try to keep this alive,"" Simmons said.Scott vs. the LegislatureAs Simmons, Nelson and others work on one hand to circumvent Scott, they also continue to poke at the governor by saying he can't just do this unilaterally.The current state budget includes $131 million in high-speed rail development (line item 2094). That's part of the $300-million-or-so the state has pledged as part of the overall $2.7 billion rail project.Alexander's contention is that, without the approval of the Legislature, Scott must spend that money on high-speed rail.He has a point.State statutes prohibit the governor from ""impounding"" state funds -- meaning the governor cannot simply choose to not spend money budgeted. The governor has to veto a spending proposal, or accept it. And if he accepts it, he must spend the money for that purpose. The wrinkle in this case, of course, is that Gov. Charlie Crist signed the current budget, not Scott. But the budget is a law, which Scott is obligated to follow.Alexander made the same contention when it came to Scott's decision to sell the state two airplanes, saying the sale may have violated the law. The current state budget includes funds to maintain and operate the planes, and Scott just can't ignore the line item in the budget. Scott said the decision was completely legal.A second point: While most of the federal money for the rail project has not yet been awarded, some has.The state received $66.66 million in a federal grant in May 2010 to begin implementing plans for the high-speed line. Officials say about $26 million of that money already has been spent.""The bottom line is that he can't reject this money: It was already approved by another Legislature and another governor,"" Simmons said. ""It's like trying to veto a bill after it becomes law. It's too late.""Scott still holds most cardsThe money in play -- the $300 million in state funding and the smaller federal portion -- is peanuts when considering the entire $2.7 billion project.And that is where Scott has the upper hand, lawmakers, former state officials and transportation experts told us.He can veto future appropriations in the state budget, whether the source of the funds is state money or federal. If somehow, those vetoes are overridden, Scott can wreak havoc on rail plans in other ways.If a bond issue is required, he could try to kill the project through a vote on the Cabinet, or he could to hold up giving away the right-of-way to build the rail line. Or he could order his Department of Transportation secretary to fire people associated with the rail project.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021""He has the ability to direct agency heads and the ability to control expenditures that come into the budget over the next few years through a veto,"" said former state Sen. Dan Gelber, who was the Democratic candidate for attorney general. ""If the governor's dead set on making it not happen, he can make it not happen.""Even Alexander said the idea of rail is likely dead in Florida as long as Scott opposes it.""It may be a moot point when he's clearly trying to pull the plug,"" said Doug Callaway, president of Floridians for Better Transportation, a statewide transportation lobbying group.Though we think Alexander should have cited state statutes and not the Constitution, he is technically right that Scott is required to spend money in the state budget the way it is appropriated. That means the Legislature could play a game of chicken, forcing Scott to spend the $131 million in the 2010-11 budget, and maybe the remaining $170 or so million of state funds, and maybe even the $66.66 million in federal money.But getting him to spend the necessary money beyond that, all the federal and state money actually needed to complete the rail program, is a much taller order. And when it comes to the outcome of rail in Florida -- at least when it comes to the Florida Legislature -- that is today a much more important point. That's the context that gives Scott the upper hand. We rate this statement Half True.","http://miamiherald.typepad.com/files/2-17-11-letter-to-lahood-from-florida-senators.pdf,http://archive.flsenate.gov/data/session/2010/House/bills/amendments/pdf/hb5001e1561933.pdf,http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0200-0299/0216/Sections/0216.195.html,http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/jd-dear-gov-i-think-you-broke-law,https://flhsr.squarespace.com/storage/resources/funding-applications/aug-2010/HSR_SOW_1_grant_agreement.pdf,/personalities/viral-image/,/factchecks/2021/feb/10/viral-image/photo-shows-tampa-mayor-maskless-september-not-sup/",,"Ethics,State Budget,Transportation,Florida,J.D.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for courting the tea party movement. First, Uygur showed video of Hatch saying that he, like the tea party, was opposed to the health care law.""I was the one who raised the issue about the job-killing employer mandate, and of course the unconstitutional employee mandate,"" Hatch said. ""I've been all over the world for our country. Everywhere we go, people have always been amazed by America. And yet, we're in danger of losing the greatest country in the world. So we've got to fight back.""""Here's what I'm amazed by -- Orrin Hatch,"" Uygur said. ""You're going to tell me you're tea party? There's no one who's more Republican establishment than Orrin Hatch, who's been there for approximately 800 years. ... By the way, did you hear him putting dirt on the mandate? He said, oh, I can't put a mandate. I'm totally against that. Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? ... It's unbelievable.""We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years. (Hatch was elected in 1976, not 1210.) But we were interested in Uygur's comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate. We wondered if that were actually the case, so we decided to check it out.Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups.To counter that, the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls. Chafee's plan, one of several Republican alternatives, created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies. It also required everyone to buy insurance -- an individual mandate.Chafee's plan was backed by a group of Republican senators, including Hatch, according to news reports from the time. When the plan was formally introduced as legislation, Hatch was one of the co-sponsors. Two other current senators also co-sponsored the plan: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.We examined the old legislation, which we found in the THOMAS legislative database. The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law. The main difference is how the fines work for those who don't buy insurance. The new law sets a dollar amount; the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.We contacted Hatch's office to ask for an explanation for Hatch's change of position, but we didn't hear back. Last year, Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who had also co-sponsored the plan. Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993, backing away from policies on health care they once supported.Uygur asked, ""Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate?"" We didn't, but we checked the record. Hatch was the co-sponsor of a Republican-backed bill that included an individual mandate. We rate Uygur's statement True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

PolitiFact rated the claim as Half True.GM had squared its government loans, but loans were only a fraction of more than $52 billion that the U.S. Treasury had committed to GM through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Most of the government's GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the General Motors Co., the new company that emerged from bankruptcy.While several economists told PolitiFact the repayment was undeniably a sign of progress, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government would end up losing $34 billion in TARP money extended to the automotive industry and auto finance companies. The CBO didn't break out how much of that was tied to GM, but GM received the largest portion of the total $85 billion.By last fall, however, the Treasury Department had revised its loss on the bailout downward, to $17 billion. Treasury officials declared the bailout a success.But declarations of success, for the bailout or for GM, were not unanimous.""I'm not sure we can determine one year later that General Motors is successful,"" Rep. Jim Renacci said on the  ""Sound of Ideas"" on WCPN 90.3 FM. He said, ""I think that for the company to pay back everything it owes, it would have to sell its shares at $143 a share . . . where the highest value of a General Motors share ever was $43, $44, $46, whatever the dollars were...""PolitiFact Ohio asked the staff of the 16th District Republican about the underpinning of his numbers. They referred us to a blog posting that cited an analysis from last August by CNBC auto reporter Phil LeBeau, ""which states that for the federal government to recover its current net TARP outlays of $43 billion, each (GM) share would have to yield about $143 for the government to be repaid.""That figure was cited by other reporters, too, about that time, as GM filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock that was projected for October.But events overtook the $143 estimate. GM kept altering several factors in its IPO, and by the time it occurred last November, analysts listed a payback figure in the low $50 range. (By then, CNBC had taken down the LeBeau’s posted analysis from its website.)The government sold part of its 61 percent stake in GM during the IPO in November, raising $13.5 billion and reducing its share in the company to 33 percent. Treasury also swapped some secondary shares, bringing in another $2.1 billion.Technically -- and it's an important financial distinction to make -- the automaker does not owe the government anything. GM repaid the government by giving it the bulk of its stock -- leaving it up to Treasury to get a good return on investment. Given the rest of his statement, we think Renacci was talking about the government breaking even on that investment, not GM repaying the government.The government’s stake in GM stands at $26.4 billion. Divide that by Treasury's 500 million stock shares and you get about $53 a share -- the price Treasury would have get to break even on the bailout. The Congressional Oversight Panel lists the break-even price as $54.28.Renacci's staff told us that the record high for GM shares was $40.85, even lower than the congressman stated,  in 1999. But according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, and according to the oversight panel, GM's peak stock price was above $93 in April 2000.Those figures are for the old GM that sought bankruptcy protection and reorganized. Stock prices for the new General Motors Co. closed at $36.70 on Feb. 7.The senior Treasury official who oversees TARP told the Congressional Oversight Committee that the government hopes to sell the rest of its stake in GM within the next two years.Financier Steven Rattner, who was dubbed the administration's ""car czar"" as head of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, thinks taxpayers still could break even if Treasury is a little patient"" and holds its stock longer.Selling the stock at recent non-peak levels, the government would lose around $7 billion on the entire GM bailout.So where does that leave us?Renacci relied on an outdated projection of the stock price needed for the government to fully recover its assistance to GM. The ""break-even"" price really is much closer to the current stock price than were initial projections. And Treasury's current loss level of $7 billion is less than half the $17 billion projected by Treasury last fall, when it declared the bailout a success.And the congressman is way off the mark with his citation of GM’s highest-ever stock price.Whether the new GM can be viewed as successful is a point we leave up for debate. But as to Renacci’s claim about GM stock and the government recouping its TARP investment, we rate the statement False.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021","/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Ohio,Economy,Federal Budget,Jim Renacci",,,,,

The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride.The honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee.For three decades, the South’s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil.  Phil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He’s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie ""Groundhog Day.""On Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday’s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early.But should you really trust Phil? Beau’s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil’s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets.  Does Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog?PolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all.For the scoop on Beau’s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn’s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named ""Weathering Heights."" For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General’s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2.Beau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011.Sadly, Phil’s staff has not tracked their groundhog’s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is ""incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent,"" said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.  Wednesday was Punxsutawney’s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather.Phil’s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere.When Phil’s really wrong, Johnston added, it’s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation.""People complain and tell us we’re just making it up as we go along,"" Johnston said, ""but after 125 years of doing it, we don’t need to.""Before we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather.Really. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show ""no predictive skill."" (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.)Or, more bluntly, ""you can’t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather,"" said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC’s report.  It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent.True, but that won’t stop us. Our groundhog’s honor is at stake.Since the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010.We defined ""early spring"" as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog’s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown.The NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away.We found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil’s rate was 30 percent.Beau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney’s right 40 percent of the time.By our analysis, Beau’s staff overestimated his success, but he’s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil.

Tampa mayoral candidate Ed Turanchik does.His campaign platform calls for stopping unlimited accumulations of vacation and sick days and taking a long look at the city's pay scales. He told the weekly publication Creative Loafing in the Dec. 10, 2010, issue that, ""No one in the private sector gets unlimited accruals of vacation and sick leave. That's gotta be changed.""We wanted to know, can Tampa's city workers collect unlimited vacation and sick time? And are such practices extinct at private companies?Tampa’s policyWe first turned to Tampa's personnel manual for guidance. Full-time workers get about 12 vacation days per year, plus extra days depending on how long the person has worked for the city. A 20-year employee earns seven extra days, for example. Workers also receive 12 days of sick leave, but don't get extra days based on seniority.Employees can save their vacation time and carry up to six weeks to the next year. Additional vacation time gets converted to sick days, which have more restrictions than vacation time. Workers can carry forward as much sick leave as they want.(Tampa has four contracts that cover union workers, police officers, firefighters and all other employees. Each contract is different, but the vacation and sick leave policies are largely consistent.)Asked on Jan. 25 about his description of Tampa's benefits package, Turanchik noted that retiring workers are paid for their unused vacation time (up to the six-week cap) and for half of their unused sick days. Even though vacation time is capped, he said, extra days are converted to sick leave and can eventually be cashed out at the lower rate.""It grows and grows and grows,"" he said.So Turanchik is mostly correct about Tampa's policy. Combining vacation and sick leave, an employee can accumulate unlimited paid time off. But vacation days are capped and additional time is counted as sick leave, which is harder to use and less lucrative upon retirement.Tampa is mostly in line with other large area cities, though it's the only major city with unlimited sick leave. Both St. Petersburg and Clearwater cap vacation and sick days. Retiring St. Petersburg city workers can cash out almost five months of unused time off, while their Clearwater counterparts get a little more than five months. (That figure was cut by about a third for newer Clearwater hires.)Tampa vs. the private sectorIt turns out that policies similar to Tampa's are somewhat common in the private sector, according to several studies of employee benefits packages.The New Jersey-based employment law think tank Alexander Hamilton Institute surveyed 1,193 companies about their benefits. Roughly three-fifths of the businesses have traditional vacation plans such as Tampa's. The rest give workers a lump sum of time off to use for vacation, sick days or personal time.The survey found a large group of traditional companies — about 36 percent — offer unlimited sick time. Another 28 percent let workers collect more than six weeks.Tampa's 30-day cap on vacation time also is common, though less so. About one-fifth of traditional employers set caps between 21 and 30 days. Roughly the same number allow workers to carry only five days to the next year. Almost 11 percent allow unlimited vacation accumulation.Another report has similar results. A 2009 survey by the Society for Human Resources Management found that 14 percent of traditional companies offer unlimited sick time. On average, companies allowed workers to roll over 20 vacation days to the next year, or 10 days less than the city of Tampa.We sent Turanchik copies of the studies and asked him if he had any evidence to support his statement that ""no one"" in private business gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. He said he made the claim based on his own experience as a labor lawyer and from talking with business owners.""I haven't talked to a single business in the Tampa Bay area that allows for unlimited accruals,"" he said.Turanchik also pointed to another finding from the Alexander Hamilton Institute: 87 percent of employers, a ""resounding majority,"" don't cash out unused sick time when a worker retires.""It's just not a package you see,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's a few companies that do it. But as a general proposition, it's just not an acceptable practice.""Our rulingTuranchik's description of Tampa's benefits package is largely correct. He's also right that it's rare for a private business to offer unlimited accumulation of sick leave with a large payout upon retirement. Unlimited vacation also is rare.But his original statement was ""no one"" in the private sector gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. Several studies say that's not true -- though very few of those companies will pay for unused sick time upon retirement as the city does. The essence of his point is correct, and we rate Turanchik's statement Half True.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021","http://www.edturanchikformayor.com/node/47,http://blogs.creativeloafing.com/dailyloaf/2010/12/10/ed-turanchik-delivers-position-paper-on-his-vision-of-tampa/,http://www.tampagov.net/dept_human_resources/files/Personnel_Manual.pdf,/personalities/viral-image/,/factchecks/2021/feb/10/viral-image/photo-shows-tampa-mayor-maskless-september-not-sup/",,"Public Service,Retirement,Florida,Ed Turanchik",,,,,

The bills are attracting much interest after the Jan. 8 shooting in Arizona that killed six and injured Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. One of the bills, Senate Bill 432 sponsored by state Sen. Greg Evers, R-Crestview, aims to prevent doctors from asking patients questions about their access to firearms and makes violations a felony punishable by up to a $5 million fine.Doctors argue against the proposed law. It also would prohibit physicians from refusing to see patients who won't answer questions about guns and bans the medical staff from writing down information about patients and their guns. This bill, then, is a battle between the gun lobby and the doctors' lobby, two powerful groups in Tallahassee.This Truth-O-Meter isn't going to weigh in on the argument about gun control. Our question: Are the fatality comparisons between medical mishaps and firearms correct?NRA's accident factsThe Miami Herald article said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer cited ""statistics showing that medical mishaps kill more people than guns,"" but did not cite the actual statistics. Hammer said she gave the Herald a one-page document called ""Firearms Accidents Facts"" compiled by the Unified Sportsmen of Florida in June 2010. The document compares accidental death by firearms to other types of accidents -- from choking to tricycles -- both nationally and in Florida. The Unified Sportsmen of Florida is the state's affiliate of the NRA.The fact-sheet includes comparisons to accidental deaths by ""medical misadventures"" -- both in raw numbers and in rates per capita -- but doesn't specify the year. Medical misadventures, the handout says, ""is a term used by some statisticians to cover 'accidents' by doctors and other medical personnel."" Note that this claim covers only gun accidents -- it doesn't include firearm deaths due to murder or suicide.According to the sheet:• Nationally, ""4 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.• In Florida, ""6 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.Hammer on Jan. 17 directed us to Mark Overstreet, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research coordinator. He told us that the figures -- compiled by the NRA for Hammer -- were from 2007. He pointed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) -- an interactive database that provides customized reports.The death data is compiled by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This information comes from death certificates filed in state vital-statistics offices and includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners, according to the CDC. All of the states comply with providing this data.Firearm accident dataOn the WISQARS website, we searched Fatal Injury Reports 1999-2007 for ""unintentional,"" ""firearms,"" ""2007"" and ""United States."" That produced a chart that showed 613 deaths in the U.S. for 2007.Then we queried the same data for Florida and found 16 deaths.CDC's adverse effects dataThe death data about medical care was far more complex. We'll walk you through the numbers and explain why it doesn't provide a complete picture. We'll also discuss the ""medical misadventures"" label.On WISQARS, we marked ""all intents"" and ""medical care, adverse effects"" for 2007 and saw 2,248 deaths nationwide. For Florida, the number was 108 deaths.We thought those figures sounded awfully low for deaths as a result of medical errors. A 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, ""To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,"" concluded that medical error deaths range from about 44,000 to 98,000 a year.Let's summarize what we found before we delve into why the government's data is so low on such deaths:Accidental deaths 2007         Nationwide     FloridaFirearms                                          613                16Medical care adverse effects        2,248               108What the stats meanWe interviewed Robert N. Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, to explain what the numbers mean.The deaths are coded by categories, and one category is indeed labeled ""misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care."" Some examples are an unintentional cut, a foreign object accidentally left in the body during surgery, and contaminated medical substances.Other categories included in ""adverse effects:""• Breakdown or malfunctioning of a medical device.• ""Surgical and other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure."" Anderson told us that refers to procedures such as a patient reacting badly to an organ transplant.• Complication of medical care, which was a significant factor even though the care (such as surgery) occurred more than one year prior to death. This is also often referred to as ""late effects,"" Anderson said.So overall, ""medical care, adverse effects"" includes both errors and complications.How many errors?We asked Anderson: Are the majority medical errors?""I’m not sure,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Only a very few in adverse effects category are explicitly medical misadventures."" He added, ""Just because a misadventure is not specified, doesn’t mean that it didn’t occur. My guess is that many ... (in some categories) are indeed medical errors, but have been characterized as complications.""Anderson also explained a key limitation of the data: It is only as accurate as the information provided on the death certificates by doctors. The WISQARS system tabulates types of deaths based on the ""underlying cause of death."" Suppose a man had heart disease and needed a heart procedure, a doctor punctured his artery during surgery and the patient bled to death. If the doctor reports the underlying cause of death as heart disease, then it won't be counted in the ""medical care, adverse effects"" category.The CDC offers another source of online data called the WONDER system, which tabulates if a cause of death was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, even if it wasn't listed as the ""underlying cause."" The most recent year we could look up for WONDER was 2006.The WONDER database showed 22,116 deaths from ""medical care, adverse effects"" nationwide in 2006 and about 1,319 for Florida. Anderson acknowledges that even that figure is low.The reason, according to Anderson: ""The physician who makes the error doesn't have any incentive to report it. Actually they have a disincentive to report it even though it's in the interests of medical care in general to have that information reported. ... We are at the mercy of the cause of death certifier and how thorough they are in their reporting of cause of death.""Anderson said he personally finds some studies more believable than others -- for example he disagrees with counting all hospital infections as errors. But he says he agrees with the Institute of Medicine study that put the figure between 44,000 and 98,000 -- and says even though that study is from 1999, he believes little has changed since then.Firearm data is  also uncertainAnderson also raised a concern with the firearm data, that self-inflicted gun deaths could be accidental or a suicide, and some could be mis-classified or labeled as ""intent undetermined.""It's worth repeating that the vast majority of firearm deaths are by suicide and murder -- only a small slice of firearm deaths are accidental. According to the WISQARS data, in 2007 there were 31,224 firearm deaths nationwide -- the largest category was suicide followed by murder. That total number of firearm deaths is many multiples higher than the CDC's count for ""medical care, adverse effects"" deaths.We asked Hammer, why make the comparison solely on accidents?""When doctors claim that they have a right to question children and the parents of children because they want to prevent deaths by accidents with firearms, the facts speak for themselves,"" Hammer said. ""There are a number of areas dealing with medical care over which they have some control that (doctors) should focus attention on.""And Overstreet, the NRA researcher, defends the use of WISQARS data, even knowing its limitations.""We are not looking to jack the numbers up,"" he said. ""We are saying this is what the federal government is reporting.""Anderson doesn't disagree.""With the data issues surrounding medical errors, it's a fairly difficult comparison,"" he said. However, ""I don't think they are off base. I don't think they are doing something making an invalid comparison. ... What they are basically doing is looking at the government's underlying cause data. They are not even saying it's a gross underestimate. They are being very conservative here.""Our rulingFeatured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021So, is the NRA right to state that, nationwide, people are four times more likely to die from medical misadventures than firearm accidents and that figure drops to six times more likely for Florida?The government's 2007 data shows 613 accidental firearm deaths nationwide compared to 2,248 deaths from medical care adverse effect. That's close to four times, as the NRA handout says. In Florida, there were 16 accidental firearm deaths compared to 108 medical care adverse effect. That's almost seven times, even worse than the six times cited by the NRA.We have two concerns: The WISQARS data comes with a lot of caveats when examining medical errors, and even the gun data may not be perfect. And the NRA's fact-sheet ignores gun deaths from murders and suicides, which take a significantly higher toll than accidents and can't be ignored in the gun debate.For the point the NRA is making -- accidents only, guns v. medical misadventures -- the numbers back up their claims but need clarification and context. We rate this claim Mostly True.","http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/16/2018335_p2/floridas-solution-to-violence.html#,http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s0432__.DOCX&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=0432&Session=2011,https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=1TAWitxXrFuYB23MSzwvrJSVoKTxDIxsAqQOvijQu8Rhzoayl94Vu5QbC5X_v&hl=en,http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html,http://webappa.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe,http://webappa.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe,http://webappa.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe,http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx,http://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10.html,/personalities/viral-image/,/factchecks/2021/feb/10/viral-image/photo-shows-tampa-mayor-maskless-september-not-sup/",,"Health Care,Florida,Guns,National Rifle Association",,,,,

We saw it when one of our readers passed it along.""Dear Newsmax Reader"" the e-mail read. ""The average American works three months a year, WITHOUT PAY, for the federal government. If you are in a higher tax bracket, you could be spending up to half your life working for Uncle Sam. And how is your money being spent?""The example that most piqued our interest was this one: ""The refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers $146 million annually.""We decided to check to see if the claim was correct.An Internet search first directed us to a column by Brian Riedl, a fiscal policy specialist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The column was posted on the website of the Orange County Register on Nov. 25, 2009. Further research revealed that the data came from a September 2007 study by the Government Accountability Office, the non-partisan investigative arm of Congress.The GAO concluded that at least $146 million was spent on ""improper first- and business-class travel government-wide"" between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006. It arrived at this number by obtaining billing information from government travel charge-card databases operated by Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and U.S. Bank. The audit focused on executive branch agencies and wholly owned government corporations and excluded travel by the judicial and legislative branches.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021The rules defining justified premium air travel are complicated, but generally speaking, agencies can provide business class travel in circumstances such as when an individual has a physical disability that is certified by a medical professional or when a flight is to or from a destination outside the continental United States, exceeds 14 hours and is taken without a rest stop en route or at destination.GAO researchers selected what they described as a statistically valid sample of 96 premium-class flight purchases with a price tag of $391,000. These purchases received close scrutiny.""For each sample transaction, we requested that the entities provide the travel authorization, travel voucher, travel itinerary, and other related supporting documentations demonstrating justification for premium travel arrangements,"" the report said. ""Based on the information provided, we assessed whether premium class travel was properly authorized and whether the premium class travel was justified in accordance with (federal) or other applicable travel regulations. If, after repeated requests, the entities did not provide us with the supporting documentation, we concluded that the premium class travel was improper.""All told, about two-thirds of the trips were either ""not properly authorized, not properly justified, or both,"" the GAO found. This percentage was then projected onto the universe of federal premium travel billings, which was $230 million over the time period studied. Adjusting slightly downward as a hedge against statistical error, GAO concluded that $146 million of the $230 million spent on premium flights was unjustified.The GAO noted that the differences between first class, business class and coach tickets can be wide. Citing data from the General Services Administration, a federal agency, the GAO noted that government fare for business-class travel ""is typically more than 5 times the price of coach class travel for comparable routes, with some tickets costing more than 10 times as much. First-class travel can be even more costly. For example, we found that a round-trip first-class ticket from Washington, D.C., to London cost over $12,000 compared to a business class ticket that would have cost about $6,000, or a coach class ticket that would have cost less than $800.""If you trust GAO's sampling and overall methodology -- and we have no reason to doubt it -- then Newsmax's presentation of the data seems pretty accurate. We only had two quibbles:• The GAO's methodology doesn't delve into the question of the employee's motives when seeking a premium-class flight, so we think '""refusal"" is too strong a word for Newsmax to use when describring how the federal employees reacted to the idea of flying coach.• GAO noted that the $230 million spent on premium-class flights accounted for less than 1 percent of the cost of all federal government flights during the period. So the overcharges themselves amounted to less than 1 percent of the total spent on federal airline travel.When we asked Riedl about this, he said that ""the point is that taxpayers paid for $146 million in largely unnecessary spending. Whether that accounts for 1 percent, 10 percent, or 50 percent of the total federal travel budget is irrelevant to that point.""We do think that knowing the full context might give readers a different impression, and we believe the word ""refusal"" oversteps. But in general, the $146 million number was determined by what appears to be a credible methodology, and by a group -- the GAO -- without a partisan axe to grind. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.","http://articles.ocregister.com/2009-11-25/opinion/24659852_1_government-waste-brian-riedl-spending/2,http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d071268.pdf,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Transparency,Newsmax",,,,,

He wrote an end-of-the year column for Politico, a Washington news organization, saying Obama’s ""list of achievements already dwarfs that of many presidents.""Kaine, a former Virginia governor, encountered skepticism during a TV interview last Sunday. Ed Henry, CNN’s senior White House corespondent, noted Obama’s approval rating from voters dropped 6 percentage points in 2010.""You made your case but it seems like the American people aren’t buying it, sir,"" Henry said.Kaine replied, ""Relatively, if you look at the president’s mid-term numbers compared to other presidents in their mid-term, he’s fine.""We decided to take a closer look. Kaine was responding to a Gallup poll conducted in the final week of December that showed 47 percent of adult Americans approved of Obama’s job performance, 45 percent disapproved and 8 percent were undecided.First, we asked for clarification of what Kaine meant when he said Obama is ""fine.""Alec Gerlach, a DNC press secretary, said Kaine meant Obama’s mid-term poll numbers ""are in the neighborhood of other presidents who got re-elected, including Reagan and Clinton."" So for this fact-check we will focus on whether Obama's ratings are indeed similar to presidents who got re-elected.Then we researched polls by Gallup because it has the longest record of tracking presidential popularity, dating to 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt was beginning his second term. We compared Obama’s numbers to the approval ratings other presidents received at the start of the year after mid-term congressional elections.To keep the comparison consistent, we turned to the first Gallup poll on Obama completely conducted in 2011. A survey from Jan. 2 to Jan. 4 found the president had 49 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval and 6 percent were undecided on his job perfromance.The average mid-term mark for presidents -- from Roosevelt in 1939 through Obama in 2011 -- is 53.5 percent approval, 36 percent disapproval and 10.5 percent undecided. Obama seems to be in the neighborhood, but not on the best street.Let’s look at the presidents who got reelected in that time span. Their average mid-term approval was 57 percent and disapproval was 35 percent. Obama is not in that school district. But neither were Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton midway through their first terms. Then they moved up quickly.Reagan was the least popular mid-term president. At the start of 1983, with the nation emerging from recession, he had 37 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. Less than two years later, Reagan carried all but one state in a landslide reelection.Bill Clinton’s numbers at the start of 1995 were similar to Obama’s today. Clinton had 47 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval. In 1996, he was easily reelected.In contrast, George H.W. Bush had a robust 59 percent approval rating in early 1991 only to lose reelection the next year.All told, we were able to find the last 19 mid-term presidential polls by Gallup. Obama’s approval rating is the 11th highest. Of the eight presidents below him, four times their party retained the White House in the next election, and four times it didn’t.Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says mid-term polls are a horrible gauge of coming elections because a president’s popularity can soar or plummet with events.""They don’t say a thing,"" he said. ""The numbers that matter are the votes of people and, considering the beating Democrats took on Nov. 7, the president is by no means OK, assured of a successful term or a second one.""Let’s review.Kaine, with his spokesman’s elaboration, said Obama’s mid-term polling popularity is ""fine"" compared to other presidents who went on to re-election.Kaine is correct in saying that Obama’s numbers compare favorably to Reagan and Clinton. But the president’s mid-term approval rating -- gauged by the first poll completely conducted in the new mid-term year -- is 8 percentage points below the average of re-elected presidents since 1939. His disapproval rating is 10 percentage points above the average.We know those numbers can change in an instant. But when a politician is down by 8 or 10 percentage points, we say he’s behind but within striking distance.We rate Kaine’s statement Half True. Featured Fact-checkElaine Luriastated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.On accepting corporate PAC donationsBy Warren Fiske • February 5, 2021","http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46920.html,http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/02/dnc-chair-obama-unlikely-to-face-democratic-challenger/,http://www.gallup.com/poll/113980/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Job-Approval.aspx,http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating.cfm,/personalities/elaine-luria/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/elaine-luria/elaine-luria-reverses-pledge-refuse-corporate-pac-/",,"Polls and Public Opinion,Virginia,Tim Kaine",,,,,

December figures are not yet available.And, indeed, unemployment increased in 21 states in November compared to October, according to the labor statistics seasonally adjusted figures, further highlighting Ohio’s gains.In fact, Ohio’s unemployment rate in November was 9.8 percent, drawing even with instead of hovering above the national average for the first time since December 2002, according Ohio Department of Job & Family Services Director Douglas Lumpkin. The national average increased in November from 9.6 to 9.8 percent.Five other states also have either shown a decline or stagnation since April from month to month but no increases in its unemployment rate: Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.But only Ohio and Illinois have produced consistent drops.

Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, called an immigration bill that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship ""a nightmare for the American people.""Among other arguments against the bill, Smith says in his piece published in The Hill Nov. 30 that ""once the DREAM Act's amnesty recipients become citizens and turn 21, they can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization.""The U.S. House subsequently voted 216-198 in favor of the the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act. But the measure didn't make it through the Senate, where proponents fell five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and usher the legislation to the floor.We're not getting into whether providing a path for undocumented minors to become citizens is the same thing as amnesty. Yet we waded into the family issue earlier this month when we rated Barely True a statement by Smith's Texas colleague, Rep. Ted-Poe, R-Humble, who said that ""after you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States.""Poe skipped several stipulations that an undocumented citizen must satisfy before becoming a citizen, and he went too far when he said undocumented-residents-turned-citizens can sponsor their extended family to come here. According to the U.S. State Department, citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to come legally to the United States.Smith's statement reflects accurately on provisions in federal law permitting a citizen to sponsor immediate family members — a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 — to enter the country with an ""immediate relative immigrant visa."" Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residence as well, according to the State Department.Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021We identified a wrinkle, though, not acknowledged in Smith's statement.Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, which is generally pro-immigration, said in an e-mail: ""It is incredibly unlikely that DREAM Act beneficiaries would have citizenship by the age of 21. Even if someone completed every requirement (including higher education) on the date of enactment of the legislation, they would still need to spend 10 years in non-immigrant status and then another three years as a legal permanent resident before they would be eligible for citizenship. With high school graduation at 18, you could assume that many people would be 31 before they would gain citizenship under DREAM.""There have been various versions of the DREAM Act, but according to recent legislation, an undocumented resident must be younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law to become eligible for the act's benefits.Such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a ""conditional non-immigrant,"" during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military and be of ""good moral character,"" among other requirements, before qualifying for a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. After three more years, he or she is eligible to become a naturalized citizen.So, while Smith is correct that a U.S. citizen must be 21 to sponsor his or her parents for legal residence, it's unlikely that anyone who becomes a U.S. citizen under the DREAM Act would be younger than 21.We rate Smith's statement as Mostly True.","https://politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/dec/08/ted-poe/ted-poe-says-under-dream-act-after-undocumented-re/,/personalities/tom-cotton/,/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/",,"Immigration,Texas,Lamar Smith",,,,,

He said it was attended by about a dozen people, including political action committee representatives. Slepian called it ""disingenuous"" for the DCCC to attack Renacci for holding a fundraiser with PACs in light of the fact that the DCCC-backed incumbent that Renacci beat, Rep. John Boccieri, got most of his election money from PACs. During his term in Congress, Boccieri held numerous PAC fundraisers in Washington, according to a Sunlight Foundation database of fundraising invitations.""We are just raising some money the way every other elected official is trying to do,"" Slepian said. ""There wasn’t an ‘open for business’ sign anywhere.""Is Renacci being hypocritical for raising PAC money after his election?During his campaign for Congress, Renacci often criticized his Democratic rival for relying on political action committee money. It’s a standard charge that challengers throw at incumbents. An Oct. 15 news release from Renacci said that ""John Boccieri has consistently relied on Washington special interests and union bosses to finance his campaign — with a majority of his contributions coming from political action committees.""A review of Boccieri’s latest Federal Election Commission report shows the incumbent got about $1,047,000 from political action committees and $983,000 from individuals, which means he got roughly 52 percent of his money from PACs. A Center for Responsive Politics analysis of Boccieri’s PAC donations shows about a third of them came from organized labor, a third came from businesses and a third from ""ideological or single issue"" groups.But even as Renacci complained about Boccieri’s political action committee money, he took it himself. Federal Election Committee records show that Renacci’s campaign got about $317,000 from political action committees and $1.1 million in donations from individuals. Renacci, an independently wealthy businessman, also loaned about $750,000 of his own money to the campaign. That’s the debt he’s now trying to pay off. About 15 percent of Renacci’s money came from PACs, about half was from individual donors, and about a third came from his own pocket.Renacci accepted money from political action committees long before he won his election. Those that gave him $10,000 before November include committees representing Timken Co., Murray Energy and the American Health Care Association. The bulk of his PAC money came from committees operated by GOP politicians and from businesses, according to a Center for Responsive Politics breakdown of Renacci’s donations.During the campaign, Renacci was up front about his political action committee backing, putting out news releases when well known conservative PACS like the Family Research Council Action PAC, the Ohio Right to Life PAC, the House Conservatives Fund, and The Citizens United Political Victory Fund, announced they’d back him.Dictionaries define a hypocrite as someone whose actions contradict their stated beliefs. While Renacci publicly denounced Boccieri for accepting a large proportion of PAC money, he accepted PAC money himself all along, and continues to do so. He also publicly touted some of the ideological group PACs that backed his campaign.So while there is an element of hypocrisy given Renacci’s past criticism, the DCCC’s indignation needs to be put in context, especially since its candidate received a majority of his contributions from PACs.If Renacci’s PAC fundraising begins to outstrip his individual fundraising, he could end up deeper in hypocrisy territory. Meantime, we say the DCCC’s charge is Half True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook postSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett “donated $58 million” to his campaign.By Tom Kertscher • January 29, 2021","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/05/AR2010120504336.html,http://politicalpartytime.org/,http://www.renacciforcongress.com/blog/Renacci_Campaign_Hauls_580000_3rd_Quarter,http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00435065/522110/,https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/pacs.php?cycle=2010&cid=N00029161&sector=P&seclong=Labor&newMem=N,http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00466359/521122/,https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/pacs.php?cycle=2010&cid=N00031127&newMem=Y&type=I,http://www.renacciforcongress.com/blog/Family_Research_Council_Action_PAC_Endorses_Jim_Renacci_for_Congress,http://www.renacciforcongress.com/blog/Ohio_Right_Life_Endorses_Jim_Renacci_for_Congress,http://www.renacciforcongress.com/blog/House_Conservatives_Fund_Endorses_Renacci_for_Congress,http://www.renacciforcongress.com/blog/Citizens_United_Endorses_Jim_Renacci_for_Congress,/personalities/facebook-posts/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/facebook-posts/post-about-keystone-pipeline-falsely-claims-buffet/",,"Ohio,Campaign Finance,Elections,Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee",,,,,

You get help when you’re not.""",,politifact,,"If you lose your job and it’s not your fault -- you didn’t steal, sell trade secrets or tell rude  customers what they could do with that hideous tie they want to return the hellish day after Christmas -- you can usually get unemployment benefits. Here’s how it works: The state of Ohio will help you out for 26 weeks. Then a federal program kicks in to cover 20 more weeks during times of high unemployment.But in the recessionary doldrums of the last two years, Congress has given even more help -- up to 53 weeks more. That makes all these jobless benefits add up to 99 weeks.The latest congressional extension, though, expired on Nov. 30, and Congress hasn’t decided whether to grant another one.The money would have to come from the federal Treasury, which already borrows money to keep the government operating, and that’s the biggest hangup. Some lawmakers say they don’t want to keep adding to the deficit, so they’re insisting on offsets from other domestic programs.Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is not in that camp, however. He says that people who get unemployment compensation tend to spend it right away on groceries or rent, so it has a stimulative effect. Many, but not all, economists agree. Regardless, Brown says that Congress needs to show some compassion, because so many Americans are struggling to find work.""Understand, this is unemployment insurance,"" Brown told MSNBC anchor Contessa Brewer on Nov. 30. ""It’s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you’re working. You get help when you’re not.""Brown raises several points that we thought were worth checking. The key point: Do workers pay into the unemployment system and then draw benefits from it if they lose their jobs?The unemployment system is a bit more complex than that. Workers don’t pay into the system. But their employers do, up to a point.In Ohio, private employers pay anywhere from 0.5 percent to 9.4 percent of the first $9,000 of workers’ wages into the state uninsurance fund, according to the state’s Department of Job and Family Services. A company’s payroll size, its total contributions and its claims experience account for the variation. Generally, companies that lay off a lot of people have higher unemployment taxes.There also is a federal unemployment compensation fee, but it comes to only 0.8 percent.Back to Brown’s claim: ""You pay into it when you’re working."" As just mentioned, it’s actually the employer who pays into it.Brown and his communications director said he is fully aware of this, but that employers regard their premiums as part of the cost of compensation, so in a figurative manner he was saying the same thing. Brown made that point again Dec. 1 in a conference call with reporters to discuss an unrelated matter and we asked him about paying for  unemployment compensation.We checked with economists at the socially liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Regardless both agreed Brown is essentially right.""That’s a cost of hiring workers, and that’s a reduction in the amount of money that they’re willing to pay in wages,"" said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at Heritage, said that economists believe 85 percent of the cost of these taxes on employers would otherwise fall back to the employees.OK, so the employee pays the taxes indirectly. But that only covers the state portion of jobless benefits, or 26 weeks. Everything after that is coming from the federal government. ""It’s mostly deficit financing at this point,"" said Sherk.Money from that first 20-week extension would ordinarily be split between the state and federal governments, but the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- better known as the stimulus act -- picked up the state’s portion.One more component of Brown’s claim: that ""a lot of my Republican colleagues"" like to suggest that unemployment insurance is like welfare. This was an important part of the claim because it explains why he felt the need to clarify how the system is funded -- not by freeloaders but by workers who pay into the system. So we asked Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, to back up this part of the claim, too.She sent us news stories and links to transcripts, newscasts and news releases in which lawmakers or candidates said that unemployment payments can encourage people to stay jobless (Senate candidate Sharon Angle, Sen.-elect Ron Johnson, Sen. Richard Burr and others); are a disincentive to seeking work (Sen. John Kyl), or, stated another way, pose the risk of creating hobos (Rep. Dean Heller of Nevada). Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah proposed that people receiving federal benefits, including jobless benefits, be tested for drugs.Far be it from us to analyze the behavior of all people who are out of work or say whether they’d rather collect benefits -- which average about $300 a week -- than get a job. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve Bank estimates that the receipt of unemployment benefits explains only 0.4 to 1.7 percentage points of the unemployment rate, which nationally is 9.8 percent. In other words, most people would rather work.So let’s break down Brown’s claim and our fact-finding.Featured Fact-checkKevin McCarthystated on February 9, 2021 in a press releaseRaising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour “would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.”By Chris Nichols • February 11, 2021""A lot of my Republican colleagues"" like to suggest that jobless benefits are like welfare. What he meant was clear enough -- that they equate jobless benefits to the public dole. We can’t quantify ""a lot."" But Brown’s staff provided numerous examples that show there are Republicans saying they worry that jobless benefits encourage people to stay out of work. This isn’t to suggest it is a majority view. But Brown did not say ""most."" He said ""a lot."" This part of the claim, then, warrants at least a Half True.""You pay into it when you’re working."" Economists from the right and left agreed that this is essentially correct, with some elaboration required. So it is Mostly True.""You get help when you’re not."" This is True.This entire discussion needs a caveat. MSNBC put Brown on the air because of the ongoing debate over extending federal jobless benefits. The reason for debate is the fact that the federal government has to pick up the tab and it will have to borrow more to do so, at least in the short term. To put matters clearly: You pay into the unemployment compensation through your employer, and that pool of money pays for your state benefits -- but not your federal benefits -- if you lose your job.We could use the averages from the three pieces to Brown’s claim -- Half True (but unmeasurable), Mostly True and True -- and arrive at a rating of Mostly True. Or we could turn to the principles of the Truth-o-Meter. According to those principles, a statement is Mostly True if it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.Either way you slice it, we arrive at the same place: Mostly True.","http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/07/two_more_republicans_say_unemp.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804927.html?hpid=topnews,http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/23/heller-government-creating-hobos/,https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895004575395491314812452.html,/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/,/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/",,"Ohio,Deficit,Economy,Federal Budget,Jobs,Sherrod Brown",,,,,

They wanted to know if it is true that the bill would regulate backyard gardening.They sent us several claims promoted by various bloggers. Here's how a website called NaturalNews put it""Senate Bill 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act, has been called 'the most dangerous bill in the history of the United States of America.' It would grant the U.S. government new authority over the public's right to grow, trade and transport any foods. This would give Big Brother the power to regulate the tomato plants in your backyard. ... This tyrannical law puts all food production (yes, even food produced in your own garden) under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Yep -- the very same people running the TSA and its naked body scanner / passenger groping programs.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021This kind of statement takes a real concern about the bill -- that it might impose excessive regulation on small farmers -- and blows it up into a fabrication.First, a bit about the legislation: Congress decided to act after several notable cases of people being sickened by contaminated foods, such as eggs that were subject to a major recall earlier this year. One out of four Americans are sickened by tainted food each year and 5,000 die, according to the National Center for Infectious Diseases. The bill gives the Food and Drug Administration -- not the Department of Homeland Security -- expanded powers to inspect facilities and trace food-borne illness. (The Department of Homeland Security is mentioned in the bill in respect to regulating food imported from overseas and in preventing intentional poisoning of the food supply.) It also allows the FDA to impose mandatory recalls after illness outbreaks, instead of asking companies to comply voluntarily.Consumer advocates said the bill was a common-sense step forward. Others expressed concern that the law was too broad: it asks the Secretary for Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, to develop specific regulations about how the increased inspections would work.Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute reviewed a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives last year, and said he was concerned that the language in the House bill was overly broad. ""The question of how much or little is encompassed by this language seems open to differing interpretations and would be the subject of much jockeying when the actual regulations implementing the law were written,"" he said.The Senate took up the issue more recently, and, to allay concerns about small growers, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., offered an amendment exempting most local food providers and small farmers from new federal regulations as long as the growers complied with local rules and their produce was not connected to active outbreaks of illness.The Senate accepted the amendment and approved the overall bill 73 to 25 on Tuesday. The House must now approve it, either outright or through conference committee, and the President must sign it before it becomes law.So will Big Brother be trailing around behind you in his Wellingtons next spring as you set out your seedlings?We reviewed the Senate version of the bill carefully and read ongoing news coverage of the food safety law. Nowhere could we find mention of backyard gardens being included. In fact, the Senate version, even prior to Tester's amendment, said regulations must be developed that prioritize food facilities that pose the highest risk to public safety. That would imply that not all facilities would receive the same level of scrutiny.Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill makes no mention of widespread inspections in its cost estimates. ""Based on the inspection schedule specified, CBO estimates that this bill would require about 50,000 domestic and foreign food facilities to be inspected in 2015,"" said a CBO report. Meanwhile, the National Gardening Association estimates that 36 million households participated in food gardening in 2008.Finally, we checked in with a few groups that followed the legislation's development closely. We interviewed Scott Openshaw, director of communications for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents major food companies and tracked the legislation closely. He said the pending legislation will not apply to home gardeners.""Backyard gardens will NOT be affected in any, way, shape or form by the food safety bill. Zero, zilch, zip, nada,"" Openshaw told us via e-mail.Another person who followed the bill closely was David Plunkett, a senior staff attorney for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest; he too said that backyard gardens were not part of the bill. Plunkett pointed us to a line in Section 105 the Senate bill that said the rules ""shall not apply to produce that is produced by an individual for personal consumption.""In rating this statement, we see no evidence to support the claim that backyard gardens would be regulated under the food safety bill. There might be legitimate concerns about small growers, but even those have been addressed in the Senate version of the bill. At any rate, concerns about small growers are quite different then the claim that backyard gardens will be regulated. We find no evidence to support the claim and rate it Pants on Fire.","http://www.naturalnews.com/019395.html,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"Agriculture,National,Food Safety,Regulation,Bloggers",,,,,

Tom Petri, a Republican from Fond du Lac, has kept a pretty low profile on controversial issues.So it was a bit of a surprise to see his name on the bottom of a Nov. 17, 2010 statement that called the Madison-Milwaukee high speed rail link a ""boondoggle"" and declared:""This high speed rail project is a bad investment for taxpayers and our state simply cannot afford it.""  Especially since Petri’s name was on an earlier letter, dated Aug. 10, 2009, about the high-speed rail effort, which said in part:""This investment will strengthen the surrounding Midwest economies through new rail and construction jobs, while also increasing development and connectivity from rural to urban areas.""What happened in those intervening 15 months?Well, after Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle spent years working with other Midwestern states on plans for high-speed rail, the Milwaukee-Madison link was one of 13 projects selected to receive federal funding -- $810 million -- in January 2010.Then Republican Scott Walker made stopping the train a central part of this gubernatorial campaign, as did Republican candidates in Ohio and Florida. Now, Walker says Congress should allow the state to use the $810 million on roads -- though many, including Petri, say that’s unlikely. Other states -- New York, North Carolina, California and, of course, Illinois -- are clamoring for the money Wisconsin is about to take a pass on.And, the state’s Republican members of Congress are, well, circling the wagons around Walker.Thus, the November statement from Petri and U.S. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner of Menomonee Falls and Paul Ryan of Janesville. It read:""We support Governor-elect Walker's effort to put the brakes on the High Speed Rail budget boondoggle, which is why we introduced legislation, today, that would give states the ability to return federal funds obligated to high-speed rail projects, and instead use this money to reduce our nation’s $1.6 trillion deficit and $13.8 trillion debt.""So, it’s time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter.Remember, we’re not passing judgment on whether the shift was good policy or even good politics. The Flip-O-Meter measures only how much an elected official’s position has changed.Petri’s position was pretty clear in that first letter, in which he joined with U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-Minn.) and announced the creation of a congressional caucus to support high speed rail, including the network that would include the Milwaukee-Madison link.That was the letter about a strengthened economy and all that rural-urban connectivity.In many ways, the letter was in line with the views of Thompson, who was a strong backer of the high-speed network as governor and chairman of the Amtrak board. In September, Thompson did his own shift and said the state instead should ask that the money go to highways.""I was supportive of high speed trains because I believe high-speed trains has a place,"" Thompson said at the time. ""But at this day and time and the circumstances we have right now, we can't afford it.""Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, said he was merely heeding the wishes of state leaders, first Thompson and then Doyle.""My position was to make the strongest case I could for Wisconsin to have high speed rail,"" Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""That was successful.""So, what happened since?Petri said Walker’s election indicates that sentiment has turned away from the train. And if the train is stopped here, he wants the money to go to reduce the federal deficit -- not another state’s rail project.But how do you square a statement about the project's benefits with one declaring it a ""boondoggle""?Asked about the stark difference in the two letters bearing his boss’ signature, spokesman Niel Wright said Petri didn’t write the recent letter -- it came from Sensenbrenner’s office.""Sensenbrenner is hotter on this and more determined on this than Mr. Petri,"" Wright said.Indeed, in his interview with us, Petri sounded remarkably open to the need for a rail connection from Madison to Milwaukee and Chicago.""It probably should be considered at some point,"" especially as Madison continues to grow, he said.Petri also noted that the train was a ""pet project"" of President Barack Obama -- and that it was highly unlikely that the president would sign legislation directing the money for road work or deficit reduction. He said Wisconsin’s money could well wind up going to another state.""If that’s the choice,"" Petri said, ""I’d say just go ahead with it.""If so, the Flip-O-Meter will be back for the backflip.For now, we’ll say Petri has gone from a full-blown advocate for the high speed rail project to signing onto a statement that condemned the project.

Gov. Casey Cagle",,politifact,,"There was a time when the future looked very bright for Republican Casey Cagle, Georgia's lieutenant governor. He was young and riding the rising tide of a Republican takeover of what had once been a state dominated by Democrats.The governor's office seemed well within his reach. All he had to do was put a couple of terms as the state Senate's leader behind him, line up the campaign donors and then start measuring the curtains in the chief executive's suite.But these days, the doe-eyed Cagle looks more like a deer in the headlights, thanks to a rebellious group of his fellow Republican senators who have staged a lightning-quick palace coup, striking hard and fast at the man who was to have been their leader.The Nov. 2 election returns had barely been counted when the Republican caucus met in Macon in a closed-door session at Mercer University. With a voice vote, Republicans removed Cagle’s power to appoint Senate committee chairmen, which is the key to real influence in the upper chamber. They also stripped Cagle of the ability to decide the makeup of Senate committees. The lieutenant governor will be allowed to direct legislation to particular committees, but he can do that only under the supervision of the Senate membership.Cagle does still preside over the Senate, and he has the bully pulpit of the upper chamber at his disposal. And he can -- apparently -- still appoint senators to important conference committees to iron out House-Senate differences in legislation. However, that power also could come under attack when senators meet next month in Athens in a pre-session gathering.One newspaper columnist noted after the Nov. 5 Macon meeting that Cagle had been relegated to little more than a hall monitor.GOP leaders, however, painted a different picture.""This is simply a new power-sharing agreement that we’ve come to,"" Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, told reporters. That sentiment was echoed by other GOP leaders.PolitiFact Georgia wondered who's correct. Does Cagle retain important Senate powers? Or has he been reduced to figurehead?First, a little background about all the intraparty back-stabbing.During the last legislative session, Cagle inserted his Senate allies into the middle of a Republican brawl over Gov. Sonny Perdue's proposal to levy a tax on hospitals and other health facilities. Cagle backed the idea, but some key committee chairmen in the Senate vigorously opposed it. They claimed Cagle never consulted them before pledging their support. Cagle retaliated, stripping the chairmanships of Sens. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, and Preston Smith, R-Rome, two of four Republicans who voted against Perdue's proposal. Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, of Sharpsburg, resigned his position as party whip.That set the stage for a very uncivil war if Cagle won re-election. Which he did, easily, against Democrat Carol Porter. Ironically, Cagle campaigned against Porter by warning Georgia voters that Senate Republicans would immediately strip her of her Senate powers if she won.Emory University political scientist Merle Black said Cagle now finds himself in the same situation faced by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who was stripped of his power by the new GOP majority in 2003.""They've turned him into a nominal lieutenant governor -- lieutenant governor in name only,"" Black said. ""I think they've really limited his career opportunities.""Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said the GOP Senate leaders have essentially ""marginalized"" the lieutenant governor.""There is no doubt his power has been diminished by this,"" Swint said. ""He's not powerless, but his power has certainly been diminished.""Cagle spokesman Ben Fry had this to say about all the shenanigans: ""While some may be playing political games, the lieutenant governor remains committed to delivering results, which is exactly what the voters just overwhelmingly elected him to do. He is not going to let procedural hurdles get in the way of his passion for creating jobs and making the difficult decisions necessary to balance the budget and move our state forward.""But the facts are clear. Power in the Senate has shifted, and shifted dramatically.The real clout in the Senate now will be wielded by an eight-member committee. That body is composed of President Pro Tem Tommie Williams, five GOP caucus officers and two Senate appointees by Cagle. Cagle was expressly prohibited from membership on the committee.This is ""power sharing"" all right. In the aftermath of the Macon coup, the GOP Senate leadership now has all the power. And it doesn't plan to share it with Cagle.We find the GOP claim about power sharing with the lieutenant governor not only not accurate. It's ridiculous.

""A permanent extension of all those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020,"" the report said.The CBO projects the 2020 deficit -- based on an assumption that the tax cuts will not be extended -- at $685 billion.Republican congressional leaders want to make the tax cuts permanent. ""This is from a Republican Party that’s been griping about deficits,"" Kaine said on CNN.But by bringing up deficits, Kaine also sawed at the branch President Obama and many other Democrats have perched on during the tax debate. They’ve wanted to eliminate that tax cuts for the ""wealthy,"" defined as families with annual incomes exceeding $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Democrats have supported extending the reductions to families and individuals beneath those thresholds.Here’s the rub: Eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy and keeping them for everyone else doesn’t save big money. The Democratic tax plan would leave a projected deficit in 2020 that would be ""roughly three-quarters to four-fifths"" as high as that caused by the GOP plan to eliminate all the levies, according to the same CBO report cited by Kaine.Kaine didn’t mention this on CNN.""What he said is factually correct,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. ""What he didn’t say is that the Democratic plan to extend taxes for 98 percent of the population shoots almost as big a hole in the budget as the Republican plan.""We agree that the buyer must beware when browsing political statements.

Who knew Oregon took its ballot duty that seriously? But then, we became suspicious. Isn’t 25 percent of the population here under 18? How could it be then that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008? So, onward to the fact checking.First the numbers. There were more than 3.7 million people in Oregon as of July 2007. Obviously, the DPO didn’t mean to claim that babies cast ballots, so let’s whittle the number down to just eligible voters -- 2.8 million is what the secretary of state’s office estimated.Precisely 1,845,251 people cast ballots in the fall 2008 election. Multiply 2.8 million by 85 percent (0.85) and you get nearly 2.4 million people -- which is way more than the 1.8 million who actually voted.So what gives?Well, it turns out that 85 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. Not everyone who is eligible to vote actually registered to vote. In fact, according to the Secretary of State’s website, only 77 percent of eligible adults registered and of that figure, 85 percent cast ballots. Which brings the overall figure to 66 percent. That’s pretty good -- but not 85 percent good.To be fair, Oregon has long used this calculation to measure electoral participation of registered voters, which Oregon elections officials refer to as ""turnout,"" but no one with a straight face extrapolates that to say that means ""85 percent of Oregonians voted.""Also, not everyone measures turnout the same way. The United States Elections Project, for example, run by an associate professor atGeorge Mason University, uses as its base eligible voters to measure turnout, not registered voters.According to the elections project, 68.1 percent of eligible Oregonians voted in 2008. That’s on the high end, and it’s higher than the 62.2 percent cited nationally. Minnesota, apparently, can claim the title of most vote-happy state, with turnout at 78 percent two years ago; on the other hand, Hawaii, at 50.8 percent, just wasn’t into it.Oregon did have a fairly high voter participation rate in 2008. If the flier had said that Oregon’s turnout in 2008 was 85 percent, or that 85 percent of voters cast a ballot that year, we wouldn’t have a problem with the claim.But to say that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is just plain inaccurate.We rate the claim False.Featured Fact-checkConcerned Taxpayers of Americastated on October 25, 2010 in a television adSays Peter DeFazio votes with Nancy Pelosi 86 percent of the time.By Janie Har • October 26, 2010Comment on this item.","http://elections.gmu.edu/Templates/www.gmu.edu,http://elections.gmu.edu/Templates/www.gmu.edu,/personalities/concerned-taxpayers-america/,/factchecks/2010/oct/26/concerned-taxpayers-america/concerned-taxpayers-claim-peter-defazio-votes-nanc/,http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/politifact_oregon_run_that_num.html",,"Oregon,Voting Record,Democratic Party of Oregon",,,,,

It labels abortion ""infanticide,"" which is a crime. And the Christian Coalition of Florida states, ""Although legal in the United States, we believe abortion is no less than murder of an innocent human life."" Using this logic, abortion equals murder and murder is a crime. Therefore, those who have abortions would be criminals.The Christian Family Coalition, based in Miami, says it ""works to introduce pro-family legislation at the state and local levels of government. It informs and educates citizens on where candidates stand on the issues that affect the traditional family unit.""

They post opinions on everything from parental notice to making the violent death of any fetus -- viable or otherwise -- cause for a first-degree murder charge.But none appear to flat-out say they would support abortion regardless of whether a woman was raped, abused by a family member or faced with death. They skirt the issue. For example, Florida Right to Life says, ""We promote, uphold and support reverence and respect for human life without regard to condition, quality, age, race, religion, color or whether born or unborn.""On the National Right to Life page, the only reference to exceptions is a 2005 survey indicating only 0.5 percent of women have abortions due to rape, while 4 percent undergo it for the mother's health.Rader's campaign manager, Michael McCall, said, ""The problem with something like that is if you take an organization like Florida Right to Life, their very core is making abortion illegal. They won't list every case in which they support banning abortions, because they support banning abortions in all cases.""It's clear that groups supporting Benacquisto have firm stands against abortion, but they're not spelled out precisely. What is clear, though, is that the groups don't offer up any exceptions. So we don't expect Rader's campaign to find any.  We rate this claim Mostly True.","http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/video-campaign-ad-vote-no-on-lizbeth-benacquisto-998708.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tODVWh6i_MM,/personalities/viral-image/,/factchecks/2021/feb/10/viral-image/photo-shows-tampa-mayor-maskless-september-not-sup/,http://www.flacathconf.org/CQP2010/Responses/Benaquisto_Lizbeth.html,http://www.votelizbeth.com/news.php?id=11,http://www.votelizbeth.com/news.php?id=10,http://cfcoalition.com/full_article.php?article_no=172,http://frtl.homestead.com/,http://www.ccfla.org/protectinglife.php,http://www.cfcoalition.com/about_us.php,http://frtl.homestead.com/",,"Abortion,Message Machine 2010,Women,Florida,Kevin Rader",,,,,

You could say PolitiFact Florida just got lucky.We recently got our hands on an anonymous chain letter that landed in the in-box of Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact and Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times. It delved into the often dense worlds of campaign finance, congressional bailouts and tax policy — then beseeched voters to visit the campaign website of Florida Hometown Democracy.That’s one of two of main political action committees wielding millions of dollars in their battle over Amendment 4, a Florida constitutional proposal on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot that would put certain land use decisions directly before voters. Most of those millions — $10.5 million, in fact — have been raised by the main ""Vote No on 4"" effort.This e-mail purported to lift the veil on just whose cash had been flowing to ""Vote No on 4."" The biggest donor, it said, was the Florida Association of Realtors, followed by big home builders. Then came this claim, in all its bolded and underlined glory:  ""Here’s the killer: Many of the companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout, in the form of humongous tax refunds earlier this year."" It later added: ""So, when you see all those dire-sounding, fright-filled TV commercials, remember whose paying for them. You are.""E-mail forwards are a notoriously unreliable form of campaign rhetoric, so with a big choice looming Nov. 2, we decided to run the ""humongous tax refunds"" claim through the Truth-O-Meter.First we were curious about the source of the e-mail, since we want to give the person behind a claim the chance to support it. We asked Wayne Garcia, communications director for Florida Hometown Democracy, if it originated with the campaign.It wasn’t a campaign e-mail, he said — he’d never seen it before. However, the idea was nothing new, and he pointed us to some evidence. The Hometown Democracy campaign made similar claims in a news release on Aug. 12, 2010. It listed major ""Vote No on 4"" campaign contributors such as Pulte Homes, Lennar Homes and KB Home that it said benefited from ""billions in federal bailout money."" Garcia also pointed us to news articles by the New York Times, Reuters and Builder Magazine that explained the tax refunds.We got to work with a few key questions: Did companies actually get a ""bailout"" in the form of ""humongous tax refunds""? And did evidence about a handful of home builders support the claim that ""many of the companies"" behind ""Vote No on 4"" got a bailout?A bailout by any other nameFirst, the bailout question. Any ""rescue from financial distress"" qualifies as a bailout to us. And last year, the National Association of Home Builders did indeed lobby Congress for — and win — a change in tax law that it argued was a ""critical stimulus measure for the U.S. economy"" that would provide ""an infusion of monetary resources for firms struggling to retain workers and undertake economic activity.""Technically — skip forward a few sentences if this word makes your eyes glaze over — it supported an expansion of the net operating loss carryback period, allowing businesses with losses to carry back deductions for five years instead of just two. As a National Association of Home Builders report explained, ""The carryback option allows businesses to offset prior taxes paid, thereby generating tax refunds to finance ongoing expenses."" A two-year carryback was simply too short for builders, it argued, since many had suffered since late 2005. In a two-year period, it claimed, there wouldn’t necessarily be enough taxable income to offset builders’ financial trauma.Small businesses had scored this benefit in the stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. But big companies wanted to get in the game. The home builders’ association projected the change was potentially worth billions.President Barack Obama handed it to them Nov. 6, 2009, when he signed the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act. A New York Times column proclaimed days later ""Home Builders (You Heard That Right) Get a Gift."" Builder Magazine added up the lucre in February 2010: Nearly $2 billion in total tax refunds for the last three months of 2009.Not content to rely on secondhand sources, we spot-checked records ourselves, finding references to the new tax benefits in public filings. The general story held up. PulteGroup did indeed report an $800 million boost in fourth quarter 2009. KB Home reported an income tax benefit of $191.7 million, as reported in the Builder Magazine and Hometown Democracy charts. Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter Lennar Corp. number wasn't as easy to come by. While the charts said $251.1 million, Builder Magazine editor John Caulfield told us Oct. 27 that he was looking at the wrong report as he prepared his story. Lennar did say it expected a tax refund for the year of $320 million, though didn't appear to break out a fourth-quarter tax benefit.We also confirmed ""Vote No on 4"" campaign contributions from builders named in the Florida Hometown Democracy news release. Many were heavy hitters: A query to a Florida Division of Elections database for contributors who’ve handed over more than $100,000 each to fight the direct democracy initiative shows Pulte Homes Corp., Lennar Family of Builders, KB Home and more.(PulteGroup, for the record, said its commitment to oppose Amendment 4 ""was made in 2009 prior to the receipt of any tax refund."")Beyond the buildersFlorida Hometown Democracy’s August press release broke out just 12 builders as specific examples of companies that benefited from the tax change and contributed to ""Vote No on 4."" It pointed out that private companies wouldn’t have to reveal their tax records.So we wondered: Would the word ""many"" in the claim hold up under scrutiny?Well, here’s twist No. 1.It wasn’t just builders that benefited from the 2009 tax change. We called Steven Friedman, national director of home building services for Ernst & Young, who explained that the carryback provision applied to nearly everyone, companies and individuals alike.Other than industries with special rules such as finance or insurance — and companies that already benefited from TARP funds — anyone with the appropriate losses and prior taxable income could benefit, he said.""The point is, this was a very broad-based change in the law,"" he said. ""This was not a rifle shot targeted to Wall Street, to home builders, take your pick.""We had crunched the campaign contributor data, which showed more than 1,000 contributions to the main ""Vote No on 4"" political action committee, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. When we pulled out individuals and industry and lobbying groups, such as leading donor Florida Association of Realtors Advocacy Fund, about 430 contributions were left, primarily from companies. The most common self-identified occupations included construction, development and real estate.Did ""many"" of those companies benefit from the tax refund ""bailout?"" We would have to know whether they had suffered the appropriate losses in 2008 or 2009 and previously had taxable income to offset. We could make an educated guess that it was likely for builders, developers and real estate companies, given the recession, but without intensive research — and likely stonewalls in the case of private companies — we couldn’t know for sure.The final twist               If we could only talk with the originator of the chain e-mail claim, perhaps we would discover a powerful act of database journalism that cross-linked every business that contributed to ""Vote No on 4"" with any refunds supercharged by the 2009 tax law change.As it was, we were making some leaps — names weren’t usually an identical match. PulteGroup, for example, recorded the $800 million tax benefit. Pulte Homes Group made the $567,000 political donation.Then we found the author. Well, sort of.An Internet search on ""humongous tax refunds"" turned up the source, all right: novelist and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen. But he had nothing to do with the chain e-mail.Instead, someone had borrowed liberally from his Oct. 9, 2010, column, ""Running scared over Amendment 4."" Hiaasen, who takes shady Florida developers to task in his novels, used this column to shake a finger at special interests for their attacks on Amendment 4. He connected big-builder contributors to those tax refunds. He told his readers: ""These guys are using your money to keep your voice, and your vote, out of the neighborhood planning process.""PolitiFact Florida got Hiaasen on the phone.""The tax refunds these companies got were well documented,"" he said. True.But could he confirm that ""many"" companies that contributed got the bailouts?""It depends on your definition of many,"" he said.It would be great if someone would cross-check those contributors with data on tax refunds, he offered. He could do it, just not immediately.But he had been struck that builders, who contributed to the over-development that brought on the real estate collapse in the first place, had benefited from an act of Congress — and now opposed a measure that would give voters a say in their work.""When you start taking handouts from the government and then suddenly have enough money to get politically involved at this level, with this much cash going in, I think you need to be accountable, and I think the public needs to know where their bailout dollars are going,"" he said.But he didn’t have that dreamy database we’d been hoping for.So what does the Truth-O-Meter make of all this?First, what we can confirm: Some companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout in the form of tax refunds.What no one has yet proved, though it seems likely: ""Many.""Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021What we won’t rule on: ""Humongous."" While hundreds of millions of dollars sounds large to us, that’s a value judgment best reserved for opinion columns and novels.The statement we’re ruling on relies on finding companies that both got and gave, not on establishing a link between the cash flows. We don’t define ""many"" but we confirmed at least ""some"" — just 12 builders represent nearly $2 million for ""Vote No on 4,"" about 18 percent of the money raised. We find it valuable context that companies far beyond home builders, Realtors and developers also benefited from this tax change — even, say, newspaper companies. We rule this claim Half True. Though if Mr. Hiaasen comes up with that magical database, we’d be happy to reconsider.UPDATE: John Caulfield, who graciously acknowledged his mistake on a Lennar number, later showed us one of our own errors.

Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin.""Well, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work.First up: Is Oregon ""grizzly country""?That all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they’re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s.If, however, they’re talking about ""Grizzly Bear,"" the popular indie band, they’re way off. The band played in Portland last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a quick listen to ""The Knife,"" our favorite song of theirs.)Seriously, we might have to leave the whole ""grizzly country"" designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer.Is Parrish really one of Palin’s mama grizzlies?To get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a video of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look.The anchor frames the TV spot as follows: ""Well, Sarah Palin says they're like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time.""There’s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says ""It's kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half.""Then we’re back to the anchor, who says, ""And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies.""We got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. ""The focus was supposed to be moms and politics,"" she said. ""I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that.""Still, you can find the video on her website, and she didn’t object on the air.But is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren’t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn’t even endorsed her, as far we can tell.So where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There’s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a ""mama grizzly"" in that she’s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent.

And, it made him rich enough to help finance his campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District.Sutton, with help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has countered by questioning the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire.Sutton's TV advertising has cited lawsuits filed against Ganley dealerships. PolitiFact Ohio examined those claims and noted that while her numbers were correct, the information was presented without context. Specifically, the ad cited large numbers of lawsuits filed against Ganley without noting that he’s been in business four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer.""Buyer Beware,"" a TV ad from the DCCC, added the claims that Ganley has ""two F's from the Better Business Bureau"" and ""over 160 complaints in just three years.""PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine these assertions and, again, tried to put them in perspective.We started with the letter grades from the Better Business Bureau.The BBB called them ""another tool to use"" in choosing a business, and said that the grades are based on 17 different factors that include the time a business has been in operation and how it has handled complaints. An especially important factor is a business's responsive to complaints cited by the BBB.The BBB did give F ratings to two Ganley dealerships, primarily for failing to respond to six complaints filed against them during the bureau's ""standard reporting period"" of three years, and for false claims in advertising.But in the BBB’s online listings, the average grade for the 20 Ganley dealerships was a B+. That rating compared favorably to the per-store average of four other dealer groups we surveyed (Spitzer, Classic, Liberty and Cincinnati-based Joseph).The grades undergo continuing review and revision, and they have changed since the DCCC's ad. One F grade was upgraded to a B-. The second was withdrawn, replaced with ""no rating"" and is listed as under review. A third dealership, not rated earlier, was given an F.As for complaints, the BBB says, ""There is no known industry standard for the number of complaints a business can expect. The volume of business and number of transactions may have a bearing on the number of complaints received by the BBB.""Over 42 years in business, Ganley has sold 585,211 cars and served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, said Meghan Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ganley's campaign. ""He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades.""We found that its average of almost nine complaints per store, about three per year, was slightly higher than the average for the four other groups we looked at, and that a larger number of complaints involved ""selling practices.""Warning consumers about one practice, the BBB's website says that several of the dealerships may offer a ""conditional delivery agreement"" or ""spot delivery agreement"" to car buyers.Signing such an agreement permits the consumer to take the new vehicle home before financing has been approved,"" the BBB warns. ""Although offered as a 'convenience' to consumers, these agreements can often create problems if the consumer interprets them to mean the final terms of the car purchase will be as originally promised.""Those agreements led to several of the lawsuits against Ganley dealerships, such as one filed by a couple who said they took a new car home after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent.So let’s check the scorecard.Featured Fact-checkOhio House Republican Organizational Committeestated on October 13, 2010 in an election ad""Matt Patten kicked off his dirty campaign with thousands in dirty cash from guess who?

""Sounds nice. But Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia.""Deal's proof is an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article from Nov. 8, 2001. The story detailed a meeting between Barnes, who was governor at the time, and then Mexican President Vicente Fox in Mexico City. Barnes is reported as saying that Georgia's experience with a fast-growing immigrant population has generally been beneficial.""The labor we have received, primarily Mexicans, has fueled our economy,"" Barnes said.He added: ""We could not have had the Olympics in 1996 had it not been for that.""The Barnes campaign called the Deal ad a distortion of Barnes' position on immigrants legally working in the United States.""Barnes praised 'immigration,' not illegal immigration, as having been 'beneficial' as it 'fueled our economy,' "" the Barnes campaign said in a statement. ""He urged President Bush to 'work [immigration] out' because 'governors can't control immigration policy.' ""Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson countered that it is disingenuous for the Barnes campaign to accuse Deal's ad of stretching the truth here. Barnes was certainly aware that most immigrant workers were not here legally, Robinson said.""For him to imply otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test,"" Robinson said. ""What percentage of that work force meets that criteria [of being in the U.S. legally]?""We took a look. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that in 2009, there were slightly more than 28,000 people in Georgia who were legal permanent residents or ""green card"" holders. The federal agency also tries to keep track of how many people are living illegally in the U.S. About 480,000 illegal immigrants were living in Georgia in 2009, according to Homeland Security estimates, and in 2000 the estimated total was 220,000. The Homeland Security report does not have a breakdown of what percentage of people living in Georgia illegally are from Mexico. Nationwide, Homeland Security estimates that 62 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Mexico. Applied to Georgia in 2000, that would be 136,400 illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presumably a large number of those were workers.Barnes was in Mexico in 2001 for a four-day trade mission. Mexico was Georgia's third-largest trading partner, and Georgia companies were exporting $1 billion in products to that nation. State officials estimated at the time that Latino-owned businesses in Georgia had about $1.3 billion a year in annual sales. Some of Georgia's business titans, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, came on the trip.Barnes told a story in the 2001 AJC article about farmers in South Georgia, where he said ""it's about as conservative as you can get,"" who wanted him to get health coverage for ""migrant farmworkers."" The governor noted the presidents of the United States and Mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented Mexican workers.""Old ideas have changed,"" Barnes said.But since then attitudes toward illegal immigration have hardened, as highlighted by a poll that found 68 percent of Georgians support Arizona-type restrictions and enforcement of illegal immigration laws. And many politicians do not want to appear soft on the issue.Barnes said during a July debate that he would support an Arizona-type law in the Peach State to fight illegal immigration. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that has since gone before the courts that allows state and local law enforcement officers to ask people stopped for possible crimes to show proof they are in the United States legally.Deal's first television ad, in July, slammed President Barack Obama over illegal immigration, promised Georgia would soon have an Arizona-type law and said he doesn't care what ""liberals"" think. Robinson accused Barnes of running from his ""liberal record"" with his support of the Arizona legislation. ""He is all over the board on this,"" Robinson said.Andra Gillespie, an assistant political science professor at Emory University, explained that Barnes is trying to cut into Deal's conservative base by taking a stand on illegal immigration that is seemingly popular with most Georgia voters. Gillespie said the Deal statement that Barnes ""proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia"" is misleading.""Nathan Deal's campaign knows very well that when Roy Barnes went to Mexico and praised the contributions of Mexican immigrants [presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy], he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration,"" the professor said. ""But because Barnes did not specify his support for legal immigrant workers, the Deal campaign is taking advantage of the ambiguity and trying to fill in the blanks for voters.""Featured Fact-checkTom Cottonstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.""By Miriam Valverde • February 3, 2021We believe the Deal ad does accurately convey the quotes from Barnes in the 2001 AJC article. However, it's unclear that Barnes was talking specifically about illegal immigrants and, moreover, Barnes uttered the quotes nine years ago in a different political and economic climate. It doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes supports Mexican labor in Georgia today. So the ad lacks context that might give viewers a different impression.

Efforts to reach the O'Donnell campaign were unsuccessful.The ad phrases this claim in two slightly different ways. The narrator says that Coons ""thought that a 911 call should be taxed."" And as the narrator says that, the screen shows the text: ""Proposed a 911 Cell Phone Fee.""Before we critique the ad's accuracy, let's provide some background on the financing of 911 services, provided by Brian Fontes, the chief executive of the National Emergency Number Association, the group that represents 911 call centers and the vendors who service them.In theory, 911 services can simply be funded through a jurisdiction's general tax revenues, and in some places that is what's done. But more commonly, jurisdictions use either a tariff (that is, a levy approved by a telephone regulatory commission) or a fee (a levy often approved by an elected body such as a city council, a county council or a state legislature).Either way, the tariff or the fee appears as a line item on a customer's phone bill. Typically, users will see a standard amount assessed each month on any phone registered in a given jurisdiction. Fontes said that these levies tend not to be officially referred to as a ""tax,"" but we think it's fair for O'Donnell to characterize it that way, since we expect most people wouldn't know what a 911 ""tariff"" is.As cell phones have become more common, they have overtaken land lines in the number of calls made to 911. That is especially true now because most cell phones can electronically route a call directly to the appropriate local 911 line, even if the phone is registered out of state. Nationally, Fontes said, cell phones make about 60 percent of 911 calls, and that percentage is growing by the year.In a 2007 story, Delaware's biggest newspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, quoted Dave Roberts, New Castle County's chief of emergency communications, saying that instead of getting ""one or two calls on an incident on the turnpike, now we get 20 to 30 calls,"" he said. ""When people see an emergency like that, they want to play their part."" It's helpful, Roberts added, because some witnesses will have information that others missed, such as the color or model of a fleeing car.This has had an impact on how jurisdictions pay for 911 services. Since cell phones are a relatively recent invention, jurisdictions have had to write new laws or regulations to finance 911 calls through levies on cell phones, rather than just longstanding 911 fees on landlines.That's what happened in New Castle County in 2007.In early 2007, when Coons was assembling his county's budget proposal, he told the Wilmington News Journal in a March 17, 2007, article that ""he plans to approach the General Assembly this spring for authority to create new revenue streams, such as a hotel tax, a 911 cell-phone fee and a paramedic-service fee."" (Coons wouldn't have been able to implement the fee on his own -- it needed approval of the state legislature.)Later News Journal stories elaborated on the details. Coons wanted to increase the existing 911 excise tax on landlines from 60 cents a month to $1.00 and to impose, for the first time, a $1.00 monthly excise tax for 911 on cell phones. The newspaper quoted estimates that this could raise $3 million a year. The law passed in 2007.So where does O'Donnell's ad fit into this?The ad is correct that Coons proposed a tax to fund 911 services. But it adds some layers of obfuscation to this grain of truth.First, the ad is misleading when it implies that Coons strode into a tax-free oasis of 911 service and decided to impose a tax for the first time. Landlines had long been taxed to support 911 service. What Coons did was extend the tax to cell phones after their use to call 911 surged.Second, and probably more important, the ad is misleading about what exactly Coons proposed to do. The ad says that Chris Coons ""thought that a 911 call should be taxed."" We think most people would understand that to mean that every time they dialed 911, they would be hit by a tax. But that's not the case. Instead, Coons' proposed tax would have been a monthly levy on each user's bill, regardless of whether someone called 911 or not. No one needed to worry that calling 911 to help an injured motorist on the highway would lead to a special fee on their next phone bill. O'Donnell's ad twisted the details of a proposed 911 levy to fit her image of Coons as an insatiable tax monster. Yes, he proposed a tax, but for a service on which other phones already were being taxed. And Coons most certainly did not propose taxing individual 911 calls.

Charlie Crist is still talking about those budget ""earmarks"" Marco Rubio tried to stick in the state budget.Back when Crist was running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, he claimed that Rubio, as House speaker, tried to direct $800,000 to a South Florida sports group to place artificial turf on a flag football field where Rubio played. PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True, noting that Rubio didn't sponsor the specific appropriation, but supported it by voting for the budget.Then on Sept. 20, 2010, the new no-party Crist began airing a TV ad criticizing Rubio for inserting $800,000 for a turf field and $1.5 million for a rowing institute. We found even less evidence -- in fact we found none -- that Rubio had anything to do with the rowing institute appropriation and ruled the claim Pants on Fire!On Oct. 6, 2010, during the first prime-time debate between Crist, Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek, Crist again brought up the earmark issue. Midway through the debate, which was moderated by George Stephanopoulos and broadcast on ABC stations across the state, a panelist asked Crist whether he thought his opponents deserved to be on a national corrupt candidates list.Crist said that he wouldn't say whether Rubio was corrupt (""That's for other people to decide."") But Crist said Rubio put questionable things in the budget, like ""$800,000 for an AstroTurf field on -- for a flag football field that he plays on-- in Miami.""""Is that corrupt? Is it wrong? It's clearly wrong, in my view. That's why I had to veto some things,"" Crist said.Rubio was prepared for the attack.""First of all, let's set the record straight. The things he's absolutely said are just not true,"" Rubio said. ""I had nothing to do with the flag football field.""The second thing is that he says I steered money -- all these things are false allegations. The fact is that the years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered. Leaner budgets than the Senate offered. If you-- if you wanted a leaner budget, you should have lined up behind our budget. Our budget was even leaner than yours.""Crist never responded to Rubio's claim about the budget, but the claim had us wondering: Despite all this tough talk by Crist about earmarks and vetoing pet projects, did Rubio actually propose smaller state budgets than the governor?A quick bit of background. The governor each year proposes a budget to legislators prior to the spring legislative session. But it's the House and Senate that actually craft the state budget plan. Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of the budget, then work together to reconcile those differences. After a final budget is approved by the Legislature, it is sent on to the governor, who has the power of a line-item veto -- meaning the governor can veto specific appropriations and programs from the budget without having to veto the budget in its entirety.The state Constitution requires that the state budget be balanced.Crist was elected governor in 2006, and has presented budgets in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Rubio served as House speaker during Crist's first two budget years, in 2007 and 2008, so those are the two years we will be comparing.2007 -- Crist's first budget as governor, Rubio's first as speakerOn Feb. 5, 2007, Crist proposed a $71.2 billion state budget that included $20 million for stem cell research, $32.5 million to establish a voter paper trail and $50 million for ethanol research and manufacturing. But the proposal was short-lived. Souring economic and tax collection data forced Crist to amend his budget recommendations a little more than a month later. Crist revised his budget request on March 15, cutting approximately $473 million in spending. The new proposed spending plan totaled $70.8 billion. (For consistency, we have rounded the overall budget numbers to one decimal place).The House leadership, led by Rubio as speaker and Ray Sansom as budget council chair, released a $70.2 billion budget program less than two weeks later. The budget that actually passed on April 11 was a little bigger, totaling $70.3 billion. That's about $500 million or .7 percent less than what Crist proposed.In negotiations with the Senate, the state budget grew. On April 30, Senate and House leaders settled on a $71.9 billion spending plan. Crist wound up vetoing more than $400 million in projects from the Legislature's budget, including $800,000 for artificial turf for a South Florida football field. (The budget ended up being cut by nearly $1.2 billion during a special session because of declining tax revenues, and another $500 million during the 2008 regular session).To us, the key to the 2007 comparison of the Crist and Rubio-led budget proposals is looking at the revised recommendation of Crist (about $70.8 billion) and the version that Rubio ultimately shepherded through the House (about $70.3 billion). We think it's fair to use the $70.3 billion figure because Rubio controlled a Republican-dominated House and could easily have decided to stick with the lower $70.2 billion original proposal if he wanted.Conversely, we don't think it's fair to saddle Rubio with the budget that came out of negotiations with the Senate. Nor do we think it's appropriate to consider Crist's original proposal, which came when economic conditions were different and a month and a half before Rubio unveiled his spending plan. Using those two numbers then, $70.3 billion for Rubio and $70.8 billion for Crist, Rubio indeed proposed spending less than Crist. But not by much.2008 -- Crist's second budget as governor, Rubio's last as speakerOn Jan. 31, 2008, Crist proposed a $70 billion budget, a small decrease from the budget approved in 2007.""As a nation, we are facing extraordinary economic times,"" Crist said in announcing his budget recommendations. ""However, we can be certain that Florida's brightest days are ahead of us. It is especially important — now more than ever — for government to spend the people's money wisely and live within our means, just as Florida's families do every day.""Crist's proposed budget added about $1 billion for education, and dipped into trust funds and reserves for about $1.1 billion in order to balance the budget. Crist's budget included a 2 percent pay raise for state workers, allocated $300 million to an environmental land buying program called Florida Forever and sent $46.9 million to expand public health centers.His ideas got an icy reception from leaders in the House, particularly Rubio, who argued against using reserves to plug budget holes and instead advocated eliminating and merging functions of some state agencies.""We must balance our budget by living within our means,"" he said. ""We should not spend money that we do not have. And we should not rely on gimmicks.""As the calendar turned from January to February and then to March, Crist's budget became less and less realistic, as state revenue projections continued to plummet. By March 12, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the state would receive $3 billion less in revenue than was anticipated when Crist proposed his budget.Crist said the grim numbers helped advance his position to use one-time reserves to balance the budget without raising taxes.And Rubio persisted that the government needed to cut spending.That takes us to March 31, the day the House unveiled its budget proposal. The House advocated for a $65.1 billion budget, which would cut 7.5 percent from the current budget.The House proposal cut per-student funding $86, eliminated about 1,000 state jobs, and stripped money out of the Florida Forever program. A $65 billion budget plan eventually passed the House along party lines on April 10.The House and Senate eventually agreed to send a $66.2 billion budget to Crist. Crist ultimately vetoed only $1 million in projects -- $300,000 for a lake restoration program in Central Florida and $840,000 for a Miami festival promoting ties with Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community.The differences between the House and Crist's proposed budgets in 2008 are more stark than they were in 2007. Crist proposed a larger budget of around $70 billion by tapping trust funds. The House budget was leaner by $5 billion (or more than 7 percent), and relied less on trust funds and more on spending cuts. We should note that Rubio and the House did have the advantage of being able to wait two months after Crist to release their budget proposal. In those two months, revenue projections plummeted, necessitating smaller budgets.Our rulingAll this budget talk started with an argument over earmarks in the budget, and more generally, who can stake a claim to being the better fiscal conservative -- Charlie Crist or Marco Rubio.Rubio says the House budgets he proposed in 2007 and 2008 were ""leaner budgets than the governor offered.""Rubio is largely right, though his claim could use a little additional information. In 2007, the budgets offered by Rubio and Crist ultimately were pretty similar, with the difference being just about $500 million in a budget totaling more than $70 billion. The budgets in 2008 were significantly different, however, primarily because Crist wanted to use trust funds to help balance a bigger budget. Rubio advocated cutting state spending to make the budget smaller. It's also worth noting that state revenue projects took a turn for the worse in between when Crist proposed his budget in 2008, and when Rubio and the House proposed theirs.

""More lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in Juarez alone, just a few blocks from the United States of America, than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Over the past couple of years, more than 2,400 people in Juarez alone have been killed because of the drug cartel war, more than 5,000 across the country of Mexico. It is more dangerous to walk the streets of Juarez a few blocks from El Paso than it is to walk the streets of Baghdad.""Drug violence surged in Mexico in 2008, when the death toll doubled that of 2007, according to a January 2009 CNN story. A September 2008 memo from the U.S. Consulate General in Juarez warns Americans from traveling in Chiuahua due to ""an increase in violent criminal activity fueled by a war between drug cartels.""First we wondered whether Baghdad is really safer than Juarez, but one security expert suggested that would be a subjective call. The death toll is one indicator of how dangerous a city is, but there are other variables, said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company. ""Safe for whom and safe from what?"" he asked.For now, we decided to focus on whether more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than in the war in Afghanistan.Regarding the death toll in Juarez, Jerry Strickland, Abbott's spokesman, sent us links to three news stories and two government websites enumerating those killed in the border city across from El Paso.A Feb. 1 crime and safety report on Juarez posted on the federal Overseas Security Advisory Council website says that ""although Mexican media and government sources offer varying crime statistics, most sources report at least 2,640 murders committed in and around the city in 2009, up from 1,600 in 2008 and 300 in 2007 ... Violent crime is part of everyday life in Ciudad Juarez. However, the surge in homicides has mostly involved fighting between cartels and street gangs, or between cartels and security forces. Victims without direct involvement in organized crime represent only a small percentage of overall homicides.""From a July 13 Reuters story: ""The daily killings have become so normal they have almost ceased to shock. Unless Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, bucks all previous indicators and undergoes a dramatic security turnaround, the death toll from the drug war raging in the city since January 2008 will reach 6,000 people this month. That is more than all the dead serving in the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan.""And McClatchy, citing the Diario newspaper in Juarez, reported in June that between January and June 27, the death toll rose to 1,363, up from 871 during that same period in 2009, and 520 in 2008.Relying on that information, Strickland told us that more than 5,733 people have been killed since January 2008.Stewart, at Stratfor, had slightly different numbers: 4,677 deaths in Juarez from January 2009 through August 2010.So, it seems that since January 2008, at least 3,000 to 5,000 people at least have been killed in Juarez. Since deaths unrelated to drug violence were nominal, according to the Overseas Security Advisory Council, Abbott's figure on Fox — at least 2,400 killed in Juarez in connection with the cartels — sounds conservative.Featured Fact-checkMarco Rubiostated on January 27, 2021 in remarks""Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.”By Miriam Valverde • January 29, 2021What about Afghanistan?Strickland pointed us to military death tolls for 2008-10 on CNN.com, which has mapped U.S. coalition casualties in Afghanistan by age, location and date. During 2008 and 2009, 808 were killed in Afghanistan, according to the site. As of Oct. 4, 542 people had been killed in 2010. However, Strickland said 239 were killed as of June 1, bringing total military deaths to about 1,50 troops when he made his claim on Fox in July.Including civilian casualties tracked by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, we found that 5,880 were killed in Afghanistan between 2008-10 — keeping in mind that our tally includes deaths that happened after Abbott made his statement. Abbott calculated 5,475 total casualties during the same time period.But the war in Afghanistan has lasted much longer than three years — the United States invaded in October 2001.When we asked Abbott's office why he limited the number killed in Afghanistan from 2008 to date, Strickland said it was an ""apples to apples comparison in terms of time frame.""That might be so, but Abbott flatly told Van Susteren that more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Just because the violence in Mexico surged in the past couple years isn't reason to disregard those killed in Afghanistan prior to 2008.According to the U.S. Department of Defense, as of Sept. 27, 1,291 Americans had been killed as a result of the war in Afghanistan, including two civilian casualties, and 94 who were killed outside of Afghanistan. According to the CNN page that Strickland cites, 2,115 U.S. troops and coalition forces have been killed since 2001 (11 were killed that year).Stewart suggested we check iCasualties.org, a website that tracks military casualties, for a fuller picture of total deaths in Afghanistan: that tally was 2,128 when we looked at the site Oct. 4.Next, we looked at United Nations' data for civilian casualties since 2007, the earliest record we found. About 1,520 civilians died that year — about 6,050 since 2007.So even with limited information on how many civilians have been killed in Afghanistan, it seems at least 8,000 people have died as a result of the war since 2001.Where does that leave us?By Abbott's calculation, cobbled from various news and government reports, 258 more people were killed in Juarez than in Afghanistan between 2008 and this past summer, when Abbott appeared on Fox. But that's not what he said. He said more people have died as result of the drug war in Juarez, dating a couple years back, than have died as a result of the war in Afghanistan. That war started in 2001, and far as we can tell, more people have died from it.We rate Abbott's statement False.","http://www.stratfor.com/,/personalities/marco-rubio/,/factchecks/2021/jan/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-falsely-claims-former-leaders-are-pros/",,"Afghanistan,Immigration,Crime,Texas,Greg Abbott",,,,,

Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., delivered one of her signature hard-hitting speeches at the Values Voter Summit, a conference for socially conservative activists on Sept. 17, 2010. At one point, Bachmann took a shot at the woman who leads her chamber, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Pelosi, Bachmann said, ""has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."" Bachmann was referring to the Air Force jets that Pelosi uses to fly internationally and back to her home in San Francisco. (Her Republican predecessor, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, used them as well, under a program approved under President George W. Bush.)Bachman's claim drew a rapid counterattack from the Speaker's office, as aides revived arguments they'd used when the allegation first surfaced months earlier. Among other things, Pelosi's office noted that the Speaker ""does not drink alcohol"" and that there ""is no alcohol service on the domestic flights the Air Force operates for travel from Washington to San Francisco for the Speaker.""Two politicians diverging over the facts? Sounds like a job for PolitiFact.We tracked down the original source of Bachmann's allegation, which was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues.In a press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that ""the Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol.""The release gave as an example one Congressional delegation that traveled from Washington through Tel Aviv to Baghdad between May 15, 2008, and May 20, 2008, ""to discuss matters of mutual concern with government leaders."" The purchases included ""Johnny Walker Red scotch, Grey Goose vodka, E&J brandy, Bailey’s Irish Crème, Maker’s Mark whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Bacardi Light rum, Jim Beam whiskey, Beefeater gin, Dewars scotch, Bombay Sapphire gin, Jack Daniels whiskey, Corona beer and several bottles of wine,"" the release said.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton seized on the party-plane theme. ""Speaker Pelosi has a history of wasting taxpayer funds with her boorish demands for military travel,"" Fitton was quoted as saying in the release. ""And these documents suggest the Speaker’s congressional delegations are more about partying than anything else.""Other critics of Pelosi piled on soon after the Judicial Watch documents came to light. World Net Daily, a conservative website, led its article by saying that the purchases for the 2008 trip ""reads like a dream order for a wild frat party ... But that single receipt makes up just part of the more than $101,000 taxpayers paid for 'in-flight services' -– including food and liquor -- for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""To Pelosi's critics, it must be irresistible to paint a rival as someone who leads debauched lawmakers on cushy overseas trips, only to stick taxpayers with the bill. But Bachmann's version of the facts is way off base.Bachmann said at the Values Voter Summit that Pelosi ""has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."" To us, Bachmann is clearly saying that Pelosi has spent $100,000 specifically on alcohol -- but that interpretation doesn't fly with the Judicial Watch summary.The news release said that the $101,429.14 amount was for ""in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol."" But our friends at the website FactCheck.org determined that the sum spent on alcohol is a small proportion of that amount and that not all of the expenses were in-flight. ""It’s clear that Judicial Watch is counting as 'in-flight expenses' any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditure besides transportation costs,"" FactCheck.org wrote. ""That category actually includes all non-plane costs of the trip, including baggage fees, meeting room rentals and refreshments, and, frequently, good-will lapel pins — as well as meals, ground transportation and lodging in U.S. territory.""A spokeswoman for Judicial Watch confirmed to PolitiFact that ""the tab amount includes, but is not limited to, alcohol and food.""Incidentally, the receipt that was the source of the ""frat party"" jab in World Net Daily, and which was also linked to in Judicial Watch's press release, shows a decidedly more modest pricetag for the ""bar tab"" -- namely, $560.28, purchased at what appears to have been a no-frills base exchange at Maryland's Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, D.C.The full receipt isn't reproduced in the FOIA documents, so we can't be sure what percentage is food and what percentage is alcohol. But even if you use the full amount to extrapolate the total paid for alcohol, it doesn't come close to $100,000 Bachmann says. If Pelosi is to be believed that no alcohol is served on her domestic flights (which account for most of the flights she took as Speaker) and if you agree with FactCheck.org that she took a total of 12 international trips, then the total cost of alcohol would have been something less than $7,000, far lower than Bachmann's $100,000.It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip.

We are one of the highest taxed states in the country.""",,politifact,,"Jobs and taxes are top issues in this year’s state and national elections, with politicians banging daily on related themes in speeches, news releases and campaign ads. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich amplified his tax message recently with the claim that Ohioans pay more taxes than people in most other states.While he frequently makes the statement on the campaign trail, the claim is the stinger in his latest campaign television ad that began airing statewide Aug. 22.""You can’t raise taxes in Ohio. We are one of the highest taxed states in the country ... If you raise prices in the state you drive taxpayers away.""  Kasich made similar claims Sept. 14 during the first gubernatorial debate with Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, which makes the issue worth examining  now.The statement, Kasich says, refers to an individual’s tax burden – the sum of state and local taxes, such as property taxes and local sales taxes, that an individual pays. And he specifically uses a ranking by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, which regularly crunches state and local tax data.The Tax Foundation ranks Ohio’s total tax burden seventh highest, according to its 2008 study, the most recent available. Among 50 states, seventh qualifies in our book as ""one of the highest.""But the ranking deserves more discussion because of an ongoing debate among tax experts about how to best evaluate or measure the total tax burden.The Tax Foundation first combines state and local tax collections, and makes projections, or estimates, for the year the study is completed. The Tax Foundation also considers taxes Ohioans may pay in other states, and vice versa. It then divides the state’s total tax collections by total personal income.Translated: the average Ohioan pays about 10.4 percent of their income to state and local taxes compared to the national average of 9.7 percent. Ohio takes a hit in the Tax Foundation study because of its relatively high income tax rate.Other tax experts, including those at the Federation of Tax Administrators, agree that combining state and local taxes and dividing that by total personal income offers a reasonable way to look at the burden. But these experts stick with the raw U.S. Census data without making any adjustments or projections.Ohio has the 16th highest total tax burden -- all state and local taxes -- as a percentage of personal income, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators’ crunching of U.S. Census numbers. That ranking moves Ohio from the top quarter of highest taxed states to the top third, giving the state a bit more cover.And even in its purest form, the Federation of Tax Administrators say, U.S. Census data can be misleading because not all taxes are ""tied to personal income and the scope neglects certain types of state economic activity."" You can read its analysis of measurement methods here.The Ohio Tax Department likes to brag about another view of tax-burden numbers offered this year, also by the Federation of Tax Administrators, but one that only looks at state taxes. By that measure, Ohio has the 33th highest state tax burden as a percentage personal income. That means only 17 other states collected a lower percentage of taxes than Ohio. But beware: this ranking looks only at the taxes imposed by the state -- not those imposed by local authorities. So an equal comparison can’t be made to studies that examine both state and local taxes. Nonetheless, the ranking is instructive because it shows Ohio’s tax rating has improved since it began reducing personal income and business taxes in 2005. That year, Ohio ranked 28th in the study of the state-tax burden.And there are other ways to slice and dice the figures. We ran a simple Google search, ""total tax burden by state per capita,"" and immediately found another ranking. This one, from Statemaster, uses U.S. census data and excludes federal and local taxes from its rankings, focusing only on state tax collections. It ranks Ohio as having the 27th heaviest tax burden.So that brings us back to the nagging question: How should the tax burden be measured?Ohio’s Education Tax Policy Institute, a think-tank that defends the state and is led by school districts to analyze tax data and influence policies, argues that the Tax Foundation’s attempts to look beyond the U.S. Census data dooms its study. The institute makes its case in a paper entitled, ""More Tax Foundation Nonsense!"" which is available on its Web site.The Tax Foundation has battled back, offering lengthy rebuttals. Its argument, ""Wishful Thinking About Tax Burdens in Ohio,"" is available on the Tax Foundation Web site.The problem for voters is that tax experts will be debating the issue long beyond the election, so PolitiFact Ohio wants to keep Kasich’s claim in the context of the governor’s race. By citing the Tax Foundation study, Kasich is invoking several taxes the governor can’t easily influence – such as school levies passed by voters, or sales tax boosted by county commissioners – to paint Ohio’s tax picture as bleak. The claim also obscures the tangible improvements Ohio has made at the state level in reducing both business and personal income taxes since 2005, including a nearly 17 percent cut in personal income tax since then. These improvements were addressed in more detail in the June 17 PolitiFact Ohio article, ""Ted Strickland boasts Ohio’s small business climate is tops in the Midwest.""We think both are important points that help provide clarification about taxes in Ohio.One thing about Kasich’s claim is clear: by one measure, it’s accurate. But how to best define tax burden is cloudier, and a look at other research shows that answers and rankings can vary wildly depending on which taxes are included, which data sets are employed and which projectons are applied.For these reasons, we rate Kasich’s claim Half True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax.

America's energy industry supports 9 million jobs, but Congress may double-tax U.S. energy companies, helping foreign companies owned by China and Venezuela, even BP. New taxes will raise your gas prices, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and cost 600,000 American jobs. Tell Congress BP doesn't deserve a handout. No new American energy taxes.""At first, we thought this was an ad decrying the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal, a legislative effort to cap greenhouse gases that Republicans have consistently criticized as a tax on ordinary energy consumers. But that's not what the ad is about.Instead, NTU says the ad is about two changes under consideration by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress -- rules for ""dual capacity"" taxpayers, and the Section 199 deduction. The ad is correct that the modifications being considered would primarily affect oil and gas companies.Even by the byzantine standards of tax law, these rules are highly arcane. So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly. Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a ""handout"" to companies like BP.Let's start with the ""dual capacity"" rule.This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice. Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract. When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place. So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy. (The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term ""dual capacity."")Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar. So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes.Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense). This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure. But it gets complicated if the country either taxes ""dual capacity"" taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all.In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made ""taxes"" -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury of taxes. That's why President Barack Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget, and some senators have proposed tightening the rules. We won't get into the guts of the proposed changes here, but the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official, non-partisan arbiter of tax policy changes, found that Obama's proposal would collect an additional $8.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. Oil and gas companies aren't the only sector that would be affected, but they are the main companies that will.Now for the second proposal -- eliminating oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code. Section 199 is a deduction for companies that produce goods or software or undertake construction projects in the U.S. Passed in 2004, it replaced a previous tax benefit extended specifically to U.S. exporters, struck down as an illegal trade subsidy by the World Trade Organization. Under section 199, U.S. oil and gas companies can take advantage of a lower tax rate. According to Treasury Department testimony in 2009, making oil and gas ineligible is projected to increase federal revenues by $13.2 billion from 2010 to 2019.We won't address the ad's claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a ""handout"" to BP or other foreign companies.In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms.Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code. Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness. ""Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here. That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder.""Still, ""handout"" is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed. In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of ""handout"" is ""a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar."" Allowing for some artistic license to exchange ""BP"" for ""beggar,"" we think the accuracy of ""handout"" depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP. And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes.If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies. But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP? We're not so sure.Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term ""handout"" in this context is ""highly misleading,"" noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability. ""There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout,"" Kane said. ""If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?'""There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass. In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers. According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry. Still, we think the term ""handout"" in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding ""handouts"" for them. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.","http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/energy-environment/energytax-tvspot.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjxbzYNdGKE,https://www.politifact.com/subjects/cap-and-trade/,/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/,http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=3665,http://finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/091009aktest.pdf",,"National,Cap and Trade,Climate Change,Corporations,Energy,Environment,Foreign Policy,Message Machine 2010,Oil Spill,National Taxpayers Union",,,,,

McCaul serves on a similar panel advising House Republicans.We wondered whether McCaul's international comparison was on point.In its cost estimates for fiscal 2010, CMS notes that it distributes ""more benefits than any other federal agency"" — $803.1 billion in this fiscal year that runs through September. A CMS spokeswoman told us that figure still holds.Mike Rosen, a McCaul spokesman, pointed us to the International Monetary Fund, which publishes a report twice a year — most recently in April — analyzing global economic developments, including data on inflation, unemployment and countries' gross domestic product.The IMF estimated that this year, the United States has the largest GDP among 182 other countries, $14.79 trillion, followed by China ($5.36 trillion), Japan ($5.27 trillion) and Germany ($3.32 trillion).By that yardstick, Rosen said, CMS's annual spending would rank 16th among those countries, behind Korea's gross domestic product ($991 billion) and ahead of the Netherlands ($797 billion).Paul Van de Water, an analyst at Washington's liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed the CMS would rank 16th — the new health care law has little effect on Medicare and Medicaid spending this year — but said the billions in benefits merit some perspective.""The United States is a big country, and health care is much more expensive in the U.S. than anywhere else, so it's not surprising that health care for the elderly, disabled and poor costs a lot of money,"" Van de Water said. The United States has the world's third-largest population, according to the CIA World Factbook, behind China and India. ""U.S. government spending on national defense and homeland security will total about $750 billion this year; that number exceeds a lot of foreign GDPs, too, but the comparison provides no information about appropriate defense policy.""Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Van de Water said a more reasonable benchmark is the size of the U.S. economy. CMS ""estimates that total health care spending in the U.S., for all people and programs, in calendar year 2010 will equal 17.3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product,"" he said. ""Of that amount, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to equal 5.3 percent of GDP."" Defense spending: also about 5 percent.Thomas Saving, an economist and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University, agreed the GDP comparison would be more valuable. He noted that total health care expenditures in Japan, which has the world's the third-largest GDP, are about 9 percent of its GDP — or about half the U.S. ratio.Saving said McCaul's ""comparison has no useful information,"" pointing out that the population of the smaller economies are tiny when compared to the populations in countries with the largest GDPs — or states, for that matter. ""Another not useful fact is that (national) CMS benefits are smaller than the Texas state GDP,"" he added.""Social Security benefits are 4.8 percent of the U.S. GDP — also larger than most of the world's economies,"" Saving said. ""We are a big country in population and a rich country in per-capita GDP.Offering a less critical take, Brian Blase, a health policy analyst from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said McCaul's comparison illustrates a bigger point: ""The U.S. spends an awful lot on health care, primarily on Medicaid and Medicare. We spend more (total) on health care for seniors and poor people than most of the other countries could spend if they spent all their income.""However, Blase agreed McCaul's claim is ""somewhat misleading"" and said ""if you really want to do a comparison, you want to put it in per capita terms."" How come? Gross numbers can be misleading without context. For instance, China recently passed Japan as the country with the second highest GDP, but it's ""nowhere close to as wealthy as Japan right now because Japan's population is a fraction of the population of China,"" he said.Rosen of McCaul's office stood by the congressman's statement in an e-mail: ""We were not comparing our health care expenditures to that of other countries... The numbers are the numbers. 16th is 16th.""Our take? True, the CMS is poised to spend some $800 billion this year, more money than the size of all but 15 nations' economies.

But one in particular has small lawn services, work-at-home parents and the nation’s smallest businesses mighty concerned.

So is the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and even a Cleveland congressman who is generally Boehner’s ideological opposite.""This obviously was something that needed to be better thought out,"" said that congressman, Democrat Dennis Kucinich, in a telephone interview. ""It has to be fixed, and it will be fixed, because it’s not tolerable.""Businesses were already required to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 for payments of $600 or more for services they obtained, such as accounting or advertising advice. But according to the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, a watchdog arm of the IRS, the prior law ""generally did not require a person to report payments to purchase goods, presumably because the purchaser could not determine the amount that (less cost of goods sold) would have been income to the vendor.""And under ""a longstanding regulatory regime,"" the Taxpayer Advocate Service said in a June 30 report to Congress on a host of IRS-related tax issues, ""there was an exception for payments to corporations as well as to tax-exempt and government entities.""There had been earlier efforts to eliminate the corporate exemption, which would assure that even if a small business was paying in cash for a corporation’s services, the corporation could not avoid paying taxes. But the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- specifically in section 9006, amending the Internal Revenue Code -- went further by including goods as well as services.Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee figured this would help pay for part of the health care bill. Congressional Quarterly reported that  provision ""aims to discourage tax cheating by vendors in the form of not disclosing all of their income. The premise is that vendors are more likely to report all of their income and to pay all of the taxes they owe if their customers are telling the IRS, via form 1099, how much they are paying vendors in a given year.""How extensively would this affect businesses?Quite extensively, says the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The provision ""would apply to businesses of all sizes, charities and other tax-exempt organizations, and government entities.""  That includes  26 million non-farm sole proprietorships, 4 million S corporations, 2 million C corporations, 3 million partnerships, 2 million farming businesses, 1 million charities and other tax-exempt organizations, ""and probably more than 100,000 federal, state, and local government entities.""Small business owners would have to get Tax Identification Numbers or Employer Identification Numbers from their vendors -- and if a vendor refused to provide one, ""the business is required by law to impose back-up withholding at the rate of 28 percent of the purchase price,"" says the Taxpayer Advocate Service report.Let’s say you own a two-person landscaping company and want to buy $600 worth of mowers from a guy who refurbishes them in his spare time. He won’t give you his identification number. So you’re supposed to pay him $423 and withhold another $168, or 28 percent -- and file the appropriate withholding forms, of course.That’s assuming that the backyard repairman is willing to part with his mowers at this point in your transaction. In the words of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, this ""could significantly impair the normal course of commerce.""Boehner and fellow Republicans are using this provision to lampoon Democrats. Yet Democrats say they, too, want to get rid of the provision. The problem is that Democrats need to find a way to make up the revenue, estimated at $17 billion, if they give up this particular one..Before leaving for their August recess, House Democrats suggested a tax on multinational corporations  that move operations offshore, but that failed. Senate Democrats this fall may try to get some of the money by removing a manufacturing tax deduction from big oil and gas companies while keeping part of the provision intact. They would raise the reporting threshold to $5,000 and exempt companies with fewer than 25 employees.But as CQ reports, Senate Republicans have a different idea: Repeal the whole provision and soften the health care bill’s requirement that individuals buy insurance with, if needed, government subsidies. If the insurance bill were to cost less, it would reduce the need for this money, Republicans say.You may agree or disagree with any of these approaches, but the issue here is simply Boehner’s statement on the $600 reporting requirement. It’s about mom-and-pop stores and lawn-mowing services, and we rate it True.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 1, 2021 in a Facebook post“Biden signs 45% capital gains tax.

""You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names.""But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that.""Barnes has worked to live by his words, his campaign spokesman Emil Runge said.So Barnes thinks it's possible to run a respectful campaign. Has he run one?AJC PolitiFact Georgia pulled out its Flip-O-Meter, which we keep on our desk next to our Truth-O-Meter. Politicians commonly shift their positions over time, sometimes for good reasons. The Flip-O-Meter determines whether such a shift has taken place.  In an earlier item, PolitiFact Georgia ruled a claim by Barnes that he ran an all-positive TV ad campaign during the Democratic primary as Mostly True. His eight commercials generally took on a positive tone. They did not single out or criticize specific primary opponents, although he did take jabs at the state Legislature. At the time, Barnes didn't have to go negative. He polled way ahead of his challengers, and it was to his advantage to keep his party unified while Republicans squabbled.Times have changed. Recent polls put Barnes either behind Republican nominee Nathan Deal or in a dead heat. And when candidates are behind, they tend to run negative commercials, political experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia.Those experts agree with Barnes that it's important for a candidate to demonstrate how he differs from the competition. That's the whole point of campaigning. And if one candidate has serious, legitimate problems, his opposition should mention it.So what's negative campaigning? And how do you avoid it?It's hard to say, said Richard Lau, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has studied political messages for decades.""Negative"" is often in the eye of the beholder, Lau said. The candidate making the unflattering accusations thinks he's telling the truth. His rival thinks he's the victim of a negative attack.Deal does. Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said Barnes has run a ""100 percent"" negative television ad campaign since Deal clinched his party's nomination this month.Barnes' camp, however, thinks Georgians deserve to know about the issues the ads raise, Runge said.Further complicating things is that much of political rhetoric, even the milder stuff, is way out of line in everyday life. You'd think twice about telling a fellow parishioner at a church picnic that he has ethical problems. ""You wouldn't say this face to face to a friend or acquaintance,"" said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia.So AJC PolitiFact Georgia's yardstick is the etiquette of political discussion, not a church picnic. And we acknowledge there is a spectrum of ads that can be perceived as ""negative"" that includes outrageous, vicious lies on one end and legitimate comparisons at the other.Barnes' campaign has released three new TV commercials since the day of the runoff. In this item, we'll see whether he stays on the right side of the line.""The Newspaper Says"" Barnes' first post-primary ad, ""The Newspaper Says,"" came out Aug. 10, the day of the Republican gubernatorial runoff. ""This great state is falling behind,"" an announcer begins. A finger clicks through what appear to be newspaper articles on a touch-screen tablet computer about mortgage foreclosures, an ethics investigation and job losses. The headlines come from actual articles.""Do we continue down the same path, with the same team that gave us ethics violations, teacher furloughs, tax breaks to special interests, homes foreclosed and misplaced priorities? Or do we work our way back?"" the announcer asks. The ad is critical of ""the same team"" and ""more of the same,"" but the announcer doesn't portray any individual or government body in a negative light. All the issues it raises are real and stated accurately.""Newspapers Deal""Barnes' second ad, released Aug. 13, is much like the first one. The finger's there. So's the touch-screen. It opens with the same words: ""This great state is falling behind.""But this one calls out Deal by name, accusing him of being ""distracted"" with ""ethical charges"" as the state suffers.The ad closes with ""Nathan Deal: just more of the same.""Deal's name appears on a rusty real estate-type 'For Sale' sign, which breaks and tumbles to the ground.This ad raises ethics accusations against Deal that are well established by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news organizations. The headlines it uses come from actual articles. The description of the complaints is mindful of the fact that while a congressional ethics investigation found that Deal possibly violated U.S. House rules, he resigned from Congress in March before any formal accusation was made.The ad's finale strays from an everyday definition of ""polite,"" but overall, the ad is well-sourced and carefully worded. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel called Deal far worse in the Republican runoff.""Hiding""Barnes' ""Hiding,"" released Aug. 18, is his most aggressive so far. It gives Deal a loopy sound effect: a slide whistle.""Roy Barnes released 25 years of tax returns. Online,"" it says. ""Nathan Deal refuses to disclose his income taxes."" A cutout of Deal's head appears. His eyes and nose peer over the words: ""What is he hiding this time?"" That slide whistle blows, and the rusty real estate sign breaks apart once more. Then comes the unflattering slogan from the last commercial: ""Nathan Deal. Just more of the same.""Deal declined to release his tax returns but may in the future. The ad also appears on a website PolitiFact Georgia found Friday, www.whatisdealhiding.com. It asks, ""Did his backroom deals as a Congressman break the law as has been charged? We have a right to know."" And it offers readers the chance to sign a petition.There are a couple of problems with this. ""What is he hiding?"" is insinuation. And the site treats accusations of ""backroom deals"" as fact.So is Barnes running a ""polite"" and ""civil"" campaign?All of Barnes' ads, even his most aggressive one, ""Hiding,"" raise legitimate issues such as ethics accusations against Deal. For the most part, they portray those issues accurately.But as time has passed, the imagery and language show Barnes' campaign has changed in tone. Consider the slide whistle and the cutout of Deal's head and the ""backroom deals"" accusation. Our experts agreed that ""The Newspaper Says"" isn't negative. ""Newspapers Deal"" might be considered negative by Deal's camp, but it stuck to legitimate issues.""Hiding,"" however, is different. ""That is verging on what I think most people would be calling a negative ad,"" Lau said.Barnes' ads are not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff, but with each new TV commercial he has moved further from ""civil and polite"" territory. We give Barnes a Half Flip.Featured Fact-checkNathan Dealstated on July 30, 2010 in a press releaseRepublican candidate for governor ""Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign.""By Willoughby Mariano • August 4, 2010","https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2010/aug/17/roy-barnes/barnes-said-he-ran-positive-tv-campaign-primary/,/personalities/nathan-deal/,/factchecks/2010/aug/04/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-karen-handel-running-negative-cam/",,"Georgia,Message Machine 2010,Negative Campaigning,Roy Barnes",,,,,

Within 24 hours, two prominent Republicans asked that it be removed from the airwaves.It opens with a jail mugshot of Greer, and says (correctly) that Greer has been arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering in connection with his time as state GOP chairman.""And who backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities?"" a narrator asks. ""Bill McCollum.""""As investigators closed in, McCollum said Greer's financial records should be kept secret, not open to the public.""The narrator's statement comes with a typed-out McCollum quote from the Associated Press on Feb. 9, 2010. ""I don't think it's good for any party to have everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press,"" the ad quotes McCollum as saying.The ad then continues with Greer introducing McCollum on the day McCollum announced he was running for governor, and references a statement McCollum made in June 2010 that he didn't think the state should amend its public records laws so that all communications between state legislators would be public.The ad concludes with Greer's mugshot next to a picture of McCollum framed to look like a jail mugshot. ""Bill McCollum: He wants to keep it all a secret.""The 30-second spot, which is part of Scott's closing argument in a tight primary for governor, was quickly excoriated by current RPOF chairman John Thrasher and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Both called the ad misleading and false, and asked that it be removed.""The truth is that Bill McCollum's leadership is part of what led to the removal of Jim Greer,"" Barbour said in a statement. ""This ad distorts the facts and was clearly created without any knowledge of what actually took place. It has no place in this primary. We ask Mr. Scott to pull this ad and move forward in the primary in a constructive manner.""More specifically, Barbour and Thrasher say that the Scott ad wrongly suggests McCollum was complicit in a cover-up when in fact he helped lead the charge to have Greer removed and investigated. The Scott campaign defends the ad as true, and says it won't be pulled.PolitiFact Florida decided to sort out the difference of opinion by focusing on a pivotal line in the ad, that Bill McCollum ""backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities.""Sorting through the RPOF finances A little background is in order.The first allegations about improper spending at the state GOP came in late 2008, when newspapers reported that Greer charged personal expenses to the state party during a fundraiser. The $5,100 bill from the Breakers Hotel included using party money on spa treatments, seafood dinners and limousines. Greer said he would repay any personal expenses.Questions escalated in August 2009, after court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card. Charged expenses included taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The release of the records prompted some Republicans to criticize Greer, who as party chairman was responsible for party finances.Greer famously cut up a party American Express to help mollify critics. But soon thereafter, more party credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to even more questions about how the state GOP was spending its money and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, Greer succumbed to the pressure and resigned.When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances to identify any potential wrongdoing. The audit didn't focus on credit card spending as much as a contract with a consulting company, formed by Greer and Johnson, to do work for the RPOF. The company, Victory Strategies, was paid a 10 percent commission on money raised for the party. The audit revealed that the company received $133,005 in fundraising commissions and another $66,250 for consulting services in 2009.On March 15, Thrasher forwarded results of the audit to McCollum, who asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.On June 2, the FDLE announced Greer's arrest on one count of organized fraud, one count of money laundering and four counts of grand theft. According to the FDLE, Greer directed Johnson to open a bank account for Victory Strategies with Johnson as the only signatory on the account. This was done to conceal the flow of money to Greer. Between February and October 2009, the RPOF paid Victory Strategies a total of $199,254. Of that, Greer was paid $125,161 while keeping his ownership interest hidden. The FDLE said the payments were for many services that were never performed.PolitiFact Florida previously has ruled on claims related to the scandal. On May 3, we decided that McCollum had committed a Full-Flop on saying he supported transparency in dealing with the RPOF financial scandal. Then on July 13, we rated a claim by Thrasher that McCollum helped to work remove Greer as the head of the state party as True.McCollum's statementsIn this case, the Scott claim is that McCollum backed Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities.To us, that suggests McCollum was somehow complicit in Greer's scheme. There is no evidence of that, however.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on February 9, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows Tampa Mayor Jane Castor maskless at Super Bowl.By Ciara O'Rourke • February 10, 2021Rather, the Scott campaign says it's alleging that McCollum attempted to keep the scheme quiet.According to party leaders and McCollum, the attorney general first learned about the Victory Strategies contract in January, weeks before it was revealed in the media. McCollum said that when he learned about the contract, he asked another party activist attorney if it was legal. He was told yes. (McCollum said he didn't initially know Greer was a beneficiary of the contract).""It was on the face of it a perfectly legitimate contract,"" McCollum said in a interview on Feb. 9. ""Was it outrageous? Absolutely. Was it something that should have never been entered into? Yes.""That same day, Feb. 9, reporters paraphrased McCollum as saying that internal party business didn't need to be made public and that releasing credit card statements for past card holders was a decision that should be left to the next chairman.McCollum then provided the quote captured in Scott's ad. ""Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don't think it's good for any political party to be having everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press. On the other hand I think it's very important for the party regulars … (to) all have a clear and confident understanding of what's been going on in terms of everything, credit cards and bank accounts, everything else. I think that's what's been missing, and I think that's what the next chairman will correct.""Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell from the quote if McCollum was talking specifically about credit card statements, or about the Victory Strategies contract, or both.Two days later in a campaign statement McCollum clarified his position. He said the Republican Party should conduct a private audit of its finances before he would ask for a public state investigation. ""I share the outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending,"" McCollum said. ""If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the State Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency. The old way of doing business at the Republican Party of Florida enabled an egregious and unforgivable violation of trust between Party leadership and our membership. Now it is time to clean up the mess. I support taking every measure possible to ensure we never again face the challenges before us today.""And on Feb. 20, after Thrasher was elected chairman, McCollum called for a full internal forensic audit (as he said he would on Feb. 11), and urged that the results be released publicly (which he didn't say in the statement on the 11th). If any potential illegal activity surfaced during the audit, he said, it should be turned over to law enforcement. ""Credit cards should be a part of that. Everything should be,"" McCollum said.McCollum's statements strike us as a man attempting to shield the Republican Party from bad PR, not someone attempting cover-up potential fraud. In the end, it appears he got bad legal advice from a former party lawyer. Yet, his comments starting on Feb. 11 were clear -- if wrongdoing is found by the party, it will be turned over to the authorities. A month later, McCollum did just that when he presented the RPOF audit findings to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.That also counters Scott's suggestion that McCollum and Greer were somehow holed up at their Tallahassee version of the Alamo surrounded by state investigators. It was McCollum who referred the matter to investigators. And as we've previously ruled, McCollum helped pressure Greer to resign.Our rulingYou can argue that McCollum should have pressed for more transparency in handling the matter, and some have. And you can argue that McCollum was too slow to react to concerns over party spending, and some have. You can also argue that McCollum was too easily satisfied by the legal opinion of one person.But that is not what is being alleged in the Scott ad.It says that McCollum ""backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities."" There's no evidence that we find or that the Scott campaign provided that McCollum had any knowledge of Greer's Victory Strategies contract, or any evidence that McCollum attempted to stop a criminal investigation once an RPOF audit revealed potential fraud.We rate Scott's claim False.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgrlSkZJ6e8&feature=player_embedded,http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2010/06/greer_charged_w.php,http://www.nationalreview.com/battle10/244041/rick-scott-versus-republican-governors-association-kyle-o-peterson,http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/home/news/press-releases/2010/08/18/scott-campaign-statement-on-dc-insiders-rallying-to-mccollums-defense-to-preserve-the-status-quo/,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/03/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-transparency-rpof-credit-card/,https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/13/john-thrasher/john-thrasher-takes-credit-pushing-jim-greer-rpof/,/personalities/viral-image/,/factchecks/2021/feb/10/viral-image/photo-shows-tampa-mayor-maskless-september-not-sup/,http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2010/02/mccollum-not-interested-in-fdle-investigation-of-rpof.html",,"Ethics,Message Machine 2010,Transparency,Florida,Rick Scott",,,,,

""The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."" Maddow then showed a graph of apprehension rates of illegal immigrants from 1978 to 2008 that showed that the rate in 2008 was the lowest in years.We were curious to see if Maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse.The graph that Maddow displayed on the show was from a fact sheet published by the Department of Homeland Security. The graph displays border apprehensions by year. There is no way to know exactly how many people illegally cross the U.S. border every year, but ""apprehensions seem to be an indicator of inflows of undocumented Mexicans"" crossing the border illegally, according to Jeff Passel, a senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center.According to the DHS fact sheet, ""the number of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol declined for the third year in a row to 724,000 in 2008 after reaching a mid-decade peak of 1,189,000 in 2005.""However, some immigration experts do not consider apprehension rates to be particularly useful. Although the apprehension rate is usually a good indicator of trends, it is not exact, according to Bryan Griffith, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of increased border enforcement. ""Just because the apprehension rate is down, doesn't mean less people are trying to come. It could mean they're getting better"" at not getting caught.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Maddow decided to use apprehension statistics to make her point about illegal immigration. However, illegal immigration is about more than illegal border crossings. ""Focusing on the number of people crossing the border alone is just inaccurate,"" said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Apprehension rates are useful, ""but don't tell you the whole story."" For instance, it is estimated that as many as 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. entered legally, but overstayed their visas.The whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the United States. Using monthly Census data, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that ""the illegal population declined 13.7 percent (1.7 million) from a peak of 12.5 million in the summer of 2007 to 10.8 million in the first quarter of 2009."" This is similar to DHS estimates, which also saw a downward trend from a peak of 11.8 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009.Even though Maddow didn't use those statistics, they back up her claim. Illegal immigration is not increasing, and by at least two measurements, illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better. But don't herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet.It's important to note that the decline in the number of undocumented workers sneaking across the border may have less to do with a more secure border and more to do with a less secure economy in the U.S. The DHS report speculates that the decrease in inflow may be due to ""declining U.S. economic growth and enhanced border enforcement efforts.""Passel thinks it has more to do with the former than the latter. ""It's not that we're discouraging people,"" said Passel, ""It's because they know they can't get jobs because of the economic downturn."" Passel said that his data shows that ""from 1992 through about 2004 the U.S. employment rate and the volume of the numbers of Mexicans coming to the U.S. are almost perfectly correlated."" This seems to indicate that illegal immigration inflows are primarily related to economic considerations.""It's both economic and enforcement,"" said Griffith.""The more difficult you make the trip, the less people are going to attempt to make that trip.""However, if the unemployment rate drops and more jobs are available, it's likely that more people will risk crossing the border, because the benefits are worth the risk, according Carafano. The test is whether the illegal immigrant population will continue to decline after the economy picks up.By two key measurements, the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border are not increasing. At least for the time being, the numbers in both counts are going down. But when the economy picks up again, it is possible that illegal immigration will once again increase.  Nevertheless, looking at the numbers, we rate Maddow's statement True.","/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/",,"Immigration,National,Pundits,Rachel Maddow",,,,,

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took up the debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 1, 2010, arguing that the U.S. should seek immigrants with valuable work skills.""You have to give visas for the skills we need,"" Bloomberg said. ""Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs. We set aside 6 percent. We educate the doctors and then don't give them a green card.""Since we don't often hear about Canada's immigration policies, we decided to dig in and see if he was right.But before we get into the numbers, we should point out some important differences between immigration policies in the United States and Canada.The U.S. gives highest priority to family members of citizens and immigrants with work permits (which are often known as green cards) under the philosophy that immigrants with family members in the U.S. are more easily integrated into American society. Over two-thirds of all immigrants enter the U.S. through family reunification. Humanitarian protection and employment-based immigration account for the other third of legal immigration.Canada's system, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Although it permits immigration through family reunification and humanitarian protection channels, it primarily relies on a point system to determine who will be permitted through economic channels.The point system is designed to encourage immigration by those who seem likely to make the greatest contribution to the Canadian economy. The system awards points based on criteria such as level of education, languages spoken, occupation and whether or not the immigrant has relatives in Canada. Only candidates with enough points can apply for a Canadian work visa.So at the outset, the two systems were set up for very different purposes -- and encourage very different types of immigration. With that in mind, let's dig into the figures.There is no limit to the number of people who can immigrate to the U.S. through the family reunification process, as long as the immigrant's application is sponsored by a citizen. Employment-based immigration, on the other hand, is capped at 140,000 per year. Because employment-sponsored immigrants can also immigrate with spouses and children, only about 40 percent of those 140,000 visas go to workers themselves; the other 60 percent go to dependents.In the U.S., annual limits and caps on specific types of immigration were established in the 1990 Immigration Act, but there is no overall number limiting total immigration into the U.S. each year. Because there's no total cap on the number of visas available, it's impossible to say that 6 percent of visas are ""set aside."" There is no U.S. law that sets aside 6 percent of the annual flow of immigrants for skilled workers; rather, Department of Homeland Security data shows that most years about 6 percent of U.S. immigrants are sponsored by U.S. employers.Bloomberg's office told us the numbers come from a book published by the Brookings Institution that said 6.5 percent of immigrants came on employment visas. But we find that Bloomberg misspoke when he said that 6 percent of visas are set aside. While there is a cap on visas for economic immigrants or skilled workers, the cap is not a percentage.Canada, by contrast, does not cap job-related immigration. Instead, it sets annual ""targets,"" which are given as a range. In 2009, for example, the government hoped that between 156,300 and 166,800 skilled workers would become Canadian permanent residents. Bloomberg's assertion that any Canadian visas are ""set aside"" is incorrect.When we crunched the actual data from 2009 (not the limits or targets), we found that 63,997 Canadian immigrants came as principle workers and accounted for 25.4 percent of the total 252,124 who became Canadian permanent residents in 2009, well below the 36 percent Bloomberg cited.Bloomberg's figure for Canada may have come from a single category of economic immigrants, ""Skilled Workers,"" which, if dependents are included, accounted for 38 percent of all immigrants. If it did, he was comparing a small subsection of Canadian economic immigrants, including dependents, and the entire category of U.S. economic immigrants, not including dependents. That, in our view, is an apples to oranges comparison.So let's recap. While Bloomberg correctly noted an interesting disparity between Canadian and U.S. immigration policies, his facts are off. First, he says that the U.S. and Canada both set aside certain percentages of their visas. But only the U.S. limits visas for specific types of immigrants, and it does so with a number, not a percentage as he claims. And there is no ""set aside"" as Bloomberg says. We find the statement False.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

Take U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek's second ad in his Democratic U.S. Senate primary against rival Jeff Greene.The 30-second ad is called, ""Can Buy Anything,""  and focuses on how Greene made money using a complicated financial instrument called credit default swaps. We've written a lot about credit default swaps --  an investment that paid Greene hundreds of millions of dollars when other people's mortgages went bust, or their properties fell into foreclosure -- read here, here and here for a primer. But that's not what we noticed.What caught our eye were the images that filled the screen when a narrator uttered this line, ""Jeff Greene can buy anything, except the truth.""The images included a picture of Greene from one of his ads, a picture of him on a yacht and a picture of two houses. One is labeled ""Mansion."" The other is ""Mansion 2.""Greene is worth a small fortune -- a required federal disclosure lists his assets as ranging in value between $827 million and $2.8 billion. So we're not surprised the man would own two large homes.But we wanted to see if the Meek campaign had done its homework and produced real pictures of the homes. Or if the pictures were generic images of palacial digs.A bit of Internet searching reveals the answer.We first checked the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser to see about property Greene owns in his hometown. According to records, Greene dropped $24 million on a waterfront home in December 2009. We're not going to list the address here, but using the address, we were able to find the original for-sale listing.The nine bedroom, nine bathroom home was listed through The Corcoran Group. From the listing:Mizner's Coconut Hill - 234' Direct Oceanfront - Beautifully sited on 3.8 +/- acres, this unique compound boasts a long winding entry and limitless ocean vistas. Offering total privacy and approximately 12,000 square feet of well scaled living spaces, its original finishes remain: limestone, pecky cypress, stone/hardwood floors, french Palladian doors and more. Gracious outdoor terraces & an elegant oversized swimming pool complete this spectacular property that awaits a restoration and potential expansion.The listing included this photo gallery. Sure enough, the home is indeed what's called ""Mansion"" in Meek's campaign ad.As for ""Mansion 2,"" the property isn't in Florida at all, but rather California. It's a 25-acre estate in Beverly Hills he calls Palazzo di Amore.And it's Greene's.He used to live there but now is renting out the 43,000-square-foot home for $25,000 a month. (The home is still on the market, according to a Realtor's website, if you're interested).

Six acres of vineyards produce 400 cases of wine annually.The Journal article includes what appears to be the same image that is in Meek's ad.For the record, Realtors define a mansion as a home bigger than 8,000 square feet -- meaning both Greene properties qualify.And if you were wondering, the picture of Greene on the yacht is legit, too. It's ripped from a Forbes profile. The Forbes caption reads, ""Los Angeles real estate mogul Jeff Greene aboard his 145-foot yacht, Summerwind, docket at the Sag Harbor wharf of New York's tony Hamptons."" That's the same yacht that tore up a coral reef in Belize, by the way.In Kendrick Meek's second TV ad, he uses pictures of two homes and labels them ""Mansion"" and ""Mansion 2"" to help illustrate rival Jeff Greene's personal fortune.

578,,,,half-true,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jul/27/jeanne-shaheen/lawmaker-claims-unemployment-benefits-boost-econom/,"""For every dollar we put in unemployment, it pays back about $1.60.""",,politifact,,"Extending aid to the unemployed is not only the ""right"" thing to do, it is also one of the best ways to stimulate economic growth. That, at least, is what has become a frequent talking point, especially among Democratic lawmakers.New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen reiterated the argument during a recent MSNBC interview. ""This is one of the best things we can do to help stimulate the economy, because for every dollar we put in unemployment, it pays back about $1.60. And we know that people who are on unemployment are going to go out, and they're going to spend that money, they're going to pay for groceries at their local grocery store, they're going to buy gas in their car.""Using a dollar to make $1.60 sounds like a dream come true, so we decided to look into it.Shaheen's office told us that the number comes from Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Economy.com and a former adviser to John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign.During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on April 14, 2010, Zandi called on lawmakers to provide emergency benefits to individuals who have lost their jobs. ""No form of the fiscal stimulus has proved more effective during the past two years than emergency UI benefits,"" Zandi said, using the abbreviation for unemployment insurance. Specifically, he calculated that for every dollar spent in benefits, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grows by $1.61 one year later.Next, we looked at a report issued in January 2010 by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official nonpartisan number-cruncher for Congress. In its discussion of increasing unemployment aid, the report noted that the proposal is ""both timely and cost-effective in spurring economic activity and employment."" For every dollar spent, the CBO wrote, the GDP would increase by anywhere from $0.70 to $1.90 per year from 2010 to 2015.What accounts for such a large variation? Till von Wachter, an associate professof of economics at Columbia University, told us that this sort of a range ""is typical in this kind of empirical analysis."" He said that one possible reason is ""because different estimation methods or specifications give slightly different results."" David Card from the University of California-Berkeley added that the uncertainty ""presumably illustrates the sad state of knowledge in the field.""So, Shaheen is right on target if we go by Zandi's numbers, but she picked a number that's in the upper range of CBO's estimated range. Still, there is more to the story.For one, there is considerable question among academics about the accuracy of the unemployment benefits' ""multiplier effects."" Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, pointed out that before spending on unemployment benefits goes up, the GDP goes down, which makes it difficult to come up with a ""serious estimate"" of the impact of unemployment benefits. Lawrence Katz, also from Harvard, said that he has ""many qualms with these standard macro forecasting models."" Still, Katz also pointed out that the current models are ""the best we have right now to make such forecasts."" Alan Reynolds, an economist from the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, wrote in a January 29, 2010 blog post that Zandi's econometric model relies on assumptions that are contradicted by contemporary academic research. There are also some researchers who maintain that not only does increased spending on unemployment provides minimal economic boost, but also that it may decrease output in the long run, in part because the government will have to recoup money paid out in benefits through increased taxes. In a November 2008 report, scholars Karen Campbell and James Sherk from the conservative Heritage Foundation argue that existing studies on the subject are flawed, because they do not take into account that unemployment insurance reduces workers' incentives to work. The pro-benefits studies also assume that every dollar of spending funds new consumption, they said. Many studies since the 1970s ""have concluded that unemployment insurance plays at best a small role in stabilizing the economy,"" the report argued. Campbell added, however, that though she does not believe that economic stimulus is a good argument for extending benefits, welfare arguments could be made for doing so.To recap: Sen. Shaheen said that ""for every dollar we put in unemployment it, pays back about $1.60."" The CBO said that the increase is actually anywhere from $.70 to $1.90, so she picked a number that's on the high end of that estimate. She's right on target if we go by Mark Zandi's economic study, but many of the scholars we spoke with are critical of attempts to accurately estimate the effect that spending on unemployment insurance has on the GDP.

Reid, the Senate's most powerful member, faces Republican Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite.In mid-July, American Crossroads -- a group that's the brainchild of top Republican officials including Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie, both former strategists for President George W. Bush -- released one of the latest in a string of hard-hitting ads in the race.The ad said, ""It's bad enough that Nevada has the highest unemployment in the nation. And Harry Reid claims to be helping the jobs situation. Really Harry? Recent data showed Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from Harry's stimulus bill. Thats right. Senate Leader Harry Reid has gotten his own state less help than every other state but one. Along with bailouts, deficits and Obama care, that's what Harry Reid's done for Nevada. Really, Harry? That's not the kind of help Nevada needs.""We thought it would be worth checking to see whether Nevada really ranks 50th in aid from President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill.Tracking down the source of the claim was easy: The ad includes an on-air citation of a Las Vegas Review-Journal story. But we sat bolt upright when we saw the story's date: Feb. 23, 2009. No, not Feb. 23, 2010. The ad said Feb. 23, 2009. That's less than two weeks after Congress passed the massive bill -- not exactly ""recent"" in our view. Seeking more details, we looked at the story itself. It's a comprehensive article by staff reporter Molly Ball that outlined how Nevada ranked in per capita stimulus aid overall (50th of 51, counting the District of Columbia), as well as for education (51st), transportation (48th), and Medicaid assistance (47th).Because we couldn't find any official document on the Internet that confirmed Nevada's 50th-place rating, we contacted Ball. She said that she calculated the numbers herself using data provided to her at the time. The article cites numerous sources, including the Nevada State Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, the journalistic outfit ProPublica, the Democratic Policy Committee and CNNMoney.com. It also explains that a large part of the reason why Nevada was poised to receive comparatively little funding was that federal dollars from the stimulus are pegged in part to what the state already pays for programs such as Medicaid, which are low compared to many other states.The rankings attracted attention at the time. A March 1, 2009, column in the Review-Journal's competitor, the Las Vegas Sun, picked up on the raw-deal-on-the-stimulus theme and quoted a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons saying, ""The governor was surprised and a little disappointed we didn’t receive more in the stimulus package for the state.""So we can understand why American Crossroads used these figures. But was it appropriate to describe them as ""recent""? We don't think so.The Obama Administration has made significant efforts to collect and publicize data on where stimulus dollars are going through the website Recovery.gov, run by a congressionally created board independent of the administration. (The Recovery Board collects the data from recipients via FederalReporting.gov,) So we turned to Recovery.gov for the most up-to-date data.There's a state-by-state breakdown that lists ""funds available,"" which is defined as ""funds set aside for release to a recipient either immediately or in the future."" Through July 15, 2010 -- 17 months more recent than the article cited in the ad -- almost $3.2 billion had been set aside for Nevada, about double the amount calculated by the Review-Journal in early 2009. To make an apples-to-apples comparison to the figure cited in the ad, we calculated stimulus funds per capita, by dividing every state's dollar total by its population. Using this measurement, Nevada actually ranked almost exactly in the middle of all states -- 26th from the top.There's also a breakdown for ""funds paid out"" to date. Using this measurement, Nevada has received $2.2 billion, which is even better -- Nevada ranks 16th highest nationally, or well above average.When we asked American Crossroads for comment, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said that it's legitimate to fault Reid based on the original Review-Journal statistics, which reflected the bill immediately after it left his chamber. ""When the Senate Majority leader brags about all the power and the prestige he brings Nevada, while not actually getting anything for Nevada in the stimulus bill he controlled, he has neglected his home state,"" Collegio said.We'll grant that there are a lot of different ways to make this kind of calculation. An ongoing study by ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet that has tracked stimulus data, found that Nevada ranks 9th from the bottom, using data that is several months older (and possibly different from) than what is found on recovery.gov. Even recovery.gov offers various types of data that can be sliced and diced to produce state rankings. So the authors of the ad had no shortage of data to choose from.It's not surprising that American Crossroads would reach for the most unflattering number, and if they'd framed it carefully -- for instance, saying that the state ranked 50th ""in one study"" -- they would have scored passably on our Truth-O-Meter. However, American Crossroads not only cherry-picked the most damning data but also tried to pass it off as ""recent."" Current data would have showed that Nevada's stimulus haul was no smaller than about average by national standards. This is not a trivial omission, so we rate the ad False.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

He unveiled a spending plan that calls for making President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ending the inheritance tax and nixing a value-added tax. And, in one of his most reliable lines, Rubio links the federal budget to his offspring's economic future.""Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children,"" he told Fox News on June 28, 2010. ""I think that's outrageous. We have to stop doing that.""Rubio repeated the claim at an event just outside of St. Petersburg on July 13: ""Forty cents of every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed from my children's and your children's and grandchildren's generation. No Americans before have ever done that — not at this perverse level, not at this sustained rate.""Given that Rubio's budget beef has become the heart of his Tea Party-esque stump speech, we wondered whether the father of four was using hard numbers or pushing some kind of GOP fairy tale.The Rubio campaign directed us to an Associated Press article published in the New York Times on Feb. 4, 2010: ""The House voted Thursday to allow the government to go $1.9 trillion deeper in debt, an increase of about $6,000 for every United States resident. The accumulated debt already amounts to roughly $40,000 per person.

""It's solid, basic math. It just calculates the deficit as a percentage of total spending.""Everyone we spoke with said the deficit will eventually need to be trimmed -- and soon. But, Rubio's larger point -- that the deficit is bad policy -- was largely debated.""The reason the deficit is so big right now is because we have a massive economic meltdown and deficit spending is appropriate,"" said Elliott Parker, a University of Nevada Reno economics professorParker opposes Rubio's spending plan.""This is politics at its silliest,"" Parker said. ""You cannot simultaneously make Bush’s tax cuts permanent and deal with the federal deficit, unless you are willing to severely cut Social Security and Medicare.""Leonard Burman, a Syracuse University public affairs professor and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Department of the Treasury, also cautioned against using current deficit figures as a rallying call.The White House's budget predicts the deficit will fall to 33 percent in 2011, 22 percent in 2012 and 17 percent by 2015 under current policy.However, Burman, like Rubio, expressed concern that Obama has not taken more forceful actions to decrease the deficit. One of Obama's high-profile solutions was to form a debt commission, which is due to make recommendations to Congress by December.""I hope the commission is successful, but I also hope to see the Tooth Fairy some day,"" Burman deadpanned.In short, we can't predict whether the Rubio children will be stuck with our tab.

Roy Barnes says. And that means corporations are reluctant to relocate here and give you jobs.   It's because your state Legislature has done some wacky things, according to the Democrat's latest campaign commercial, ""Travel for Jobs."" In this bid to win his old job back, Barnes took us on a trip down memory lane to recall some of the Legislature's stranger moments.   ""[I]t's hard for industry to take us seriously when the Legislature attempts to outlaw stem cell research, passes bills about microchips in the brain and talks about seceding from the union,"" an announcer said in the ad.   Wait. Microchips? In the brain?   And secession? Recently?  The Barnes campaign sent us information on all three legislative attempts. All passed the Senate, then withered in the House.   On stem cell research:  The campaign cited 2009's Senate Bill 169, the Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act, sponsored by state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull.  Typically, when people discuss the stem cell research controversy, they're talking about ""embryonic"" stem cell research, which can destroy the embryo. This poses ethical problems for people who regard a human embryo as a human life.   The legislation stated that the creation of all embryos ""shall be solely for the purposes of initiating a human pregnancy."" This means it would have barred scientists from creating human embryos for research.  The bill does not ban embryonic stem cell research involving already-existing stem cell lines or lines from out of state. This was by design, Hudgens told PolitiFact Georgia.   It passed the state Senate March 12, 2009.  So state legislators did try to ""outlaw"" an important element of embryonic stem cell research, but not all of it.   On microchips in the brain:   Barnes cited SB 235, the Microchip Consent Act of 2010, sponsored by state Sen. Chip Pearson, a Republican from Dawsonville. It would have made it a misdemeanor to require a person to be implanted with the device beneath or in the skin. This includes the brain.   Proponents had no evidence of large-scale abuses of the technology.   ""This is proactive,"" state Rep. Ed Setzler, who pushed the bill in the House, said at the time. It passed the Senate on Feb. 4.   Therefore, while the state Senate did not pass ""bills"" on ""microchips in the brain,"" it did pass one of them. And that one only cleared one chamber of the Legislature.  On seceding from the Union:  The Barnes camp pointed PolitiFact Georgia to Senate Resolution 632, which was also sponsored by Pearson. He could not be reached to clarify the bill's intent, so we analyzed the language ourselves and read an op-ed he wrote that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   The six-page resolution does not specifically mention ""secession,"" but it does lay out how and when states would do it. If the federal government creates laws that states think overstep its constitutional authority, they can ""nullify"" those laws, or declare them void.   Here's where the possibility of secession comes into play. The bill lists six types of laws that, if enacted, would prompt the dissolution of the United States. Some, such as the declaration of martial law, are remote possibilities. Others are not, such as laws that limit the right to bear arms, ""including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition.""  If such laws are passed, the federal government's powers would revert to the states, according to the resolution. States that want to form a new United States can do so. The rest can go off on their own.   The resolution passed the state Senate April 1, 2009.   In Pearson's op-ed, he disagreed with critics who said that the bill ""will likely lead Georgia to secede from and disband the United States."" It is an ""extreme view"" and ""loose interpretation of the measure's language.""   That may be true, but whether the bill makes secession ""likely"" is a separate issue. The bill opens the door to it. Or as Barnes' commercial said, it ""talks about seceding from the Union.""   We find that Barnes' ad is not entirely correct but does say many accurate things.   Georgia's state Senate did try to outlaw types of embryonic stem cell research, though not all of it, as the ad suggests. It passed a law -- not ""laws"" -- on ""microchips in the brain."" And while a bill didn't use the word ""secession,"" it raised the possibility and outlined what would trigger it.

Barton pointed us to a Web post by Cohen’s campaign inviting visitors to a 90-minute “Appropriations Forum” on May 6 featuring Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, on which Cohen sits.Cohen writes in the Pitts-related post: “I respect Chairman Pitts’ leadership and value his insights as we are face critical days of current cuts and budget shortfalls. I appreciate his willingness to travel to Houston and be a part of this forum.”Pitts told us he might have erred by agreeing to speak at the forum in an election year. “I didn’t go there to help Ellen, that wasn’t the purpose. But I learned my lesson. I am going to be very careful. My timing probably should be before a primary, or even before people file” their candidacies in December and early January before the primaries.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Pitts said Davis’s husband approached him after he spoke to question his remark that “Ellen and I have our hands full next session”-- implying Pitts expects Cohen to win re-election. “I did say that; I guess I’m guilty,” Pitts said.Kent Adams, the GOP nominee’s husband, later told us he took note of Cohen campaign signs outside the Pitts’ engagement and campaign literature at the Branch event.Tammi Wallace, Cohen’s chief of staff, said the signs were put up so audience members could find their way in.Adams said Cohen campaign workers and campaign literature were at both events. Wallace said there was no literature as such, though campaign-funded constituent survey cards were put out and Cohen campaign staff members attended the forums “because the campaign staff is expected to pitch in and do whatever they need to do to help out.”Would Pitts accept invitations to speak at forums hosted by Democratic House incumbents facing Republican challengers this November? “I would pass,” Pitts said. “I don’t want to send the wrong signal. I would go any place (to speak) but I don’t want to do it with a Democrat and I’m not going to do it for any Republican against an incumbent Democrat.”His rationale: He’ll need the support of members of both parties to advance the next state budget. “We’ve got to pass a bill,” Pitts said.Are Branch and Pitts “helping” Cohen against her GOP opponent by speaking to her constituents, as Barton claims? Adams, Davis’s husband/campaign manager, said that Cohen obviously intended for the GOP speakers to boost her campaign, but few people turned out for Branch, he said, and tax talk at Pitts’ stop was off-putting. “They were inconsequential,” he said.For her part, Cohen characterized the appearances by Pitts and Branch as informational instead of political. “The story to me is the fact that two Republican chairs of committees I serve on willingly agreed to come in and educate my district,” she said.What we find: Barton’s statement accurately refers to the GOP House members appearing at events with Cohen at her invitation, in her district. But the two forums weren’t political rallies--and even her opponent’s campaign manager saw no boon for Cohen.We rate Barton’s statement Half True.","/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Bipartisanship,Texas,David Barton",,,,,

Gregory added that ""we know the federal government's not equipped to stop the, the spill or plug the leak. You've got to have that level of expertise. But it does seem, and Thad Allen even referred to that in The Wall Street Journal this week, as if there is a learning curve because nobody's got the experience to deal with a large-scale spill like this.""""We're all on a learning curve,'' Landrieu responded. ""I learned this week that Canada ... for instance, does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States. Maybe we should think about that."" She added that ""this is like going through something where we've never had a fire drill.""We were curious about the two related claims: Whether Canada does such practice sessions in open water, and whether the United States does not.Canada does practice controlled oil spills in the open water. In a congressional hearing featuring Kevin Costner, the woman sitting to his left, Dr. Nancy Kinner, the co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, mentioned that both Canada and Norway have controlled oil spills so that they can test new technologies.Featured Fact-checkStudents for Trumpstated on February 16, 2021 in a Tweet“Joe Biden is handing our power grid to the Chinese Communist Party.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 23, 2021The United States does not share that capability with their neighbor to the north, according to Kinner. ""The United States is the only country that does oil spill R&D that has no opportunity to actually have on-water controlled spills to test technology,"" Kinner told members of Congress. The Minerals Management Service confirms that ""the U.S. prohibits training with real oil in the open ocean or conducting testing of equipment, technologies or methodologies with real oil in the open ocean. In North America testing, training and research using real oil is conducted in test tanks and in laboratories.""According to the Evironmental Protection Agency, it is technically possible to obtain a permit to spill oil on the open ocean through the EPA, but that type of permit has not been granted for at least 20 years. As of now, the main training capability inside the U.S. is the National Oil Spill Response Research & Renewable Energy Test Facility, also known as Ohmsett. Real oil is used inside the training facility, but that is an enclosed system. The advantages of the Ohmsett system include the ability to control for all variables, allowing participants to test in a variety of different conditions. However, many experts, including Kinner, believes there is value to testing in the real world. ""I think we need to open up that possibility,'' she said, ""that we have small releases where we can have open water testing, outside of Ohmsett, to test the in real world conditions, instead of in a big test tank."" The U.S. does have the Ohmsett's testing facility, and MMS has participated in the open-water exercises in Canada and Norway, so Landrieu overstates the situation when she says it is the equivalent to never having a fire drill. Landrieu is right when she says that Canada practices in open water for oil spills, and that such testing is de facto prohibited here because the EPA has not issued a permit in two decades. Still, the application process does exist. It remains legally possible to ask for permission.

Among them are retirees, a powerful voting bloc, which means Democrats who pushed for the reform have some explaining to do. How do they convince them that they have their best interests in mind? Enter Georgia's Democratic Party, whose chair Jane Kidd wrote a column to address these concerns. That opinion piece was e-mailed to the press. Thanks to health care reform, the op-ed said, seniors will get free services that can help keep them healthy. She wrote: ""For example, while seniors today must pay for preventative care, health reform eliminates co-pays, deductibles, and other costs for preventative care and provides for free annual wellness checkups starting next year – ensuring that every Georgia senior has the care they need to better maintain their health.""Free? Is this too good to be true? To back up their claim, Georgia's Democrats referred us to an article in The Record newspaper of Troy, N.Y., that cited the AARP. It states that ""many preventative services . . . will now be free for Medicare beneficiaries, and they won’t have to shell out co-pays for those services."" They also sent an article from CNN.com that said, ""Medicare will provide free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011,"" and a fact sheet from WhiteHouse.gov that said the same thing. We called the AARP, a group known for its extensive research on issues that affect seniors. They confirmed that seniors who have Medicare will receive annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011.These benefits were established by Title IV of the massive health care overhaul bill, dubbed ""Prevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public Health."" By 2010, Medicare recipients will receive free ""annual wellness visits"" from their health care providers. The checkup will include the creation of a personal prevention plan and a schedule of recommended health screenings for the next five to 10 years, the bill states. Since the AARP took sides on the issue, we sought additional verification. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that administers these programs, confirmed the AARP account and gave some additional information. There is some question about whether members of Medicare Advantage plans -- the privately managed plans that operate under the Medicare umbrella -- will also receive these wellness visits for free. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said federal law requires that Medicare Advantage plans provide, at a minimum, the services included in Medicare. So by 2011, these plans will also have to provide wellness visits without charge. Generally speaking, the health care law has several provisions that attempt to change Medicare so that it pays for good outcomes instead of paying per procedure, a system known as ""fee for service."" The free preventive care is part of that overall philosophy.Tests such as cancer screenings that are already free under Medicare will remain so, and additional tests may also be included, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. Still, we at PolitiFact Georgia remained dubious. Is there no provision that will make seniors pay for the ""free"" preventive services in an indirect way?   Well there's free. And then there's ""free."" It's free if you paid your Medicare taxes, and make below a certain income. Over time, higher-income seniors will find that their overall Medicare costs increase, according to tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots, and a PolitiFact Georgia review of the legislation.Under the current system, recipients with individual incomes of $85,000 or family incomes of $170,000 pay higher premiums to receive coverage. Under the new system, the pool of people who pay this bigger bill will gradually increase because the income thresholds will not be adjusted for inflation until 2019,according to Section 3402 of the legislation. For those who cross the threshold, this could mean an increase of roughly $50 a month, Antos said. All taxpayers, including seniors, who make more than $200,000 individually or $250,000 as a family will pay more in payroll taxes under Section 9015 of the bill. Also, seniors who like to work on their tans -- whoever you are -- should watch out. Indoor tanning salons will have to pay an excise tax under the new law. That cost will likely be passed on to customers, Gleckman said. But the overwhelming majority of retired seniors will find that free preventive services are just that. Free.

Rick Perry vs. Washington again, this time in a battle over Texas' compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.A day after the state filed suit to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking over parts of the state program that issues permits for companies to foul the air, Perry touted afresh Texas' progress in reducing pollution levels.Since 2000, Perry said in a press release issued Tuesday, ""the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" The same statistic was cited by Perry in a May 28 letter to President Barack Obama and mentioned in news accounts such as a New York Times article published online June 9.Sounds good, but what do the figures mean? And does the state deserve credit for improvements?First, let's look at the basic science. A goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what EPA calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers.EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozonethe primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard.Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Perry's May letter to Obama focuses on ozone levels and nitrogen oxide emissions because ""ozone is the only thing that we are in nonattainment for the state. And NOx is a precursor to ozone, so it makes sense to highlight that.""Experts agreed with that reasoning. David Allen, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas, said: ""Controlling NOx emissions is, in general, the most effective strategy for reducing ozone in Texas. So, the governor was right to focus on NOx.""The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality provided us with data showing a 46 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide from industrial sources such as chemical plants, refineries and electric utility plants between 2000 and 2006. Considering the drop through 2008, the decrease was even bigger: 53 percent.However, industrial sources account for only about a fourth of NOx emissions in Texas. Most come from road vehicles, ships and airplanes, as well as smaller sources such as gas stations and dry cleaners. Susana Hildebrand, TCEQ's chief engineer, told us Perry referenced industrial sources of pollution because that's mainly what the state regulates; the federal government regulates mobile sources.Considering all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions, the total fell 26 percent between 2002 and 2008. (The reduction since 2000 was not available.)As for ozone itself, establishing that statewide measure is complicated. There are about 70 regulatory ozone monitors in Texas, primarily in urban areas, almost all located on or east of the Interstate 35 corridor. The statewide measure is the three-year average of ozone levels from sites with some of the highest readings. TCEQ said it believes the sites were all in Houston or Dallas.The data show a 22 percent reduction in ozone between 2000 and 2008.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021In short, said UT's Allen, Perry's ozone figure is in line with what the agency and university researchers have found. ""All of these measurements paint a consistent picture. Ozone concentrations are going down across the state,"" he said.Still, some parts of Texas have struggled to meet federal ozone standards. Three regions are currently designated in nonattainment under a limit set by EPA in 1997: Dallas-Forth Worth (nine counties), Houston (eight counties), and Beaumont-Port Arthur (four counties). According to TCEQ, the Beaumont area is being reclassified as in compliance and the Houston area met the standard for the first time in 2009.But a tightening of EPA standards, expected in August, will likely put several more areas, including the five-county Austin region, out of compliance.Next, to what degree were the reductions in ozone and NOx achieved by the state's ""clean-air program""?Allen said that it's difficult to say ""quantitatively"" whether federal or state regulations were primarily responsible. Indeed, we found disagreement among experts on that front.Hildebrand, of TCEQ, said state efforts deserve full credit for the industrial NOx emission reductions, pointing to initiatives designed to bring regions into compliance with federal ozone standards. An example: the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program, in place in Houston since 2001, which limits NOx emissions from large sources.But Neil Carman, clean air program director of the environmental group Sierra Club of Texas, said the federal government deserves the vast majority of the credit for reducing industrial NOx pollution because state actions have been driven by the Clean Air Act.And vehicle emissions, which are regulated by the feds and are a greater source of NOx pollution than industrial sources, have gone down as well -- 40 percent by TCEQ's measure between 2002 and 2008. Hildebrand acknowledged that has helped improve Texas' ozone picture.Al Armendariz of Dallas, administrator of EPA's multi-state Region 6, which includes Texas, credited all levels of government with hastening the ozone improvements, especially in Dallas and Houston. As examples, he pointed to enforcement actions taken against industry by the federal government that led to facilities' agreeing to major cuts in emissions, as well as state initiatives.The state touts incentive-driven programs such as its Emission Reduction Plan, which has spent more than $760 million since 2000 to help companies retrofit or replace more than 12,000 diesel vehicles with cleaner-burning ones.Despite the ozone improvements, a report released April 28 by the American Lung Association ranked the Houston area as the seventh-worst in the nation for ozone pollution and Dallas-Fort Worth 13th. (The worst six places for ozone were in California.) Of the 30 Texas counties graded by the lung association on their ozone pollution, 21 -- including Travis -- received F's.So how does Perry's statement hold up?The governor accurately cites recent improvements in the state's ozone levels. As for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic refers to only one source -- industrial -- which he did not note. Nearly three-quarters comes from other sources.Whether the state gets the credit for those improvements is another issue. Even if TCEQ is responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts -- namely vehicle emission regulations -- also have helped lower ozone levels. Significantly, the state's ozone-related programs exist to help Texas comply with federal expectations.We rate Perry's statement as Half True.","/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Environment,Texas,Rick Perry",,,,,

Lawton Chiles, announced his independent run for governor on June 3, 2010, by saying he'd be a voice for those who traditionally have been cut out of the democratic process.""I'm here to speak for 1 million Floridians who today are out of work, for almost 1 million children who have no health insurance in this state and for millions of Florida citizens like me, who believe that Florida can and must do better by its families and by its communities,"" Chiles said.Chiles, previously a registered Democrat, said he opted out of a Democratic primary with Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink after he spoke on the phone with Sink and she told him she plans to raise $30 million in the race. Sink denies using that figure.In this item, we wanted to check Chiles' claim that almost 1 million Florida children are without health insurance.The number is particularly surprising, given that the state operates a program called Florida KidCare, which provides free or heavily subsidized health insurance for many uninsured children under 19. To qualify for Florida KidCare you must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-U.S. Citizen (read the eligibility information here). The Florida Department of Health says that 1.8 million children are currently enrolled in the program.To begin to assess Chiles' figure we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy.In October 2009, they produced a report called ""The Uninsured, a Primer,"" which details the number of people insured and uninsured by race, gender, age and state.The report is based on Census information and averages 2007 and 2008 calculations to provide state-level data. Kaiser says the data comes with a margin of error between 5 and 7.9 percentage points.According to Kaiser, 18.3 percent of Florida's 4.3 million children under 19 are without health insurance, or about 787,000 children. Only Texas has a higher percentage of children uninsured, Kaiser found.Families USA, a national consumer health care group, said in an October 2008 study that 797,000 children in Florida were without health care (18.8 percent of all children). The study, like Kaiser's, relied on Census data and counted children under 19.Families USA found that over 60 percent of Florida’s uninsured children come from low-income families who likely are eligible for Florida KidCare.A third group, The Commonwealth Fund, found in a 2009 study that 18 percent of children 0-17 in Florida were without health insurance -- the highest percentage of children uninsured in the country. The Commonwealth Fund study did not attach a raw number like the Families USA and Kaiser surveys, but 18 percent is in the same range as the findings of the other two studies.In his announcement as a candidate for governor, Chiles said that almost 1 million children in Florida don't have health insurance. The most reliable and recent studies put the number at close to 800,000. Chiles uses the word ""almost,"" which gives him some leeway.

Whitman cleaned up the site. No more guns. No more fake paintings. But pornography? Whitman started a separate division that only sells porn. Under Whitman's leadership, the porn site became one of the largest on the Internet.""And in an especially creepy moment toward the end, the video shows a slouching teenage boy on a laptop computer. Enough said.The ad says Whitman is ""all about the money"" and accuses her of ""bad judgment"" and ""wrong values.""Web-only video ads are often among the edgiest attack weapons in modern campaigns. And this one is no different.It's true that eBay has an ""adult only"" section in which people sell pornographic magazines, videos, adult toys etc. But Whitman didn't introduce the idea to start selling adult material on eBay. People were already auctioning adult products on eBay when she came on board as the company's president and CEO in 1998. Rather, not long after taking over, Whitman created the ""adult only"" section essentially to wall it off from children.By way of research, we went onto eBay to check it out the adult section (we swear, this was new to us). The ""adult only"" section isn't listed among the favorite categories on the home page. Nor is it in the immediate drop down menu for categories. We found it by clicking on the ""everything else"" category at the bottom. In order to get in, you've got to sign in, attest to being an adult and provide credit card information. That doesn't sound completely child-proof, but there has been some effort to make it more difficult for kids to get there. And it's not prominently displayed or promoted on the home page.Nonetheless, the section has been successful.In a story under the headline ""Republican Meg Whitman's secret past as a porn-peddling CEO at eBay,"" SF Weekly said porn has been an eBay profit center -- ""albeit a relatively tiny, multimillion-dollar one in a company with annual revenues of more than $8 billion."" And, the story said, it appears to be a growing part of eBay's revenue stream.The SF Weekly story quoted Scott Newman, former eBay vice president of customer support, saying the Adult Only section posed a quandary for Whitman.""There was a lot of concern whether we should continue having a mature audiences site or not,"" he said. Whitman ""had often gone on the record saying, 'I wish we hadn't started that thing.' But it was kind of like, now it's out of the bag, and to stop it would have caused kind of a big deal, I guess, with the sellers who made their living on the 'mature' site.""Whitman apparently pushed for a policy to prohibit the use of PayPal to purchase material from the Adult Only section, but ultimately deferred to company directors who advised against such a ban. On March 27, 2009, Business Week published a Q & A between Whitman and Rajiv Dutta, who had previously served as president of eBay Marketplaces, PayPal and Skype.Dutta: ""Now, there was one call that you and I disagreed on. And the issue was: Should we enable Paypal for legal adult and gaming sites?"" Whitman: ""I said no.""Dutta: ""Right, that this was out of character for the company to do. And my comeback was that PayPal is a currency, and we cannot use it in some places and not in others. And so, we had this spirited debate, and you let me do what I wanted to do, which was enable PayPal."" Whitman: ""Yes."" Dutta: ""Why?"" Whitman: ""Well, that's a very good question. Why did I do that? No, I'm teasing. Companies are led by collections of individuals. I mean, yes, I was president and CEO of eBay, but you are only as good as the people you surround yourself with. Whether it's a nonprofit institution or a university, you're only as good as the people you surround yourself with. And I think if you want to get the very best people, you need to give them degrees of freedom, you need to give them latitude within a set of defined points of view, rules, if you will. And you need to let them figure it out. And PayPal was a separate division in eBay, which of course is a separate division from Skype. And this was a gray area.""Frederick S. Lane, author of the book Obscene Profits, a study of the business of pornography on the Internet, said he found the suggestion that Whitman was a porn peddler is ridiculous.""What Whitman did was carve out a separate section on eBay for adult content,"" Lane said. ""It was done to limit children's access. They perceived like everyone else that the real issue was not exposing children to this material, and the way to do that was to get people to register and indicate that they were adults."" Requiring credit card verification is one of the most reliable ways to ensure sites are being used by adults, he said. ""I'm uncomfortable characterizing her as the operator of an adult business,"" Lane said. ""I think that's ridiculous."" eEbay is essentially a huge flea market, he said, where independent contractors sell things.""It's not like they are producing or directing the production of content,"" Lane said of eBay. ""They don't produce or distribute anything.""Still, he said, ""it's legitimate to say she profited from these sales. But to suggest that she was running an adult business, that's not an accurate characterization.""For it's part, the Whitman campaign has dismissed Poizner's ad as ""desperate.""""Is Steve Poizner seriously trying to tell us that eBay is a pornography site?"" said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. ""eBay's millions of users, including my grandmother, will find that a little hard to believe.""So is Whitman just another version of (Hustler magazine publisher and onetime California gubernatorial candidate) Larry Flynt, as Poizneer's press secretary suggested recently?

However, we believe a reasonable person would interpret it to mean that a policy of continuing ""taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals"" would mean ""a skyrocketing cost"" due to the newly passed federal health care law.Whitman's press office did not respond to several inquiries from PolitiFact. The candidate's website does not directly address the question of whether she would continue ""taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals"" in the health care realm, though it does say that she advocates curbing state benefits for illegal immigrants in two other areas -- barring them from attending state-funded colleges and universities and preventing them from securing drivers' licenses.As for the question of whether the federal health care law will lead to skyrocketing costs, it would be incorrect to say that the new federal law is poised to increase California's costs directly. Written into the federal law is a clearly worded provision that prevents illegal immigrants from taking advantage of the law's benefits, such as the health care exchanges where uninsured Americans can compare plans and purchase coverage. But the Poizner campaign argues that the new law could have an indirect impact on California's deeply strained budget.The federal bill expands Medicaid eligibility to all Americans earning up to 133 percent of the poverty line. ""This will lead to more illegal immigrants enrolling, because California provides a version of Medicaid to illegal immigrants,"" Poizner's campaign press secretary, Bettina Inclán, told PolitiFact.But it's wrong to assume that illegal immigrants will qualify for full-blown Medicaid in California. In fact, the only entitlement they get from Medicaid is emergency care in hospitals, which is already mandatory under federal law and was not changed by the newly passed health care bill. These limited benefits are available to any illegal immigrant who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. (Illegal immigrants can also qualify for Medicaid benefits for long-term care, but it's not an entitlement -- coverage is provided only to the extent that legislators and the governor agree to fund the program, and there's no federal match.)Right now, emergency care for illegal immigrants in California is paid by the state and local government. To the extent that more illegal immigrants will now qualify for California's version of Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal) and use emergency hospital services, the only difference will be a shift of payment responsibility from one state or local account to another. (Whether the federal government will continue to pick up part of the cost for treating illegal immigrants using Medi-Cal -- as the federal government does today -- is unclear, given the new bill's language.)Take pregnancy care. There shouldn't be any new costs, because Medi-Cal already covers pregnant women up to 185 percent of the poverty line, which is more generous than the 133 percent in the federal law. As a result, undocumented immigrants who need emergency delivery would already have been on emergency Medicaid anyway.The Poizner campaign has a point that coverage of emergency care for illegal immigrants -- including pregnancy costs -- is not cheap, costing upwards of $800 million a year. And that amount seems destined to rise, judging by the recent history of inflation in the health care sector and perhaps an increase in the number of illegal immigrants residing in the state.So the state's burden for providing health care to illegal immigrants may go up, but it is not accurate for the Poizner campaign to blame that development either on the new federal health care law or on the Democratic president who pushed for it.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021The new federal law specifically prevents illegal immigrants from benefitting, and most of the additional indirect costs that might be expected from expanding the Medicaid rolls are already being paid in California by different state or local government accounts.

Beltway.""",,politifact,,"Shortly after President Barack Obama nominated Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of Republicans lined up to raise questions about her qualifications. Among the most common themes from Republicans was that Kagan has the resume of a legal elitist, tied primarily to academia and inside-the-Capital-Beltway jobs.U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the junior senator from Texas, urged the Senate to thoroughly review Kagan's record — and aired his trepidations about it.""There is no doubt that Ms. Kagan possesses a first-rate intellect, but she is a surprising choice from a president who has emphasized the importance of understanding 'how the world works and how ordinary people live,' "" Cornyn said in a May 10, 2010, press release. ""Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway. These are not places where one learns 'how ordinary people live.' ""For the record, Harvard Square refers to Kagan's work at Harvard Law School and Hyde Park is the neighborhood occupied by the University of Chicago, where Kagan once taught. We should note that Obama himself attended law school at Harvard, and his private home is in Chicago's Hyde Park. And his current employment is about as inside the D.C. Beltway as one can get.Putting aside the political argument that working in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway is not a good way to learn how ordinary people live, we decided to check Kagan's resume to find out if Cornyn is correct that the entirety of Kagan's career was spent in these three places.A judiciary committee questionnaire Kagan filled out after Obama nominated her for the solicitor general position in 2009 provides an accounting of her professional career.Working our way back from the present, here's Kagan's employment history (and, in parentheses, where they fit into Cornyn's definition): March 2009-present: U.S. solicitor general (D.C. Beltway)1999 -2009: professor and dean, Harvard Law School; 2003-2009 as dean; 2001-2009 as professor focusing on constitutional and administrative law; and 1999-2001 as visiting professor (Harvard Square)1997-1999: deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy (D.C.

Beltway-related) or that she worked for three summers during graduate school at New York City law firms.And White House officials argue Kagan's roots as the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, the daughter of a public school teacher and a tenant lawyer, and her career as an accomplished lawyer and well-regarded teacher solidify her ""ordinary people"" cred. Asked about this issue, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited Kagan's ""diversity of experience"" and noted that as solicitor general, Kagan ""represents the American people before the Supreme Court.""But it's fair to say that Kagan has spent the bulk of her professional career in academia at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School, and at various positions inside the Beltway. Again, whether that puts Kagan out of touch with ""how ordinary people live,"" is a political discussion.

More than 18,100 callers were opposed while 4,830 were in favor; about 75 percent of more than 350,000 letters that Hutchison received were against the reform, Sadosky said.Still, signals from Texas constituents don't necessarily demonstrate national sentiment. We turned next to polls taken before and after the final congressional action, which was followed in late March by Obama signing the plan into law.According to almost every poll we found, more Americans opposed action than favored it as the debate reached its climax.According to a Gallup poll taken March 4-7, weeks before the final votes, 48 percent of Americans said they would advise their representative to vote against an Obama health-care reform measure with 45 percent saying they’d advise a favorable vote.

The tally: 39 percent in favor, 59 percent against and 2 percent with no opinion. A Bloomberg poll taken those same days found 38 percent of respondents in favor, 50 percent opposed and 12 percent not sure.Some other polls showed a narrower approval/disapproval gap. A Quinnipiac University poll taken March 22-23 found 40 percent mostly approving of the health care system changes just passed by Congress, 49 percent mostly disapproving and 11 percent not knowing or answering.In a CBS News poll taken March 18-23, 42 percent said they approved of the ""current health care reform"" measure, 46 percent were opposed and 12 percent said they did not know or declined to answer. And a poll taken March 23-26 by The Washington Post found 46 percent of respondents supporting the changes to the health care system just enacted by Congress and Obama with 46 percent opposed.A Gallup poll taken in early April showed a near-even break between Americans saying passage of the plan was a bad thing and Americans saying it was good. Forty-nine percent of individuals polled April 8-11 said it was a bad thing with 45 percent saying it was good.Generally, Gallup writes, ""over the past year, Americans have been remarkably stable in their assessments of the bill, with neither supporters nor opponents able to generate sustained majority agreement with their position.""Doubts remain high in Texas, according to an April 14 telephone poll by Rasmussen Reports. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed likely voters favor a proposal to repeal the health care plan to stop it from taking effect, with 28 percent opposing such a move.Where does all this leave Hutchison’s claim of overwhelming opposition at the time lawmakers acted?Certainly, many Texans clamored against approval.

He said, however, ""we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.""

And NASA would have until 2015 to finalize plans for a heavy-lift rocket to carry astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit.Where does that leave Hutchison's claim that if the shuttle program is shuttered, Russia and China will be the only nations capable of launching humans into space?For starters: John Yembrick, a spokesman at the NASA office of space operations, told us that between the time the space-shuttle program is set to shut down later this year until the commercial sector becomes capable of sending astronauts into orbit — lately projected at 2015 — American astronauts would travel into space on Russian spacecrafts.Next, the Senate Commerce Committee pointed us to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website, where we brushed up on space-race history.The Soviet Union launched the first satellite to orbit Earth in 1957. Yuri Gargarin, a Russian, became the first person to travel in space in 1961; Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on the moon in 1969. In 2003, China sent its first astronaut into space. In 2004, test pilot Michael Melvill became the first astronaut launched into space by a private company — Scaled Composites of Mojave, California.Most U.S. astronauts work for NASA, and live and train at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Their Russian counterparts, cosmonauts, train near Moscow and launch from and land in Kazakhstan, the nation sharing part of Russia's southeast border. NASA launches astronauts into space aboard shuttles while cosmonauts travel aboard space vehicles called Soyuz, which, unlike the shuttles, are not reusable. Both 'nauts helped build and then worked aboard the space station.Byron Tapley, director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, said other countries are striving to launch people into space, including India, Japan, Ecuador, Iran and Malaysia. ""India and Japan are the most developed of this set,"" Tapley said. ""But neither is very close to being able to claim 'current capability.' The capability for safely placing a human in orbit is much more demanding than the capability for placing a satellite in orbit.""We rate Hutchison's statement as True.","/personalities/john-kerry/,/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/",,"Science,Texas,Kay Bailey Hutchison",,,,,

Here's the exchange with interviewer Jake Tapper:Tapper: ""President Obama officials say he's contemplating presenting a peace plan to help jump start the process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What advice do you give President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace plan?""Clinton: ""Well, I never share advice that I give directly to any president."" Tapper: ""Well then, hypothetically?"" Clinton: ""Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations again to deal with these very difficult final status issues.""We zeroed in Clinton's claim that she doesn't answer ""hypotheticals."" Politicians often say that, but they'll answer them when it's in their political interest. Such is the case with Clinton.  Indeed, we found several instances of Clinton batting away hypothetical questions, just as she did with Tapper:• In an interview with the BBC last October, when asked about sanctions for Iran if it acquires a nuclear weapon, she said, ""I don't want to get ahead of myself and I don't want to answer a hypothetical. I think it's important that we stay together, we keep moving together, and we stay committed to the same goal, which is to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons pile.""• During a CNN interview a few weeks later on the same topic, she answered, ""Well, I don't want to speculate or answer a hypothetical. I want this process to play out.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021• In June 2007, Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton about using military force to stop genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. ""Well, but, we're not going to engage in these hypotheticals,"" she said. ""I mean, one of the jobs of a president is being very reasoned in approaching these issues, and I don't think it's useful to be talking in these kind of abstract, hypothetical terms.""• She protested hypotheticals again in a debate moderated by Tim Russert in February 2008, when Russert asked, if ""al-Qaida resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?"" Clinton answered, ""You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals,"" before answering broadly, ""You have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.""But every so often, Clinton will answer hypotheticals. We found a few examples in the presidential campaign where her answer allowed her to distinguish herself from then-Sen. Barack Obama, to emphasize her hard-line approach on foreign affairs. During an April 2008 debate, she answered a question about what U.S. policy should be if Iran were to attack Israel. ""Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States, but I would do the same with other countries in the region,"" she said. A week later, in an interview with Keith Olbermann, she was asked what would constitute ""massive retaliation."" She didn't specifically answer his question, she didn't protest that it was hypothetical, either. Perhaps the most significant example we found was when Brian Williams asked candidates a stark hypothetical about terrorist attacks on the American homeland. He started with Obama.""Senator Obama, if, God forbid a thousand times, while we were gathered here tonight, we learned that two American cities had been hit simultaneously by terrorists, and we further learned beyond the shadow of a doubt it had been the work of al-Qaida, how would you change the U.S. military stance overseas as a result?"" Williams asked.Obama talked about managing an effective emergency response and making sure the United States had high-quality intelligence on who had attacked. Clinton didn't quibble about the hypothetical in this case and emphasized she would make a strong and swift response.""Well, again, having been a senator during 9/11, I understand very well the extraordinary horror of that kind of an attack and the impact that it has far beyond those who are directly affected,"" she said. ""I think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate. If we are attacked and we can determine who was behind that attack, and if there were nations that supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us, I believe we should quickly respond. Now, that doesn't mean we go looking for other fights. You know, I supported President Bush when he went after al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. And then when he decided to divert attention to Iraq, it was not a decision that I would have made had I been president, because we still haven't found bin Laden. So let's focus on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy them.""The next day, the Clinton campaign even promoted her response to the hypothetical, saying Clinton ""was the candidate who demonstrated that she would know how to respond if the country was attacked."" So Clinton has a mixed record on hypothetical questions. She's dodged many, as she did with Tapper, but she's also answered a fair number -- particularly when it suited her political goals.

Jeb Bush, says both Democrats and Republicans are advocating the use of student test scores to measure teachers' effectiveness.The group issued the claim in a bid to refute the notion that reform is ""a purely partisan effort"" at a time when an education bill making its way through the Florida Legislature is causing a political firestorm. It has grown so heated that the sergeants-at-arms had to form a barrier between angry educators and lawmakers at the end of a March 25, 2010, hearing of the House Pre-K-12 Policy Committee.The foundation made the claim in an e-mail sent to Florida political editors on March 26, 2010, entitled ''Myth vs. Fact: The Truth About Reform [Round Two] Modernizing Teacher Evaluations, Tenure and Compensation for the 21st Century.'' It goes on to say that reform advocates include President Barack Obama, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and cites Florida's business community as calling on the Florida Legislature to act on these issues. The e-mail contains many interesting facts, but we decided to focus on whether former Gov. Bush's own state – clearly a focus of the foundation's e-mail – is the bipartisan paradise his organization describes.On March 24, the Senate voted 21-17 to approve a bill (SB 6) that included language that would link teacher pay raises to student standardized tests rather than years of service. The legislation includes creation of a ''Performance Fund for Instructional Personnel and School-Based Administrators.'' The Associated Press reported that the bill passed ""the Republican-controlled Senate on largely party-line vote,"" over the opposition of ""the Florida Education Association,"" the statewide teachers union, which AP described as ""an important Democratic constituency group.""In the Senate roll call vote, four GOP senators broke with the party and voted against it. So did every single Democrat who voted on the measure. One of those who voted against it was Paula Dockery, the Lakeland Republican who is challenging Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum for their party's gubernatorial nomination. Two lawmakers – Sen. Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston – did not vote.The House version of the Senate bill (HB 7189) is pending a vote in the full House the week of April 5. It was approved by the House PreK-12 Policy Committee, 9-6, on March 25. Every Democrat voted against it along with one Republican, Mike Weinstein, R-Orange Park.Some opponents call it a union-busting bill. Other critics say linking teacher pay to pupils' performance on standardized tests would pile on more tests in an already test-preoccupied state. Moreover, parent-teacher groups opposing the measure – and urging the House to vote it down – are pushing for defeat of the legislation sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, a Republican and chairman of the state Republican party.Even former Gov. Bush on March 25, 2010 – the morning after the Florida Senate passed the bill – acknowledged a Republican-Democratic divide in talking about education reform efforts on the MSNBC cable network program Morning Joe.""I think Secretary Duncan and President Obama deserve credit for a) challenging a really powerful core constituency in their own party but b), more importantly, putting students first rather than the adults in the system,"" he said. ""And so there's all sorts of common ground now that is very exciting. And I think that is perhaps one of the reasons why there's a lot of new energy around this. But charter schools in places that historically haven’t had them, a stronger form of accountability, a real focus on children that lag behind, has yielded incredible results in places like Florida … ""President Obama and Duncan may be advocating some education reforms. But in response to a reporter's question on March 10, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs seemed to draw a distinction between ''merit pay'' and ''performance pay.''Here's part of the March 10 exchange:Q: So he does support merit pay increase for performance.MR. GIBBS: He supports the pay for performance, and I think a grand expansion of those ideas across a number of school districts was one of the many things – including early childhood education, changes in data and innovation -- that I think lay out the strong foundation for an educational reform agenda that the President believes will ultimately lead to increased economic growth.Moreover, Obama acknowledged the partisan rancor himself in a March 10, 2009, speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on a Complete and Competitive American Education: ""For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom.""...I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us – holding ourselves – accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, but new reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding good teachers, stop making excuses for bad ones.""Patricia Levesque of the Foundation for Florida's Future says the ""Myth vs Fact"" claim intentionally focused on the federal landscape, which is more favorable to the notion of rewarding teachers for accomplishment in the classroom. Asked why Florida Democrats don't follow what she sees as a national trend, she replied: ""That's the million-dollar question.

A few days after the U.S. House approved the health care plan, Crist ran a radio ad criticizing that plan as ""Washington liberals forcing government takeover of health care"" and touting Florida's own program.""But in Florida,"" the narrator says, ""one leader already enacted common sense conservative solutions: Charlie Crist. As governor, Crist passed Cover Florida. Now Floridians can take charge of their own health care through market-based strategies. Thousands already enrolled and climbing."" Health coverage is a major issue in Florida because about 20 percent of Floridians lack insurance -- about 3.6 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Before we analyze Crist's claim about the Cover Florida enrollment figures, it's helpful to know some basics about the program.Crist signed Cover Florida into law in May 2008, but enrollment did not begin until January 2009, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration. Floridians who have lacked health insurance for at least six months or are recently unemployed are eligible. The program offers coverage from six different health insurance companies with either catasrophic coverage that includes hospital stays or a more pared-down plan without hospitalization benefits.The Cover Florida Web site boasts that insurance can be purchased for as little as $23.70 a month, but monthly rates vary depending on level of coverage and other factors such as age and gender. For example in Broward County, the average monthly rate ranges from $50.75 with no emergency or hospital services, to $327.27 for more coverage. ""This legislation makes affordable health coverage available to 3.8 million uninsured Floridians through a comprehensive market-based strategy,"" according to the Cover Florida Web site.Now, a look at the enrollment figures.Crist's claim -- ""thousands already enrolled and climbing"" -- suggests it is a large initiative with significant growth. But for a state with about 3.6 million uninsured, the enrollment numbers are tiny and the growth is modest.They went from 952 in January/February of 2009 to 5,426 in December 2009, the most recent numbers available. The program added roughly 750 people per month in the first few months, but the growth slowed to only 180 from November to December. So the numbers have gone up, but they remain a tiny percentage of of the uninsured -- about 0.1 percent of all the uninsured Floridians. ""It's such a miniscule number and it's just definitely not the answer to getting millions of Floridians insured,'' said Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich of Weston, vice chair of the health and human services appropriations committee. ""It's clear people do not see it as the answer for providing access. I don't want to totally disregard it, some people are in it.""Technically, Crist is correct: ""thousands"" have already enrolled -- but barely more than 5 . . . thousands. And he is also technically correct to say enrollment is ""climbing"" because the number of participants has grown every month. Yet we think listeners of Crist's radio ad will get the impression that their governor has introduced a large program that is growing rapidly and making significant progress in covering Florida's 3.6 million uninsured. But it's a tiny effort that is growing a small amount.

He went on to say that he's only had a few experiences with the sport, but that, ""I know a lot of people, former professional athletes, who go into shock after hearing they can't go fishing anymore because of Obama.""Like so many claims we check at PolitiFact, this one was messy. It started, of all places, with a story from ESPNOutdoors.com, was picked up by conservative bloggers, and then made its way to Limbaugh's radio show and other outlets including Glenn Beck's evening program on Fox News. In the process, the story changed.So, we'll do our best to sort through the rhetorical rubble.To support his claim, Limbaugh points to an article that appeared on ESPNOutdoors.com on March 9, 2010. The article, written by Robert Montgomery, reported that, ""The Obama administration will accept no more public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" This quote was pulled from the Web site of left-wing media watchdog Media Matters. Montgomery later changed his column, so the original language is no longer on the ESPNOutdoors site. But more about that later.Montgomery was writing about Obama's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, a 24-member group headed by the chair of Obama's Council on Environmental Quality. In June 2009, Obama created the task force to develop a national policy to protect, maintain and restore oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes. He asked the group recommend a framework for improved stewardship and effective coastal and marine spatial planning; the group released a draft of its recommendations in December 2009. Among other things, it recommends creating nine regional planning areas to carry out the framework. In plain English, the Obama administration is drafting new plans for waterway conservation. ""Spatial planning"" is jargon for making sure that waterways are being used in the most economically and environmentally friendly way, explained Beth Lowell, federal policy director for ocean conservation group Oceana. If a body of water has no biological value, perhaps it's best used for a wind farm, she gave as an example. Or if there's a vulnerable coral reef in the area, the framework will help sort out what kinds of fishing can be done on the surface so as not to disturb the ecosystem below.So, the framework may mean changes in fishing practices in some areas, depending on the location, the local economy and specific ecological problems. Indeed, the draft framework states that plans ""are expected to vary from region to region according to the specific needs, capacity, and issues particular to each region."" Almost instantaneously, conservative bloggers picked up on Montgomery's story. Michelle Malkin wrote, ""Sacrificing jobs for the green agenda. Conducting Kabuki theater on public input. Business as usual for the Obama White House.""And from Gateway Pundit: ""Obama’s latest assault on your rights– He wants to ban sport fishing. Barack Obama has a message for America’s 60,000,000 anglers – We don't need you."" The meme found its way to the desks of Limbaugh and of Beck, who implied on his March 10, 2010, show that Obama was banning fishing by executive order.""Obama will no longer listen to the public as he tries to prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing on some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas and Great Lakes and even some inland waters,"" he said. ""No more fishing. . . . Some environmentalists want to save the fish. Forget about the frickin' fish! People are losing their rights.""(We should point out that Obama has not banned fishing through executive order, so Beck is wrong on that point.)The firestorm prompted ESPNOutdoors executive editor Steve Bowman to issue a statement on the story. He wrote that the news organization should have made it clear that the story was an opinion column in a series of stories on the implications of Obama's new task force. ""While our series overall has examined several sides of the topic, this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view,"" Bowman wrote. ""We have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view -- if they chose to respond -- throughout the series, but failed to do so in this specific column.""Media Matters also noted that the first paragraph of Montgomery's story now reads that the administration's plan ""could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" (The emphasis is ours to show the difference between Montgomery's first and second iteration of the column.)The column still fails to mention that the administration has made no final decisions on the recommendations. And while the framework could change some fishing practices as Lowell points out, the draft proposals do not say anything about banning recreational fishing as the column implies. Here's what Christine Glunz, spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, had to say about the issue: ""The draft reports issued by the Ocean Policy Task Force have involved extensive stakeholder input and public participation as they were being prepared, which has included the interests of conservationists and the recreational fishing community. These draft reports are not map-drawing exercises, they do not contain a zoning plan, and they do not establish any restrictions on recreational fishing or on public access, nor make any judgments about whether one ocean activity or use is better than another.''And Eric Schwaab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assistant administrator for fisheries, simply stated in a March 10, 2010, statement that ""the Ocean Policy Task Force has not recommended a ban on recreational fishing."" Like many things we check at PolitiFact, this claim is like sausage: It went in the meat processor that is the Internet as one thing and came out quite different. An opinion piece that argued Obama's effort could ban some fishing was chopped up, reprocessed and put back together as a claim that Obama wants to ban all fishing. In fact, the draft framework says nothing about banning fishing. Limbaugh has taken an early discussion about the use of waterways and twisted it to make it sound like Obama is outlawing a popular pastime. While the panel's recommendation could change fishing practices in some areas, the framework is still in draft form; the administration has not made any final decisions on what the framework will look like. But Limbaugh is grossly distorting the truth. Pants on Fire! Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

""In its life [health care reform] will create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately."" To be clear: Pelosi was not arguing that the bill would literally put people to work in the field of health care. Rather, she claims that cheaper health care will allow businesses to hire more workers, thus creating more jobs. ""Imagine an economy where people could change jobs, start businesses, become self-employed, whether to pursue their artistic aspirations or be entrepreneurial and start new businesses, if they were not job-locked because they have a child who's bipolar, or a family member who's diabetic with a pre-existing condition, and all of the other constraints that having health care or not having health care places on an entrepreneurial spirit,"" she said.We'll start out by noting that both sides claim that health care reform will either create or destroy many jobs.The Democrats assume that their bills will make health care less expensive, meaning that employers will have more money to hire more workers. For instance, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimated in December that health care reform could create 320,000 additional jobs. The Republicans, however, are claiming the opposite. They maintain that the House and Senate versions of the bill, as well as a recently released proposal by Obama, would levy such hefty fines on employers -- if they don't offer their employees health insurance -- that employers would end up laying off workers to keep costs down. To back up this claim, they point to a Congressional Budget Office report from July 2009 that cited several older studies. One study from 2007 estimates that 224,000 workers could be unemployed if employers were required to provide insurance that cost, on average, $2 per hour worked. A second study, also published in 2007, found that an employer mandate could cost about 750,000 jobs. But that study also took into account a minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $7.25, the current rate.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Ultimately, the CBO concludes that requiring employers to offer health insurance will reduce employment, but the effect ""would probably be small."" Another study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the employer mandate in June 2009. At the time, the Senate bill would have required employers who do not offer insurance to fully cover the cost of coverage for their lowest income employees who purchase insurance through a new health care insurance exchange. The group concluded that such a requirement could deter employers from hiring low-wage workers and might ultimately lead to job losses. All this information shows that health care reform may have some impact on employment, but there's a catch: Since the CBO and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did those analyses, the Senate has changed its bill to say that employers will not be required to offer insurance, but that employers with 50 or more employees must help workers defray the cost if they qualify for new tax credits to help buy insurance. Obama's proposal includes similar language. Employers with 50 or more workers that don't provide coverage would be penalized, but the proposal would exempt the first 30 workers when calculating a $2,000 per worker fine. That background is meant to demonstrate one thing: The House, Senate and Obama proposals are moving targets. As a result, it is nearly impossible to quantify with any certainty how many jobs will be created -- or lost -- from health care reform. And we want to emphasize here, we've found no studies on lost jobs that examine the current proposals, which include fines but not full employer mandates. So, we asked Pelosi's office for more information. Her spokesman, Nadeam Elshami, pointed us to a recent study by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning public policy think tank. According to the report, ""one important way to create jobs is to slow the growth of medical spending. If health care cost increases slow down, then businesses will find it more profitable to expand employment, and workers will more readily move into those new jobs.""The study is a combination of data collected by Neeraj Sood, a professor at the University of Southern California who has looked at the impact of rising health care costs on employment, and David Cutler, a economist at Harvard University who has studied the impact of health care reform on care and insurance premiums.The initial impact of health care reform would be lower administrative costs, the authors argue. Those costs are associated with the marketing, underwriting and brokers’ fees charged by health insurance companies. The authors also argue that health care reform would make treatment more cost effective. Eventually, those efficiencies would trickle down to employers; in short, they won't have to pay as much to cover their employees and can instead use that extra cash to hire more workers. All told, the authors of the report estimate that health care reform could produce, on average, 250,000 to 400,000 jobs a year over the next decade. To come up with those job numbers, Cutler and Sood modeled two scenarios. In the first, medical cost reductions would occur at a moderate 0.75 percentage points annually, producing an average of 250,000 jobs every year. In the more aggressive scenario, medical cost reductions are as high as 1.5 percent annually, producing an average of 400,000 jobs per year. In reality, the number of jobs produced per year would vary, according to the report. For instance, in 2013, the number of jobs created under the second scenario would be about 210,000. That number would climb to nearly 800,000 in 2019.So, in her statement, Pelosi assumes that 400,000 jobs are created every year for a total of 4 million over 10 years. But Pelosi is cherry-picking the most optimistic number from one study. A more moderate rate of reduction could produce fewer jobs per year, according to the report. Furthermore, she fails to mention that the 400,000 is an average, meaning that some years could produce a higher number of jobs and others could produce fewer jobs. And finally, there's clearly a lot of uncertainty about whether the health care bill, with its fines on employers who don't provide health insurance, will create jobs or cut jobs. As a result, we find Pelosi's claim Half True.","/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Economy,Health Care,Nancy Pelosi",,,,,

""But what about Dad’s opponent?"" one says, without naming the foe, lobbyist Tim Tuggey.The other replies: ""Dad’s opponent is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage.""Mercer closes: ""You bet, I approve this message.""But would the Texas Truth-O-Meter approve? We decided to appraise Tuggey’s donations and the viewpoints of Democrats who fielded his contributions.Mercer shared with us a list indicating Tuggey has given nearly $43,000 to 19 Democratic candidates and three pro-Democratic political committees since 2001.He's right. Our check of state and federal records shows that Tuggey's donations to Democrats amounted to $33,616 to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus $9,100 donated to 10 Democratic candidates for state office.Tuggey doesn’t deny he’s helped Democrats. But he also says that since 2004, he and his law firm have given about three times as much money to Republicans.On his campaign Web site, he notes that his firm has represented the Bexar County Republican Party at no charge. The site says his firm also represented the state’s Republican U.S. House members in the last round of redistricting litigation and it represents only Republicans in campaign and ethics disputes.Tuggey initially told us all his Democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans’ care. He later conceded that in some cases, he pitched in for candidates simply because they asked for a donation.Mercer said the second part of his blast—that the Tuggey-assisted Democrats ""support abortion and same-sex marriage"" is based on the Democratic Party platform.""The Republican platform is clearly pro-life (and anti-abortion) and pro-traditional marriage,"" Mercer said. ""The Democrat Party platform is not.""Mercer didn’t say so, but his ad's reference to Democrats supporting abortion was a shorthand stab that absurdly suggests Democrats want abortions to occur — a claim that's not the same as favoring a woman's right to have an abortion.Besides, not all Democrats support abortion rights. ""We are a big-tent party,"" said Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the state Democrats. ""There are Democrats who support the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy and there are Democrats who don’t.""As for where Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, we didn't check with every Democrat who got a Tuggey donation. But one of them, state Sen. Carlos Uresti of San Antonio, said he’s never supported same-sex marriage.""Absolutely not,"" Uresti said. ""I’m a Marine, damnit."" (Uresti said he voted in 2005 in favor of placing a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters, who later approved the proposal. In the official House record, however, Uresti is listed as absent from the floor vote that advanced the measure.)Mercer's reasoning presumes that every Democrat who fielded a Tuggey donation hews to the party’s state and national platforms, statements of beliefs drafted and adopted by party convention delegates every two years at the state level and every four years at the national level. So we looked for language relating to abortion and same-sex marriage in the latest Democratic platforms.What we found: The state party platform of 2008 states Texas Democrats ""trust the women of Texas to make personal and responsible decisions about when and whether to bear children, in consultation with their family, their physician, personal conscience or their God, rather than having these personal decisions made by politicians.""Texas Democrats also ""support prevention measures which have proven effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, and which would reduce the rate of abortion when made affordable, accessible, and available as effective long-term programs,"" the platform states.The national Democratic platform of 2008 states: ""The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade (the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.""Same-sex marriage isn't mentioned in the state Democrats’ platform. But there is language indicating the party believes in protecting personal privacy and opposing discrimination in ""all forms.""The national Democratic platform states: ""We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections. We will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non-discrimination act. We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us.""The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal laws, and provides that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex.So does Mercer’s ad hold up?Mercer got the math part right. Tuggey actually gave more than $42,000 to Democrats or Democratic committees, though Mercer's ad overlooks Tuggey's donations to Republicans and the history of Tuggey’s firm representing the Bexar County Republican Party and GOP candidates.But the second part of Mercer's advertising statement doesn't add up.For starters, Mercer doesn't back up his presumption that every Democrat hews to the party's platform. It also doesn't stand to reason that support for same-sex marriage amounts to non-support of traditional marriage, as Mercer said.In Mercer's favor: Both the state and national Democratic Party platforms signal Democratic support for abortion rights. But the 2008 state platform doesn't address same-sex marriage while the national platform backs equal protections for same-sex couples with no reference to marriage.Mercer accurately tallied Tuggey's donations to Democrats, but made sweeping judgments unsupported by facts.We rate his statement as Barely True.Featured Fact-checkJenna Wadsworthstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweetNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.""By Paul Specht • February 1, 2021Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

Kim • February 1, 2021We looked at several of the items on this list to see if they were as billed. Here, we will examine the claim that ""$15 million (in stimulus) dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165.""This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a CBS Evening News report on July 13, 2009. ""That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident,"" the report said.""Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights,"" the CBS report states. ""And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway.""A lengthier story three days later in the Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq.Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus: ""The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States — home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights.""Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the Kodiak Daily Mirror, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road. ""I’m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services,"" Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the Kodiak Daily Mirror. ""They are essential, whether you’re talking about five people or 5,000.""Quick also said planes have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were transported via skiff. ""I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out,"" added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. ""I feel it's for the safety of our community.""In an opinion piece for the Anchorage Press, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report ""sensationalizing"" and told people to ""quit picking on Ouzinkie."" Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, ""The point is that we should think carefully about what’s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie’s lifeline will continue to be someone else’s taxpayer waste.""On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.","/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Stimulus,John Boehner",,,,,

Rick Perry issued an executive order in 2007 requiring all Texas girls to receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus before entering the sixth grade, lawmakers balked and blocked it.Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young.Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, one of Perry's opponents in the GOP gubernatorial primary, frequently slams Perry's stilled order.Perry has stood by his action, most recently casting it as having created an optional vaccination requirement.""That piece of legislation was not mandatory, in the sense of when you can say no, something's not mandatory,"" he said during the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29.A just-say-no gubernatorial order? We decided to check.What we found: On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order — not a piece of legislation, as he said — requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade to receive a vaccination against the types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, that causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts.The order included an opt-out ""in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care."" Perry ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form, which has been available since 2003, enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information.According to the Department of State Health Service's 2008-09 immunization report, which uses data from kindergarten and seventh-grade students at 1,300 independent school districts and 800 private schools, 0.28 percent of the students filed conscientious objection forms.Parents must renew exemption affidavits every two years to maintain their validity, according to Allison Lowery, assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services.We thought the opt-out form for public-school students proved Perry correct until we learned that not all private schools accept the affidavit. That means some private schools may not allow their students to exempt themselves from any state-required vaccinations. Some 15 percent of more than 1 million Texas girls in fifth through 12th grade in 2008 were enrolled in private schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.According to a 2006 Texas Attorney General's opinion: ""A private school that does not accept state tax funds is not required to accept for enrollment a child who has received an exemption from the immunizations required by the Texas Health and Safety Code.""In its policy for Catholic schools, the Catholic Diocese of Austin states: ""Immunizations are not in conflict with the Catholic faith. Conscientious objections or waivers, which may be permissible for enrollment in public schools, do not qualify as an exception to this policy."" Catholic schools in the diocese do accept medical exemptions, meaning if the immunization could somehow harm the child, it's not required to enroll.We wondered if the diocese's policy in favor of requiring state-mandated immunizations would have extended to refusing the opt-out form for girls subject to the HPV vaccination.Perry aides may have had the same question. According to internal e-mails published online by Hutchison's campaign (also obtained by the Austin American-Statesman under Texas open records laws in 2007), Brandon LeBlanc, then the governor's community affairs public liaison, wrote Feb. 6, 2007: ""I don't have an answer for the questions I'm getting regarding private schools. Apparently Catholic schools in particular will require all state vaccines, but won't except (sic) the exemptions. My first inclination, assuming this is true, is that this is for the parents and the schools to sort out. Is there a better answer to this 'problem'?""Nora Belcher, then assistant director at the Governor's Office of Budget, Planning and Policy, replied: ""I believe in the short term your answer is the correct one, plus, enrolling in Catholic school is a CHOICE (for parents, anyway).""In February 2007, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Texas came close to saying they wouldn't require the vaccine, issuing a statement recommending that ""civil authorities should leave this decision to parents.""But would parochial schools absolutely have left that particular vaccination decision to parents? Margaret McGettrick, director of education at the Texas Catholic Conference, the statewide association of the Roman Catholic diocese in Texas, recently said the superintendents, bishops and accreditation commission at the association responsible for setting school policies never formulated policy specific to the HPV vaccine.McGettrick said ""it's a non-issue for us"" because the HPV vaccine was never added to the state's list of required immunizations once lawmakers froze the order until the starting date of the 2011 regular legislative session.Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: ""We consider (the order) null and void and (Perry) will not pursue it in the future.""En breve: Perry did issue an order requiring schoolgirls receive the HPV vaccine. In arguing that his order was not a mandate, Perry points to the Conscientious Objection to Immunization form that lets parents of public school students decline immunizations without consequence. The burden to file and refile the notarized forms on time falls on the parents.However, our research determined that it's not certain the opt-out would have been accepted for the 15 percent of Texas girls attending private schools. Also unknown: Whether every Catholic school would have allowed students subject to Perry's order to abstain from the three HPV shots in the vaccination series.Ultimately, the governor issued an order for the Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner to ""adopt rules that mandate the age appropriate vaccination of all female children for HPV prior to admission to the sixth grade.""According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a mandate is ""a clear instruction, authorization or direction."" Perry says the executive order wasn't mandatory, which, according to Webster, means ""demanded or required.""But that's what Perry's order did: it set up a requirement. Just because there's a loophole — a way to ""say no,"" in the governor's parlance — doesn't mean the requirement doesn't exist. Physical education classes are also mandatory to graduate high school, but if you have any number of health conditions, you can skip the timed mile.We rate Perry's claim Barely True.Featured Fact-checkJohn Kerrystated on January 31, 2021 in in an interviewSays that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”By Brandon Mulder • February 5, 2021Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household.""",,politifact,,"Recently elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell took up the flag for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010.That meant talking about spending, deficits and debt.""In the past year, more than 3 million people have lost their jobs, and yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending, adding to the bureaucracy, and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren,"" McDonnell said in a speech from the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. ""The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household. This is simply unsustainable.""We wanted to check two things: Whether the debt is growing as fast as McDonnell says, and whether it now constitutes $100,000 per household.First things first -- a quick but critical lesson on the federal debt. The debt clock you're use to seeing, the one that's ticking past $12.3 trillion these days, actually is the summation of two types of debt. The first part is the money the government borrowed to pay for things -- wars, roads, whatever. The second is debt held by government trust funds and government accounts that are internal transactions (government passing money from one fund to another). In these cases, there is no effect on the credit markets. (Read the Treasury Department's Q&A on debt here.)The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, says the first form of debt is a more meaningful measure. It's the combination of both types of debt, however, that gets most noticed, surely because it's bigger but also because it's what the debt ceiling is based on. McDonnell's claim that the debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 is not a new talking point for Republicans. Judd Gregg (the Republican senator from New Hampshire who was almost Obama's commerce secretary) said the same thing about Obama's proposed 2010 budget last March.To check Gregg, we relied on a Congressional Budget Office analysis from March 20, 2009. The CBO projected that the debt held by the public (the first part of the total debt) would rise from $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008 -- which is Sept. 30, 2008 -- to $11.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013; and to $17.3 trillion in 2019 under Obama's proposed FY 2010 budget. By that count, Gregg's claim of doubling the debt in five years, tripling it in 10 years, is correct.But in Gregg's case we found it a little unfair to tie some of the debt to Obama and not President George W. Bush. We rated Gregg's claim Mostly True.Now on to McDonnell.Just hours ahead of McDonnell's response, the CBO released updated baseline debt projections that shrink the amount of debt predicted over the next 10 years. The CBO put the debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2008 at $5.8 trillion, $7.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2009, and estimates the debt will increase to $11.6 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2014 and to $14.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2019. Again, this is just the first part of the debt calculation. That's a decrease from the projections the CBO put out in response to Obama's 2010 budget. In checking this claim, like when considering Gregg's claim, the truth depends on where you start counting the debt.If you set your baseline as Sept. 30, 2008, the national debt is on pace to nearly triple by Sept. 30, 2019, as McDonnell suggests. If you recalculate for Sept. 30, 2009, the national debt doubles, not triples in 10 years. Now, for argument's sake, we wanted to run the same calculation for the entire gross federal debt. (You will see why this matters in a second.) According to the CBO, the gross federal debt ended 2009 at $11.9 trillion, will hit $16.7 trillion by the end of 2014 and $20.6 trillion by the end of 2019. That's short of McDonnell's marks as well. The percentages don't improve much even if you roll back to 2008 -- we're talking again about doubling the debt after 10 years, not tripling. So unlike comparing the debt held by the public, McDonnell's numbers are off whether you start counting Sept. 30, 2008, or Sept. 30, 2009. White House debt projections from August 2009 are a slightly worse, but not enough to make a change when considering McDonnell's claim.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021As we try to digest all of that, let's turn to the second part of McDonnell's claim: ""The federal debt is already over $100,000 per household.""The Census Bureau estimated in 2007 that there were nearly 116 million U.S. households. The current debt held by the public -- the money the government has borrowed -- is $7.8 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The current gross debt is $12.3 trillion.Presto, chango, carry the one, move the decimal point ... and you get two different debt per household figures.The household share of the debt owed by the public is about $67,000. The household share of the gross federal debt is slightly more than $106,000.McDonnell's press secretary, Stacey Johnson, did not return two phone calls or an e-mail asking for clarification on what debt figures the governor was using to make his calculations.Why does it matter?If he's using the gross debt figure -- the big one -- McDonnell is right about the per household number and wrong about the doubling and tripling.If he's using the smaller debt held by the public number, he has a case to make about growth of the debt, but is wrong when it comes to the per household share.Or he's mixing one form of debt to make one point, and another to make a second.In his State of the Union response, McDonnell tried using both the macro and the micro to drive home a point that spending led by the Democrats in the White House and Congress is out of control. His claim that national debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 isn't wildly off, but it ignores the fact that some of the responsibility falls on Bush's shoulders. On his second claim, that the per household share of the national debt is more than $100,000, that's true if you measure the gross federal debt and false if you only count the money the government actually borrowed from somebody else. On the whole, we rate McDonnell's statement Half True.","http://www.usdebtclock.org/,https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm#DebtMakeup,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/25/judd-gregg/judd-gregg-says-obamas-budget-doubles-national-deb/,https://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/Frontmatter.shtml,https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_msr/10msr.pdf,/personalities/charlie-kirk/,/factchecks/2021/jan/28/charlie-kirk/biden-did-not-admit-hes-governing-dictator/,https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hh-fam/cps2007.html",,"National,Federal Budget,Bob McDonnell",,,,,

Recently, a decision by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the club of rich nations -- to invite Chile to become a member has become, for many on the right, symbolic of how adhering to free-market principles can vault former Third World countries into economic affluence.In a video blog post dated Jan. 15, 2010, conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck championed Chile as a nation no longer ""struggling with poverty,"" having overcome a reputation for corruption and bureaucracy through such policies as freer labor markets and lower taxes.In addition to citing the OECD invitation, Beck pointed to its high standing in recent international ratings of ""economic freedom.""""They ranked 71st of 72 in 1975 in a study of economic freedom in the world,"" Beck said in his video blog post. ""Now, in that same study, they rank third. The U.S. is ranked 17th.""We wondered whether Chile is really that far ahead of the U.S. in ""economic freedom,"" so we looked at the data.We located an editorial in Investor's Business Daily -- a leading voice for free-market capitalism -- that appears to be the source of Beck's statistic.The editorial, published Dec. 4, 2009, was later picked up by a smattering of conservative bloggers on its way to Beck's desk. The editorial said in part, ""In the Cato Institute's 1975 Economic Freedom of the World Report, [Chile] ranked a wretched 71 out of 72 countries evaluated. Today it's a different country altogether. Embracing markets has made it one of the most open economies in the world, ranking third on Cato's index, just behind Hong Kong and Singapore."" Later on, the editorial added that the United States ""ranks just 17th on Cato's 2009 Index of Economic Freedom.""However, if you look at the 2009 Economic Freedom of the World study by Cato -- a libertarian think tank in Washington -- the numbers were actually different. Hong Kong and Singapore did indeed rank 1 and 2, respectively, but then came New Zealand and Switzerland before Chile at No. 5. In the No. 6 spot, behind by a fraction of a point, was the United States. So while it's true that, by Cato's reckoning, Chile ranked ahead of the United States, it was less of a blowout than Beck or IBD indicated.We also looked at the two prior years' Cato studies to make sure that Beck wasn't simply off by a year. That wasn't the case. In the 2008 study, Chile ranked No. 6 with the United States at 8, in a two-way tie with Australia and once again behind by a fraction of a point. And in the 2007 study, the United States actually ranked higher than Chile. The United States was tied for fifth while Chile was tied for 11th.One of the co-authors of Cato's 2009 study -- Joshua Hall, a Beloit College economist -- also confirmed to PolitiFact that the United States has never ranked as low as 17th in all the years that study has been conducted. Another co-author, James Gwartney, a Florida State University economist, confirmed that Beck was correct in saying that Chile ranked 71st out of 72 countries in 1975.In the meantime, we also looked at whether Beck (or IBD) had mistaken the Cato study for a different report. As it happens, there are at least three other studies that attempt to rank the nations of the world based on ""economic freedom"" or a similar yardstick.The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom. In 2009, the United States ranked sixth in its study while Chile ranked 11th.The World Economic Forum, a Geneva-based international organization, publishes an annual Global Competitiveness Index. Its 2009-10 ratings peg the United States at No. 2 and Chile at 30.Finally, the World Bank publishes an annual ""Doing Business"" ranking that seeks to measure which countries have a regulatory environment ""conducive to the operation of business."" In this tally, the United States finished fourth overall with Chile 49th.Given these ratings, it would seem unlikley that Beck or IBD could have accidentally been referring to any of these studies.However, we would be remiss if we failed to add that, despite the apparent flub on reporting the rankings, Beck's overall assessment of Chile's recent economic history is largely accurate.We spoke with three experts on Latin American economics and politics who work with centrist-to-liberal think tanks -- Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, Andres Martinez of the New America Foundation and Leonardo Martinez-Diaz of the Brookings Institution -- and they agreed that there is a broad ideological consensus on Beck's two key points: Namely, Chile has improved its economic position in recent years and that free-market policies can take some of the credit.""If trends continue, Chile will soon be considered one of those rare countries that has graduated out of the developing world, according to plenty of living-standard indices,"" Andres Martinez said. ""The country is also the poster child for those who believe globalization and free trade can lift living standards, as Chile's economic course has long been anchored in its free-trade agreement with the U.S. and its dynamic export sector. It also stands out among South American countries in that its governing socialists have pragmatically been the ones embracing this pro-business, market-oriented economy.""So while there is some truth to Beck's underlying point that Chile has improved its economic freedom, he's wrong to portray Chile as ranking far ahead of the United States. By several measures, the United States ranks significantly higher than Chile; in one, Chile is slightly ahead.So we find his claim Barely True.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

""Even though there's suggestions at the national level that this could be a very Republican year, I can't assume that it's going to be a very Republican year. And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign.""     Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say ""aye"" or ""nay.""     First, we turned to  Congressional Quarterly  , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to  CQ  's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The  Washington Post   also compiles  similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.)     What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the  Des Moines Register, noting that the senator has become ""the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes.""     Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time.     Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it.     ""Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep,""  he Tweeted  the night of the 18th. ""Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive.""     Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote.

They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family.The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated  Pants on Fire  ). The e-mail says, ""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded.""We've spent a lot of time  looking into claims  about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills.We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year.The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology.Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer.The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year.So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure.

""What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?""""Here's the point,"" Hannity said, ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.""We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the ""global war on terrorism"" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times.So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.""Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.""The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.""Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?""Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.""So Obama isn't fond of the phrase ""war on terror."" But did that ever become blanket White House policy?According to aWashington Poststory in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said ""this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or ""Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' "" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told theWashington Postthere was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of ""a career civil servant.""Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term ""war on terror,"" or the like, very often.Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words ""terror"" or ""terrorism"" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.The absence of those words ""goes to the heart"" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon ina speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studieson Aug. 6, 2009.""As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people.

""That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.""Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the ""war on terror."" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism."" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase ""war on terror,"" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase ""war on terrorism.""

Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit.""If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this — all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast,"" Matalin said. ""Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government.""So, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years.Last spring, we checked  a similar claim  made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window.Matalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue,  two   about  a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the  Telegraph  that, ""as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale.""Another study  , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the  Australian  newspaper argued that ""global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002.""Carter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities — including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States — track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record.But no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled.  This graph  from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise.  This graph  from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005.We asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs.At the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend.""With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer,"" Heim said. ""It's two steps up, two steps down — that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend.""NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently  told the Associated Press  the same thing:""The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,"" he said. ""Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.""If 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years.A decade is such a small period of time that ""it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'"" Bradley said.It's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away.""If you just take a one-year comparison — say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 — that's an improper use of statistics"" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then.""Indeed,  climate   records  show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years.Jim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected.""In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average,"" Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart.Citing just the last 10 years ""is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story,"" he said.Matalin said, ""for the last decade the climate has been cooling."" That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said.

So during a recent trip to China, Pelosi discussed how the issues overlap during a meeting with the country's president, Hu Jintao.She recounted the meeting for television host Charlie Rose on the Oct. 5, 2009, edition of his show. ""I took a little bit of a different approach this time in terms of talking about environmental justice because . . . 750,000 people, approximately, die in China each year from auto emissions. The Gobi Desert is encroaching on the rest of China. There are sandstorms in Beijing. They know that . . . there's something that has to be done about climate change and environmental protection and that — and so my pitch to them is there has to be environmental justice. As you develop and as you compete, you can't leave people behind.""We wondered if the death toll from auto emissions could possibly be as high as Pelosi claims.But first, some background. Most scientists believe that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, are due in part to the number of cars on the road that do not burn fuel efficiently. Our cars release greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun and have caused the Earth to warm. There's also evidence that the heat-trapping qualities of greenhouse gases lead to an increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere — bad news for those with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.We called Pelosi's office and they pointed us to 2007 news reports about a World Bank analysis that focused on the cost of pollution in China.According to theFinancial Times,the Chinese government asked the World Bank to exclude information about how many people die each year as the result of air and water pollution. (For its part, the World Bank says the numbers were left out due to ""some uncertainties about calculation methods and its application."")""Missing from this report are the research project’s findings that high air-pollution levels in Chinese cities (are) leading to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year,"" the July 2, 2007,Financial Timesstory said. ""A further 300,000 people die prematurely each year from exposure to poor air indoors, according to advisers, but little discussion of this issue survived in the report because it was outside the ambit of the Chinese ministries which sponsored the research.""On top of that, 60,000 premature deaths were related to poor-quality water that resulted in diarrhea, and stomach, liver and bladder cancers, according to the story.So, Pelosi is relying on a news story's summary of World Bank data that was not officially published but that was obtained by theFinancial Times.According to the news story, on the high end, there are 760,000 deaths annually from water and air pollution, not just auto emissions, as Pelosi said on theCharlie Rose Show.We took a look at the report, and found that it provided a lot of compelling evidence that Chinese citizens suffer a great deal from air and water pollution and that smog and dirty water in that country lead to many premature deaths. But it offered no overall numbers, nor did it focus specifically on auto emissions.""Energy consumption, especially coal consumption, is the main source of air pollutants,"" the report said, noting that medical evidence suggests ""outdoor air pollution is a contributing cause of morbidity and mortality.""To get another perspective, we called Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University, who has studied death rates due to carbon dioxide pollution. In 2008, he found that for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about 1,000 additional deaths in the United States, and 20,000 worldwide.That's on top of the approximately 2 million air pollution-related deaths worldwide, he explained, citing numbers from the World Health Organization.""Home heating and cooking are really the biggest source of deaths,"" Jacobson said, explaining that, particularly in China, India and other developing countries, cooking is often done with animal dung, wood or coal. ""There's a lot of smoke, no ventilation.""Indeed, most pollution-related deaths — about 1.6 million of the 2 million overall, according to the WHO — are the result of poor indoor air quality.According to WHO's numbers, that leaves only about 400,000 deaths annually that stem from outdoor pollution — worldwide. Furthermore, outdoor air pollution isn't limited to auto emissions. Much of it comes from agricultural operations, electricity generation and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, Jacobson said.So to summarize: Pelosi said that about 750,000 people in China die annually from auto emissions. But she was basing her claim on news reports that relied on data that was never actually published.  (When we inquired, the World Bank declined to directly address the statistics.) So even if the World Bank data is correct, Pelosi misinterpreted it by saying that all those deaths are related to auto emissions.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021On top of that, the World Health Organization estimates that most pollution-related deaths are the result of indoor pollutants (those coal and wood fires we mentioned above), not outdoor ones.

Bill Nelson of Florida, who say cutting the program isn't fair to people who are currently enrolled in the optional Medicare program.Obama vigorously defended his plan. Medicare Advantage programs, he said, get ""about 14 percent more (in) overpayments, basically subsidies from taxpayers for a program that ordinary Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy.""Now, they package these things in ways that, in some cases, may make it more convenient for some consumers, but they're overcharging massively for it.""Obama added that he would use the money to close the so-called ""doughnut hole,"" a gap in prescription drug coverage for seniors.We know from our  previous reporting  that Medicare Advantage is more costly than regular Medicare. But we were curious if it had been proven that Medicare and Medicare Advantage produced the same patient outcomes.For those who need a little help on Medicare basics: Traditional Medicare is health insurance that the government offers to senior citizens. Seniors go to their regular doctors (as long as the doctors agree to accept Medicare), and Medicare picks up the bills. The billing system is called fee-for-service, which means that doctors bill for every service they provide.Anyone who is eligible for Medicare can choose to sign up for Medicare Advantage, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. Some people prefer Medicare Advantage plans, though, because of convenience or because some plans offer extra benefits, such as additional coverage or even cash back through rebates on co-pays. About 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries choose a Medicare Advantage plan.Medicare Advantage includes several types of programs, everything from HMOs to PPOs to traditional fee-for-service plans. The details of each plan tend to differ depending on geographic location. All this diversity means it's hard to talk about one set of outcomes for Medicare Advantage.We asked the White House what evidence it had to show that ""Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy"" as Medicare Advantage. Staffers pointed us to a March 2009 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, an independent congressional agency that advises Congress on Medicare policy.We read MedPAC's report, and it seemed pretty down on Medicare Advantage, primarily because of its expense.""Paying a plan more than the cost for delivering the same services under the FFS (fee-for-service) system is not an efficient use of Medicare funds, particularly in the absence of evidence that such extra payments result in better quality compared to FFS,"" the report said.But the report also noted how difficult it is to compare Medicare Advantage with traditional Medicare.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 12, 2021 in a Facebook postInsulin prices rose “with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen.”By Bill McCarthy • February 25, 2021The indicators of quality ""differ greatly among plans and across plan types in MA (Medicare Advantage), and we currently do not have a basis for comparing plan performance with the quality of care in FFS Medicare.""MedPac said it plans to study the topic and issue a report in March 2010 under a mandate from Congress.MedPac was able to report, however, that Medicare Advantage HMOs, especially established HMOs, tend to have better outcomes than other Medicare Advantage plans.Additionally, a report from America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said that Medicare Advantage HMOs in California and Nevada reduced hospital days and readmissions compared with traditional Medicare.But HMO plans are not the areas of Medicare Advantage that are growing the most.""While payment policy in the MA program has led to growth in the number of plans available, growth in access to plans across the country, and increased enrollment, the additional funding has not necessarily resulted in cost containment or better quality of care for enrollees,"" MedPac concluded. ""Much of the enrollment growth is in new plans, which are not showing improvement in quality.""MedPAC is an independent agency, but we wondered if there was any other research on the topic.We checked with two independent policy experts on Medicare — Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund and Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research — and they both said the information was limited.""There's not a lot of good data to compare, so there's not really good evidence to say one way or another,"" Guterman said of Medicare versus Medicare Advantage. ""All the plans have to provide the same benefit package that traditional Medicare provides.""Moon said that while Medicare Advantage is open to everyone, there is evidence that the oldest and sickest beneficiaries tend to stay in traditional Medicare, probably because they are more change-averse. So it's possible that Medicare Advantage is paid more to take care of healthier seniors.""That bothers me considerably,"" Moon said.We also reviewed consumer advice on Medicare plans. Most of the advice says that individuals should research and select their plans carefully based on their own health conditions and preferences. We didn't see any advice that drew broad conclusions about which was better, Medicare or Medicare Advantage.Finally, the White House sent us a statement emphasizing the president's point and renewing his promise to curtail extra payments to Medicare Advantage.""There is no evidence that this extra payment leads to better quality for Medicare beneficiaries,"" said White House spokeswoman Katherine Bedingfield. ""Insurers, not beneficiaries or the Medicare program, determine how these overpayments are used — and this includes marketing and other administrative costs. This means that seniors do not always get the full overpayments back in the form of extra benefits. Additionally, some plans offer lower cost-sharing for drugs and vision care but higher cost-sharing for services such as hospitalizations and home health services. As a result, seniors can end up spending more out of pocket under a Medicare Advantage plan, not less.     ""Reducing these Medicare overpayments will affirm President Obama’s promise to strengthen the Medicare program, extend its solvency and reduce premiums for all beneficiaries.""President Obama said, ""Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy"" as Medicare Advantage. We found little statistical evidence that would definitively confirm or refute this. MedPAC, the independent agency that reports to Congress, said it had no reason to think that Medicare Advantage overall was superior to regular Medicare. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty that merits further study.

By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021It may make sense and save lives, but does it save money? Experts say no.The head of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number-crunching for Congress, has said this isn't the case, despite claims from many Democrats to the contrary.     ""The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate.      Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive:     ""But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. . . Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it.""     In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on.   The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in bills being considered in the House of Representatives because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care.   ""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"" according to the paper. ""Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.""   And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, ""as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs.""   So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it won't reduce government spending on health care.

Orrin Hatch made the argument that the American health care system works well for most people.""You know, why would we throw out a system that 85 percent of Americans have and basically approve of and exchange it for 47 million people?"" asked Hatch, a Republican from Utah, referring to a frequently cited estimate of the number of uninsured in the United States.""By the way, of that 47 million people, when you deduct the ones who could have insurance through their employers but don't, you deduct the 11 million that basically qualify for CHIP or Medicaid but don't realize it (and) are not enrolled, you deduct those who are over $75,000 a year in income but just won't purchase their own health insurance, and then 6 million people who are illegal aliens, my gosh, when you put that all together, it leaves about 15 million people. So we're going to throw out a system that works for 15 million people.""We were interested in analyzing Hatch's numbers for accuracy. When you subtract out all those groups, do you end up with only 15 million people?The basis for Hatch's statement is a chart created by the Republican Policy Committee, his staff told us. Hatch handles things a little differently from the chart: He adds 1 million to the number who qualify for Medicaid and SCHIP, and he doesn't mention legal immigrants, the way the chart does. But the numbers as he uses them add up.But let's take a closer look at the chart to see how it arrived at its conclusion.We asked the Republican Policy Committee for its supporting materials, and a lot of it is based on data from the U.S. Census, which conducts annual, large-scale surveys on income, poverty and health insurance coverage. Other data is based on research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source for nonpartisan information on health care policy.But the way the data is used raises questions. The biggest problem is that there's almost certainly some overlap between the different groups. How much overlap? Unfortunately, there's no way to tell.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021For clarity's sake, we're going review the different data points.The Republican analysis uses data from 2006, which is a year earlier than the most recent data. That year, the census found that 47 million were uninsured and that 10.2 million of them were noncitizens. Estimates from reputable sources indicate that roughly 6 million of those are illegal immigrants. So far, so good. (We examined Census data onthe uninsured and estimates for illegal immigrantsin a previous item, if you'd like to read a more in-depth analysis of this point.)The next number on the chart is households that earn more than $75,000 a year. Keep in mind this number represents household income, so it counts people who live in roomate situations, too, for example. But the number is right: The census does show that 9.3 million uninsured people live in households with income more than $75,000 a year.The next two categories come from outside the census, from research published by the Kaiser Foundation. The chart says that 10 million people are eligible for a government program like Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Fund, known as SCHIP or just CHIP. And it says 6 million people could get insurance through their employers but choose not to. The numbers are roughly correct, but these analyses were based on 2004 data, not the 2006 data.If you subtract each group separately from the total of 47 million, you get to 12 million. The chart seems to account for that, by saying it's 12 to 15 million who are insured. But there's no way to know if 3 million is a proper way to account for people who fall into multiple categories.Take for example a legal immigrant who comes to the United States to work at a high-paying job. News reports have mentioned that many of these immigrants are young people who come to work in the technology sector or the financial industry. A person like that who chose not to buy insurance through an employer would be subtracted three times here: Once as a legal immigrant, once as someone making more than $75,000 and once as someone who declined to get employer insurance.As another example, generally speaking, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal benefit programs. But there are exceptions. Some state governments have chosen to cover illegal immigrants, especially children, through programs affiliated with Medicaid and CHIP. So there may be duplication between the category of illegal immigrants and people eligible for Medicaid and/or CHIP. How many people? We don't know, and we couldn't find any analysis that could answer that question.The $75,000 number also poses questions. Remember, this is the total income for an entire household. We can envision scenarios where that number represents people living in the same household but each making a lower income, and they may not be able to afford insurance individually. But again it's hard to know.So we find that the individual numbers that Hatch uses are accurate or in the ballpark. Our concerns are with the methodology used to come up with his bottom line. It relies on a hodgepodge of different years and sources and leaves open the possibility that some people are double- or triple-counted. It would not pass muster in an undergraduate statistics class.

The official White House Twitter account has only about 830,000 as of last count. Is it time to replace the Electoral College with the Twitter count?""MCCAIN: ""It is a phenomenal way of communicating.""We checked the Twitter pages and found King is correct about those counts. McCain's page,  @SenJohnMcCain  (A recent tweet: ""Fighting to remove two more pork barrel projects totaling $24.5 million - we will probably lose, again, because it's business as usual in DC"") had 1,128,161 followers. The White House account,  @whitehouse  , had 860,835 (Recent tweet: ""Don't believe everything you see on the web about health insurance reform . . .

That one,  @barackobama  , had 1,902,667 followers. So add them together and Obama has nearly triple McCain's followers.One of King's producers correctly noted the caveat in an article on the CNN Web site, but King did not mention it during the interview.So King is correct with his claim that McCain beats the  official White House Twitter account,  but viewers might be misled to think that's the total count for Obama when in fact it's just one of his two accounts.

In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions.We decided to fact-check two ""questions"" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean.One is an allegation that the Obama administration has ordered a new initiative that requires FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield. We deal with that one inanother Truth-O-Meter ruling.Here, we address the GOP question, ""Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?""As you can see, built into the ""question"" is a statement of fact, that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza.During a trip to Egypt in early March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States intends to provide $900 million for humanitarian, economic and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.Here's how that money would be split: $200 million to the Palestinian Authority to address part of its 2009 budget shortfall; $400 million ""to help the Palestinian Authority solidify economic and institutional reforms in the West Bank""; and $300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza following January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas. The humanitarian aid to Gaza would be distributed primarily through U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The strategy, according to State Department officials, was to specifically make sure the money did not go to Hamas.In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 30, Clinton assured that disbursement of the money ""will be implemented with stringent requirements to prevent aid from being diverted into the wrong hands.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021Translation: Hamas.Some have argued, however, that the aid, while not going directly to Hamas, would still benefit them.""Whatever officials in Washington might intend, the Obama administration's new Gaza aid package is likely to turn out to be a financial boon for Hamas, which wields actual physical control over the places the aid is destined to go,"" wrote Ilan Berman, vice president for foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, in an April commentary distributed by Tribune Media Services.Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in U.S.-Middle East policy, said there are legitimate concerns about aid ending up in the hands of Hamas. The problem, he said, is that supposed nongovernmental groups that purport not to have ties with Hamas sometimes do.""We have yet to devise a foolproof system to ensure that money doesn't bleed out,"" Cook said.Still, he said, it's a wild distortion to claim that the United States has offered Hamas $900 million. First of all, most of the $900 million is going to the West Bank, not Gaza. And while some of the humanitarian aid disbursed through U.N. and other nongovernmental agencies could ""bleed out"" to Hamas unintentionally, that's far different from giving money directly to Hamas.Not only that, but the claim that the money would be used to ""rebuild"" Gaza after January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas is also misleading. The money to Gaza is for humanitarian aid — food, medicine, repairing damaged infrastructure, removing rubble, etc. It is specifically not for reconstruction, he said, as Israel was concerned that reconstruction money might be used to build tunnels, weapons factories or the like.""I'd give this one a D-minus,"" Cook said of the GOP claim.We agree that it's possible that even with safeguards, some of the humanitarian money could wind up in the hands of Hamas.But when you read the GOP survey, you are left with the impression that the U.S. government intends to write a big, fat $900 million check that says ""Pay to the order of Hamas."" To the contrary, Washington is taking steps to try to specifically make sure none of that money winds up in the hands of Hamas. We also note that only $300 million of the $900 million is even going to Gaza, for humanitarian aid. And the money is specifically not to be used for reconstruction. It is limited to humanitarian aid — food, medicine, that kind of thing. So the GOP is wrong on that point too. We rule the RNC's Hamas claim to be False.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/10/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-claims-obama-has-ordered-fbi-read-miranda-righ/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Foreign Policy,Terrorism,Republican National Committee",,,,,

The administration includes  a few caveats  about the data — names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example.

During the presidential campaign, Obama estimated his plan could cost $50 billion to $65 billion a year. That could come to $1 trillion over about 15 to 20 years. But independent sources that favor a health care overhaul put the expense much higher, at about $150 billion a year. That comes to $1.5 trillion over 10 years.Blunt says that ""Democrats have failed to answer the most basic question"" of how they want to pay for health care. But Obama has put forward some relatively concrete proposals. His current budget includes a $635 billion fund for health care that includes savings from greater efficiencies and changing the tax code so the wealthy don't get as much in deductions. It's not clear if Congress will go along with the tax changes, though, and analysts have questioned whether the savings will be as great as Obama says.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

Max Baucus of Montana of held a hearing on May 12, 2009, to discuss ways of financing health care, and senators during the hearing expressed a great deal of skepticism about new taxation strategies. After Blunt made his comments, Baucus put forward a policy paper that included several ways to potentially pay for health care, including modifying tax exemptions on employer-provided insurance and taxing alcohol and soda.Len Berman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who testified during the hearing, said later Congress seems unsure how it will pay for health care. He wrote in a blog post that they seemed to be in the grip of ""magical thinking.""""If there was the easy answer they'd have figured it out already,"" Berman told PolitiFact.

""Unfortunately, Washington Democrats have done nothing to address this savings crisis.  In fact, Washington is pursuing policies that are causing Americans’ savings to evaporate more quickly, and some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts.  That’s unacceptable and not the solution Americans need at a time when they want to rebuild their retirement, college, and personal savings.""So who are the ""some"" advocating such a dramatic overhaul of the American retirement savings system?According to a spokesman for Boehner, he's referring to a professor who spoke before the House Education and Labor Committee on Oct. 7.In a presentation on ""The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Workers' Retirement Security,"" Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economic policy at New York's New School for Social Research, said America's ""30-year experiment with 401(k) accounts has failed.""About half of workers will not have enough in retirement to replace 70 percent of their preretirement income, she said, which is largely caused by a ""fundamentally flawed"" 401(k) program that has little regulation. She recommended Congress end tax subsidies for 401(k) plans in favor of ""guaranteed retirement accounts"" into which workers would be required to contribute 5 percent of their pay. The government would guarantee a 3 percent inflation-indexed return. And Uncle Sam would contribute $600 per worker, every year to those accounts.Her idea doesn't have any significant support in Congress that we could find. About the closest to support that we heard was from George Miller, the California Democrat who chairs the committee. He is interested in some kind of major long-term reform to the retirement savings system, but has stopped short of calling for the elimination of the 401(k) system.Two months ago, his committee held a hearing on strengthening worker retirement security. In his opening statement, Miller said ""the current economic crisis has exposed deep flaws in our nation's retirement system. For too many Americans, 401(k) plans have become little more than a high-stakes crapshoot,"" Miller said.Miller did not discuss any specific changes, but over the long term, he said, we ""should ask ourselves whether our current system gives workers the ability to ensure a safe and secure retirement."" He emphasized the need to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s but also said the Congress must consider additional retirement options.""In the short term, Congress must address ways to improve defined contribution plans,"" Miller said. ""The 401(k) needs to be more transparent, fair, and operated on behalf of the account holder, not Wall Street firms. But, we must also ask the difficult questions about the state of our nation's retirement system as a whole and look to see whether we need to create a new leg of retirement security.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

Conservative blogs also criticized the possibility that 401(k) plans be replaced by a government-run savings plan.Miller fired back, accusing theWall Street Journalof misrepresenting his efforts and ""needlessly creating fear among Americans rightly worried about their retirement security.""  ""I do not support 'abolishing' 401(k)s, moving these plans, or changing their tax status, plain and simple,"" said Miller. ""The truth is that Democrats in Congress are working to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s.""Still, Miller's use of the phrase ""short term"" in February ""piqued the curiosity"" of Ed Ferrigno, vice president of Washington affairs for the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an association that represents employers that sponsor 401(k) plans.""He (Miller) made it clear that his support of 401(k)s is qualified,"" Ferrigno said. ""I don't know what to read into that. It certainly could create a foundation for a system to overtake 401(k) plans.""But there's been no support in Congress or the White House for the kind of wholesale change that Boehner mentioned, according to Ferrigno and our review of legislation and statements. To the contrary, Democrats have spoken of protecting 401(k)s.In a speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to enact rules to ""protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).""Yes, there are ""some"" in Washington who are tossing around the prospect of moving to a government-run system, and some of them may even want to scrap 401(k)s. But they are not elected officials and not in the Obama administration.Our problem with Boehner's statement is that it seems to suggest the idea has gained traction with Democratic lawmakers and administration officials. Use of the word ""some"" may provide Boehner some wiggle room here ? he could probably safely say that ""some"" people in Washington may be advocating darn near anything ? but the context suggests Democrats are behind it.We haven't found any, so Boehner's claim comes off sounding more like a scare tactic.

Yes, as a lawyer in private practice more than 15 years ago, Ogden once did legal work on behalf of Playboy, Penthouse and other adult businesses. Ogden was then a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jenner & Block, which had an active constitutional practice representing a number of media clients with First Amendment issues.In 1986, Ogden famously represented Playboy (as well as the American Council for the Blind, the American Library Association and others) when he successfully argued in federal court that the Library of Congress violated the First Amendment when it refused to fund publication of a Braille edition ofPlayboymagazine. The federal government pays to have many periodicals printed into Braille. Ogden was quoted in theWashington Postat the time hailing the decision as ""turning the tide in the censorship battle"" and saying that he hoped the printing of Braille editions ofPlayboy""is not an intolerable burden on the program"" but was ""the price of violating people's First Amendment rights.""Ogden also sought an injunction to prevent the Meese Commission (a commission on pornopgraphy) from includingPlayboyin a potential ""black list"" of adult magazines. And he represented a mail-order distributor of adult videos that challenged the constitutionality of a multidistrict prosecution strategy. The Fidelis Web site documents numerous other briefs Ogden filed in obscenity cases on behalf of Playboy, the ACLU, the Amerrican Booksellers Association and others.In a news release, Brian Burch, president of Fidelis, said, ""Ogden’s record is nothing short of obscene. He has represented Playboy Enterprises in multiple cases, Penthouse Magazine, the ACLU, and the largest distributor of hard-core pornography videos.  He has opposed filters on library computers protecting children from Internet smut, and successfully defended the right of pornographers to produce material with underage children.""David Ogden has collected checks from Playboy and Penthouse to fight reasonable protections for parents and children from pornography. Ogden even sued the federal government in an attempt to publish Braille versions of Playboy magazine – at taxpayer expense, of course.""During a hearing on Ogden's nomination on Feb. 5, 2009, several Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Ogden for nearly two hours about positions he took in some of those cases.Several asked Ogden about the Library of Congress case.""I was representing a client as a lawyer in private practice,"" Ogden explained. ""A lawyer in private practice does not sit in judgment of his clients. His job is to present their views as persuasively and appropriately as possible.""Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, challenged Ogden about arguments he once made against a law requiring producers of sexually explicit material to keep records about the identity and age of performers. ""How,"" Hatch asked, ""can we believe the Department of Justice will properly enforce this law, and if necessary defend its constitutionality when you have said for 20 years that it is unconstitutional?""Ogden said the courts have made it clear that the government has the power to require that records are kept, and he said, ""I think the law is constitutional as it stands today."" And he stressed that while he fought for constitutional issues in that case, it should not be interpreted that he believes obscene materials or child pornography should go unpunished or unregulated.""I want to make it very clear that the laws against child pornography are extremely important laws,"" Ogden said.  ""I think that child pornography is abhorrent. I think the efforts to exploit children is abhorrent and deserves the full sanctions of the law. And that is my strong view.""Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions noted that Ogden once argued against a congressional attempt to force librarians to put a filter on computers so that children could not view pornography. Sessions said he understood that lawyers advocate for their client's position, but he wanted to know what Ogden felt about that personally.""I think it's quite important that children be protected from exposure to materials that is obscene to them,"" Ogden responded. ""I think that's a different standard than what's obscene to adults. I think it's appropriate for parents to want to have protections with respect to those materials.""Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021Republican Sen. Jon Kyl called Ogden's attention to arguments he made against the conviction of a man found in possession of videos with girls in bikinis, or otherwise scantily clad, striking provocative poses and gyrating suggestively. A court later ruled the videos were clearly intended to pander to pedophiles. Ogden filed a brief on behalf of booksellers and library associations arguing that the videos did not constitute child pornography, that the standard ought to be nudity. They lost.Ogden said he'd have no problem enforcing the law, and that he would stand up for it if confirmed.""That was an argument made for a client,"" Ogden said. ""As the lawyer for the United States, I will aggressively and appropriately enforce the law of the U.S. to its full letter.""So that's a few highlights of Ogden's representation of the adult business.Supporters — many of them Republicans — say those cases are hardly career-defining for Ogden. Rather, they note that while head of the Department of Justice's civil division, Ogden was part of the team that defended the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996; and that he helped to defend the Child Online Protection Act of 1998.In the hearing on Feb. 5, Ogden said one of his proudest professional moments came from a brief he filed for the American Psychological Association arguing that child victims of sexual abuse sex ought to be allowed to testify via closed-circuit television due to the psychologically damaging effects of having to testify in person.For the last eight years, Ogden has worked for the law firm WilmerHale, where he is a partner and co-chair of the Government and Regulatory Litigation Practice Group. His clients include pharmaceutical, petrochemical, insurance, automotive, airline and media companies. For a more complete look at some of the work Ogden has done for WilmerHale, check outhis pageon the company Web site.Reginald Brown, a former Bush Administration official and current law partner of Ogden, said Ogden's work for adult businesses has been vastly overplayed. ""He took some positions on behalf of interest groups that obviously the government disagreed with,"" Brown said. ""It was by no means a majority of his practice. The bulk of his practice over the last eight years has been representing various companies — energy companies, pharmaceuticals and even some government agencies. I would describe it as a wide-ranging commercial litigation practice.""As for the work for Playboy, Penthouse and other distributors of adult videos, Brown said. ""The extent of that work is greatly exaggerated and is taken out of context. It's borderline libelous to suggest that David has a huge practice representing the pornography industry. That's not to say he didn't work on the cases cited.""Said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama administration: ""David Ogden is committed to fighting for families and children. That is why his nomination has been supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Boys and Girls Club of America, among others. While Ogden served at DOJ, he led the U.S. government’s defense of various antipornography statutes against constitutional attack, arguing forcefully against positions taken in some of those cases by former clients.  He will do so again as Deputy Attorney General.""We take LaBolt's point. And we think when some people hear Fidelis and others refer to Ogden as a ""porn lawyer"" they may assume that Ogden spent the better part of his career representing the pornography industry.

That week, they found that 34 percent of Obama’s ads were negative.But McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76 percent to 56 percent). In all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that 73 percent of McCain’s ads have been negative, to date. That's far short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama’s ads have been negative.)That’s up for both parties from the 2004 election, when 64 percent of George Bush’s ads were negative, compared to 34 percent of John Kerry’s.So Obama might be right for one week, but he is way off for the overall campaign, when McCain's negative ads accounted for 73 percent.

ACORN's agenda includes left-leaning causes such as voter registration drives for low-income groups, initiatives to increase the minimum wage and programs offering help to victims of predatory lending.By all indications, ACORN operates within the American political mainstream, though clearly it favors the left side of the ideological spectrum. Its voter registration efforts tend to focus on the low-income, minorities and youth, all traditional Democratic constituencies. Obama received an endorsement from the group's political action committee in February 2008 when the Democratic primaries were in full swing. But that's not to say Republicans never support ACORN's efforts: McCain himself appeared at a 2006 rally in favor of immigration reform, sponsored in part by ACORN.The primary allegation against ACORN is that its voter registration drives result in many phony registrations. ACORN itself admits that some of its workers, in their attempts to meet registration goals, have turned in registration forms for people who do not exist or don't live in the geographic area. (Notorious examples include Mickey Mouse and the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys.) ACORN says the problems are isolated, and that it works with officials to correct them. They claim to have registered 1.3-million people to vote, so a small number of irregularities are to be expected. (For more on ACORN and the controversy surrounding its voter registration drives,read the St. Petersburg Times story here.) Several states are investigating the group's voter registration efforts.The McCain campaign issued numerous charges about Obama's connection to ACORN in an Oct. 10, 2008, memo. For other charges, read our full story. Here, we'll look at the allegation that Obama was ""a trial attorney for ACORN.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021 Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoirDreams from my Father, and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work. Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN along with other plaintiffs in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois — Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named plaintiffs — to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as ""motor voter,"" which allowed people to register to vote when they got their driver's license. Among the groups who sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996.Obama was making his first successful run for the Illinois state Senate in 1996; he would hold that office until he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004. Obama remained affiliated with the law firm while he served in the state legislature, but news reports say his actual legal work for the firm declined significantly as he focused on his elected office.So if McCain campaign's statement means that Obama represented ACORN, this is true. But the statement implies that Obama worked for ACORN as a staff attorney, or in a longer-term relationship. Yet he really only represented them once. So we find McCain's statement Half True.","http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article852295.ece,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Candidate Biography,John McCain",,,,,
619,,,,false,,,,politifact,,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/oct/07/john-mccain/94-not-even-close/,"""Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.""",,politifact,,"As the presidential campaign heads into its final weeks, John McCain’s camp increasingly is portraying Barack Obama as a classic liberal who has never met a tax hike that he can’t support. McCain’s camp contends Obama’s addiction to taxes would further weaken the already staggering economy by placing new burdens on middle-class Americans and prompting U.S. corporations to shift more jobs overseas. This line of attack allows McCain and his proxies to point to the Arizona Republican’s lengthy record in Congress of opposing tax increases while supporting reduced federal spending.During the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., McCain made the charge directly.""Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.""Ninety-four times? Not that we could find. The tally more accurately demonstrates how easy it is to distort a candidate’s record by characterizing in broad strokes complicated bills and resolutions that contain myriad policy proposals. The 94-vote count first appeared in a June 9 Republican National Committee “tax backgrounder” that purported to document the tax increases Obama proposed or supported in the U.S. Senate and Illinois Legislature, when he served in the state Senate. The RNC didn’t respond to a request from PolitiFact to provide a breakdown of all 94 votes it says its research staff unearthed. It indicated the results were gleaned using the Library of Congress’ legislative search engine, Thomas (named for Thomas Jefferson andfound here). With the right query, it’s possible to get that result, but the GOP’s list is misleading for a number of reasons. First, it counts votes on Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation but don’t have the force of law. For example, the Republicans cite Obama’s votes in support of a fiscal 2009 budget resolution they say would raise taxes on individuals earning as little as $31,850. We’ve previously dealt with this claim and ruled itFalse. The document assumes that many of President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will be allowed to expire at the end of 2010, or that their cost will be offset by new sources of revenues. Republicans point to this as evidence that Democrats want to raise taxes. But the documents don’t have line items on tax proposals. And even if they did, they would amount to little more than political statements, because the documents cannot change tax law. So voting in favor of the resolution isn’t akin to voting to raise taxes. The budget resolutions do provide a perennial source of fodder for incendiary claims because while they’re largely symbolic, they prompt lengthy debates with numerous votes. Obama voted on 43 occasions with the majority of Democrats during various stages of debate on the 2009 budget resolution, including instances in which he helped defeat Republican proposals dealing with borrowing from the Social Security trust fund and erecting new procedural hurdles to any legislation that would raise income taxes. The 94-vote list also takes liberties characterizing which votes actually are “for higher taxes.” McCain’s folks count Obama’s opposition to extending lower tax rates for dividends and capital gains (at least nine votes), and his votes against exemptions to the Alternative Minimum Tax for middle-class taxpayers (at least five votes). These proposals were hallmarks of Republican efforts to extend a variety of popular tax breaks that were expiring when the GOP controlled Congress. Many Democrats, including Obama, opposed them as fiscally irresponsible and primarily benefitting the rich. But if voting against a tax cut is the same as voting for higher taxes, then it’s worth noting McCain’s rather well-documented record in this regard. In 2001, McCain antagonized conservatives when he voted against President Bush’s tax cuts, saying they needed to be paired up with equivalent cuts in spending. He voted against the 2003 round of cuts, too. We give McCain credit for adding the phrase ""or against tax cuts"" to Obama’s list of alleged misdeeds, because unlike the RNC tax backgrounder, this captures the essence of at least 20 of his documented votes.Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021However, McCain and the RNC both fail to note that some of the other votes would not have resulted in a net tax increase, but instead redistributed the burden among different payers. The 94-vote tally, for example, cites Obama’s support of higher taxes on the oil and gas industries. But some of those Democratic tax plans that would have eliminated a tax break for domestic production or imposed a “windfall profits” tax on the biggest oil companies would have applied the proceeds to wind energy, cellulosic ethanol, geothermal power and other emerging energy sources that produce less pollution than traditional sources. They also would have created a new incentive for consumers to buy plug-in hybrid cars and extend tax breaks for energy-efficient homes and businesses.The Obama campaign says the 94-vote figure is dishonest and misleading, and with a wink compiled its own list of McCain votes, using his camp’s methodology. The results: the Republican candidate voted for higher taxes 477 times since arriving in Congress in 1982, including 105 occasions since 2005. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden invoked the 477 figure during the vice presidential debate when Gov. Sarah Palin made the very same 94-vote charge. Biden said, “It’s a bogus standard.”We didn't track down all 477 votes the Democrats claimed, but we looked at a few and found that McCain, indeed, could be depicted as having voted to raise multiple taxes, just as Obama did, if one reads the fine print. For example, in May 2006, McCain voted for a massive fiscal 2006 tax and spending bill that, among other things, increased excise taxes on public charities and expanded the base of the tax on private foundation investment income. These revenue-raisers helped offset $70-billion in tax cuts, including reduced rates on capital gains and dividends and writeoffs for small businesses, according to a summary prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1997, McCain voted for a $100.4-billion, five-year tax cut package that, among other things, raised cigarette taxes 10 cents per pack in 2000 and 15 cents per pack in 2002.In the record, there are many instances in which Obama supported actual tax increases. We found more than 20 examples, such as an August 2007 vote on legislation to expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program that called for increasing the federal cigarette tax by 61 cents per pack, to $1. Obama also supported a plan enacted in June to pay for a new veterans’ education benefit by levying a new 0.5 percent surtax on individuals who make more than $500,000 or couples who make more than $1-million in adjusted gross income annually.But 94 still is awfully far away. The McCain campaign could easily claim that Obama has ""repeatedly"" supported higher taxes according to his record in the Senate. But by using such a precise number, the McCain campaign's charge carries a greater level of authority and credibility, which it really doesn't deserve. It's not merely that their count is wrong, but that they're misleading with their attempt at unsupported precision. We say False.","http://thomas.loc.gov/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/425/ ,/personalities/tom-wolf/,/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/",,"National,Taxes,John McCain",,,,,

""I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere,"" Palin said, echoing comments she made five days earlier when she was named John McCain's running mate.She was talking about a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge project that became the subject of national ridicule and a symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.The bridge was to connect the city of Ketchikan (population 8,200) to Gravina, an island with just 50 residents but also an airport, and only accessible by a five-minute ferry ride.The project came into national prominence when a government watchdog group tagged it as an extreme example of wasteful pork-barrel spending. Its national notoriety was cemented with aParademagazine cover story that ran Nov. 6, 2005, under the headline, ""Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?""The project also raised bitter debate in Congress, and several attempts were made to yank funding for the project. In the fall of 2005, Congress removed the language specifically directing the money to the bridge, but it kept the money in place and left it up to Alaska to decide which transportation projects the state would like to spend it on.By the time Palin pulled the plug on the Gravina bridge project in September 2007, much of the federal funding for the bridge had already been diverted to other transportation projects. The bridge would cost $398-million, Palin said then, and Alaska was $329-million short.""Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer,"" Palin said. ""Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island.""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

And had Palin decided to continue forward with the bridge project, she said, it would have required either a lot more federal funding - which there clearly was no support for - or for the state to pick up the bulk of the tab at the expense of other more urgent road projects.Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, the government watchdog that first drew attention to the project, believes Palin has ""hyperinflated her role"" in killing the project.""She put the final stake in the project,"" Ashdown said. ""But there was already tremendous momentum for the project to be scrapped. She gets credit for saying that they were not to go forward with the bridge, but it was at death's door.""(We'll also note that Palin wasn't always a foe of the Bridge to Nowhere. In our Flip-O-Meter ruling, we conclude that her decision to kill the bridge was aFull Flop from the position she had taken while running for governor.)Today, when Palin says ""I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere,"" it implies Congress said, ""Here's a check for that bridge"" and she responded, ""No thanks, that's wasteful spending; here's your money back.""That's not what happened. Fact is, Alaska took the bridge money, and then just spent it on other projects.

And, says he'll raise taxes on electricity.""Higher taxes, more foreign oil, that's the real Obama,"" the voice concludes.We know that Obamadoes not supportexpanded offshore drilling, because he says it won't do anything to reduce gas prices. But we were intrigued by the claim that Obama wants to raise taxes on electricity. That's not something we recalled from his policy proposals.In a prepared memo in support of the ad, the McCain campaign pointed to an interview Obama had with a Texas newspaper in February 2008.""What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas,"" Obama said in the interview. The McCain campaign argued that because coal and natural gas are major sources of electricity, Obama supports a tax on electricity.But the context of the interview (whichwe've looked at before) shows Obama was making a statement of principle rather than a policy proposal.In the interview withSan Antonio Express-Newscolumnist Carlos Guerra, Obama discussed funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, ""Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?""Featured Fact-checkTom Wolfstated on February 22, 2021 in a speech“We’re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax.”By Jessica Calefati • February 25, 2021Obama replied: ""Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts.""If you look at Obama's proposals, he does not advocate an electricity tax or a carbon tax, but instead proposes a cap-and-trade system. A campaign spokesman said that was what Obama was talking about in the interview.The idea behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon industries can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively.Cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of energy for some consumers if companies have to buy additional permits for emissions, but they are not usually considered a tax. McCain, incidentally, also supports a cap-and-trade system.""It wouldn't officially be considered a tax,"" said Eric Toder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""The proposal for a cap-and-trade system would raise prices for some people, but both candidates support cap-and-trade.""Yes, Obama did use the word ""tax"" in the interview, but he was reacting to a question about taxing clean energy and making the point that producers of clean energy should not be given a disincentive. And he concluded that energy taxes should not be used to fund education.The McCain ad says that Obama ""says he'll raise taxes on electricity"" and points to a line from one interview that requires a lot of explanation. Obama's proposals don't say anything about a tax on electricity. Is Obama open to the idea of taxing dirty energy? Arguably yes. But that's some distance from saying he wants to tax electricity.

Instead, the show, which aired seven months after the initial invasion, focused on the costs of rebuilding Iraq. Koppel's report was skeptical of a claim from a Bush administration official that U.S. taxpayers would only be on the hook for $1.7 billion in reconstruction costs. (He was right to be suspicious; a 2007 GAO estimate put the reconstruction price tag at $40 billion and counting). Koppel interviewed McCain for his views on rebuilding costs, and even then McCain disputed the Bush administration claim.Here's a fuller excerpt from the interview:McCain: ""I think there (were) many of us, in fact, most of us that believed that the military part would be the easy part. And reconstruction and rebuilding Iraq would be the hard part. But I have to also tell you, we did not realize the state of total deterioration of the Iraqi infrastructure. We didn't appreciate how much Saddam Hussein had let everything go to hell. I knew it was going to be very tough. I didn't know until I went over there how much it was going to be. And may I say, it's going to be a lot more than $20 billion before we're through.""Koppel: ""Do you have a sense of how much more?""McCain: ""Estimates I hear as much as $50 to $55 billion more.""Koppel: ""Over a course of how many years?""McCain: ""Four or five years.""Koppel never addresses the question of troops, deployments or withdrawal in this interview.We looked for other McCain statements at this time, and found that in most cases he was actually urging the Bush administration to send more troops to Iraq to maintain order and security there. A few weeks before his interview with Koppel, a reporter on CNN asked him how long troops would have to be in Iraq to secure a true victory. McCain replied: ""I don't know, because I don't know how quickly we're going to act in the form of sending troops. I don't know how quickly we're going to be able to provide them with the security. So, it's sort of up to us.""•From MSNBC's ""Hardball,"" Feb. 25, 2004:McCain: ""Listen, my friend, we're going to be there for five or six years.""This exchange more fairly represents McCain's views, though his remarks aren't strictly about deployments. He seems to be more talking about how long troops will have to actively maintain order to help a newly formed government establish itself. After discussing that prospect, host Chris Matthews asked, ""What's the role of the U.S. military once we get a government out there?""McCain: ""We'll still be there for security purposes.

A little straight talk: We're going to have to be there for quite a while.""Matthews: ""And we have to defend the government?""McCain: ""We will try to maintain security. There's just too many bad elements both from outside and from within.""•From CBS News' ""The Early Show,"" Feb. 3, 2005:McCain: ""If I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half...""Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021In this interview, Hannah Storm asks John McCain specifically about a withdrawal timetable. This snippet appears to be a fair presentation of McCain's views. Here's the fuller exchange:Storm: ""What is a realistic timetable here? When would you like to see our troops leave?""McCain: ""Tomorrow. But I think that if I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half. But hopefully before then we could have our troops out of a lot of the areas where they're vulnerable to casualties. And the Iraqi American-trained law enforcement--their armed forces with U.S. troops embedded in them -- could take over much more of the responsibilities. That will reduce the casualty levels. Let me just remind you, Hannah, we're got troops in Bosnia; we've got them in Kosovo; we've been in South Korea for 50 years. Americans are not upset about that. They're upset when young Americans are wounded and killed.""Storm: ""So you're saying our troops could potentially be there for decades then, Senator?""McCain: ""I don't think decades because I don't think that the Iraqis want American troops staying, but I think we'll be there for a while and the Iraqi government appreciates that as well.""•From NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" June 19, 2005.McCain: ""I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now.""The questioning in this interview was about the training of Iraqi forces, not troop withdrawal. The time frame McCain mentions is when Iraqi troops will be fully trained, thought it's fair to say that the readiness of Iraqi troops is a pre-condition for U.S. withdrawal. Here's the full exchange between McCain and moderator Tim Russert.Russert: ""Our only exit strategy is to have enough Iraqis who are willing to defend their country, spill their own blood, so that we can withdraw. How many security forces do you believe the Iraqis have right now that are fully capable of fighting and defending their nation?""McCain: ""I don't know the answer. I know the number is increasing. … But I believe that there has been some improvement, and that improvement gives us, at least, some hope. Because, as you say, and everybody knows, the exit strategy from Iraq is not a time or a date. The exit strategy from Iraq is clearly the Iraqis being able to take over the responsibilities and the casualties, for policing and ensuring security in their own country. Look, nobody cares--in fact, I'm kind of glad that American troops are in South Korea. Why? Because there's no Americans in combat. So it's not a matter of time and date of withdrawal. It's a matter of Iraqis being able to assume the responsibilities for the security of their own nation. And, again, I think we should tell people it's not going to be a short--I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now, than say, 'Everything's fine,' and then be disappointed a year or two from now.""•From a town hall meeting in Concord, N.H., Jan. 3, 2008:Question: President Bush is talking about our staying in Iraq for 50 year...""McCain: ""Maybe a hundred.""We've looked at this claim previously; McCain's opponents have hammered him before for this statement, but its clear from the context that McCain is not urging a 100-year war. Rather, once combat ends and there are no more U.S. casualties, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Japan. That presence could continue for many years, according to McCain.Here's the full exchange McCain had with a voter at a town hall meeting:Question: ""President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — ""McCain: ""Maybe a hundred.""Question: ""Is that — ""McCain: ""We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day.""•From a McCain speech on May 15, 2008:McCain: ""By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly.""This appears to be a fair representation of McCain's views; it comes from a major policy speech he gave on what he hopes to accomplish during a first term. Here's a longer excerpt on the portion of his speech about Iraq:""By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom. The Iraq War has been won. Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension. Violence still occurs, but it is spasmodic and much reduced. Civil war has been prevented; militias disbanded; the Iraqi Security Force is professional and competent; al Qaeda in Iraq has been defeated; and the Government of Iraq is capable of imposing its authority in every province of Iraq and defending the integrity of its borders. The United States maintains a military presence there, but a much smaller one, and it does not play a direct combat role.""•From NBC News' ""Today Show,"" June 11, 2008:Question: ""Do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq?""McCain: ""No, but that's not too important.""This is edited to seem like McCain doesn't care about when troops come home. But judging from what McCain said next, he meant it wasn't too important if troops were in Iraq as long as the fighting was over and there were few casualties. Here's McCain's complete answer:""No. But that's not too important. What's important is the casualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea, Americans are in Japan, American troops are in Germany. That's all fine. American casualties and the ability to withdraw. We will be able to withdraw. General Petraeus is going to tell us in July when he thinks we are. But the key to it is we don't want any more Americans in harm's way. And that way they will be safe and serve our country, and come home with honor and victory, not in defeat, which is what Senator Obama's proposal would have done. And I'm proud of them and they're doing a great job, and we are succeeding. And it's fascinating that Senator Obama still doesn't realize that.""So while the DNC ad gets some of its points accurate, it purposefully edits McCain's remarks to distort them in at least three instances (the Nightline interview, the ""100 years"" remark and the ""not too important remark""). Two of the instances (the ""Hardball"" interview and the ""Meet the Press"" interview) are borderline; his comments address issues that affect withdrawal but aren't precisely on point. Two instances (""The Early Show"" interview and McCain's speech) are fair and accurate representations of his views.While the ad is right on two items, and partially right on two items, three of the quotes are out of context and distort McCain's original meaning. This weakens the DNC's case against McCain significantly. We rate the DNC's argument that McCain has given inconsistent and erratic answers on when troops should return from Iraq Barely True.Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eejYoz3Nl0,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Iraq,Democratic National Committee",,,,,

""You're going to be paying them interest for generations to come -- that makes us weaker.""Obama's correct in his implication that the U.S. is borrowing money to fund the war, because the U.S. government is running budget deficits, meaning the government is spending more money than it brings in through taxes and fees.Of course, the government cannot just print extra paper money when it needs to spend or it would devalue U.S. currency. Instead, it issues, or more precisely sells, U.S. Treasury securities, which are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

China is number two, the United Kingdom is number three, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is number four.So, here's the problem with Obama's argument. And with McCain's. And with Clinton's, while we're at it. All have made similar statements. The bonds the government sells are not program-specific so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government.Obama could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for the war, and that would have been just as true as what he did say.So Obama is correct in his point that the government is spending borrowed money, and that some of our lenders include China and Saudi Arabia. But the lenders also include countries that we think of as friends and allies. By naming only lending nations that might alarm voters, Obama is distorting the picture somewhat.

John McCain fleshed out details of his health care plan in Tampa on April 29, 2008, opponents of his proposal were lining up to poke holes in the ideas of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.One criticism: McCain is willing to spend billions on the war in Iraq but not to help cover the 47-million Americans who don't have health insurance.McCain's plan takes a free-market approach to health insurance and avoids the government involvement proposed by his Democratic rivals. Among other things, McCain has suggested offering a $2,500 tax credit to individuals and a $5,000 credit to families to help pay for health insurance independent of their employers and setting up a nonprofit to negotiate health insurance for people denied coverage by private companies.The plan shows McCain's mixed-up priorities, contends Bill Newton, executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network.""For what we spend in just one week in Iraq, 800,000 children could get health insurance for an entire year,"" Newton said to highlight McCain's support of the war and his record of voting against expanding federal funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program.He made the statement April 29 at a news conference co-hosted by FCAN, Moveon.org and health care workers in the same hotel where McCain was attending a fundraiser.Newton's point is accurate, but his numbers are significantly understated. In fact, one week of war spending in Iraq would insure more than twice as many children.To check the claim, we looked at the cost of the war in Iraq versus how much Medicaid spends to insure one child for a year.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021The Bush administration war chest request for 2008 was $196-billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.That amounts to $3-billion a week.According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid payments in 2005 were about $1,617 per child.So $3-billion would actually insure about 1.9-million children a year.Newton said he got his figure from a federal budget trade-off calculator on the National Priorities Project Web site. A spokeswoman for National Priorities said the organization put the annual cost of insuring a child at about $1,800, based on costs in 2000 and forecasting for 2005. The calculator estimates the weekly war funding would insure about 1.1-million children based on spending in 2007. The calculator doesn't offer a figure for total proposed 2008 funding.The most current figures only make Newton's case stronger.When ruling on claims where numbers are overestimated, PolitiFact often gives the benefit of the doubt.

He was sworn into the Senate on a Koran, not the Bible (  Pants on Fire wrong.)  His middle name is Mohammed and he's a ""covert"" Muslim (  Pants on Fire wrong.) But those allegations are dwarfed by a new chain e-mail that distorts the words of the Bible to suggest Obama is the Antichrist.The e-mail reads: ""According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal....the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, will destroy everything is it OBAMA??""Like many other e-mails spreading falsehoods about the presidential candidates to thousands or even millions of people, this e-mail encourages its readers to pass it on: ""I STRONGLY URGE each one of you to repost this as many times as you can! Each opportunity that you have to send it to a friend or media outlet...do it! If you think I am crazy..Im sorry but I refuse to take a chance on the ""unknown"" candidate.""We feel silly even writing about this because many people consider it ridiculous on its face. But the e-mail was sent to us by many PolitiFact readers who wanted us to sort it out. And judging by 635,000 hits on a Google search for ""Obama + Antichrist,"" the suggestion certainly has spread. Among the thousands of postings is one blog —  ""Barack Obama the Antichrist?""  — devoted to exploring signs that Obama may be the Antichrist.And it's because of chain e-mails like this one that misunderstandings begin.To be clear: Nothing about this detailed allegation is true.Let's begin with the Book of Revelation (note the singular, which is accurate), the final book in the Bible's New Testament, which is 22 chapters long. Its sweeping apocalyptic language is laced with metaphors and symbols that challenge modern readers, but nowhere does it offer the kind of cookbook definition of the Antichrist proposed in this e-mail.To reach our findings, we read the Book of Revelation and interviewed two religious scholars. Here's what we found:• The word ""anti-christ"" does not appear in the Book of Revelation. ""The word Antichrist is not used in the Book of Revelation so this is important to point out,"" said Dr. James D. Tabor, professor and chair of the religious studies department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ""Everybody thinks the word is used.""That's a pretty big hole in this e-mail from the get-go. We didn't find the word in reading the text and our second scholar confirms this critical point.""First and foremost, the word Antichrist and a figure called the Antichrist never occurs in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament,"" said Dr. L. Michael White, professor of classics and religious studies at the University of Texas and director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins.Now, some people interpret characters in the Book of Revelation to be the Antichrist even though the text doesn't use this word. Specifically, in Chapter 13 there is a beast ""having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy"" that some consider to be an allusion to the Antichrist.""It's only in Chapter 13 and you could almost miss it,"" Tabor said.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y. Kim • February 1, 2021But among biblical scholars and historians, there is strong consensus that none of the strange, evil-sounding characters in the Book of Revelation actually represents the Antichrist.""It wasn't there in the Bible,"" White said. ""It emerges in the Middle Ages. It's something historians deal with.""Now the word Antichrist does appear a few times in other books of the Bible, specifically in First John and Second John. The description in First John, Chapter 4, verse 3 says: ""And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that  spirit  of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.""• There's no mention of a man of a certain age. The Book of Revelation talks of God, Jesus Christ, John, spirits, Jezebel, a beast like a calf, a beast like a flying eagle, elders, a great red dragon and many more animals and people. But nowhere does it describe ""a man, in his 40s,"" as the e-mail alleges.""As you notice, there's nothing about being age 40,"" Tabor said. ""This is completely wrong. The Book of Revelation doesn't say that. It says it's a male, so I guess they got that right. It says 'he,' 'he,' 'he.' ""• There's no mention of the word ""Muslim."" Considering the Bible was completed by the early second century, and the Islam religion wasn't founded until the early 600s, it's not surprising that the world Muslim (the name for Islam followers) does not appear in the Book of Revelation.So it's this part of the e-mail, where it says the Antichrist will be a man ""of Muslim descent,"" that our religious scholars find particularly ridiculous.By definition, the Antichrist is ""the polar opposite and ultimate enemy of Christ,"" according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. And because Muslims believe ""there is no god but God,"" they would have great difficulty with the idea of elevating a person to a divine status, White said.""A Muslim would be a monotheist and the last thing a Muslim would do is have anyone worship anyone other than God,"" Tabor said.Not to mention the fact that Obama is not a Muslim.White points to the specific descriptions of the Antichrist as evidence that the e-mail is drawing from a number of sources to create the image it wants to portray.""There is no part of that anywhere in the Bible, not in those forms,"" said White, who was a co-writer and historical consultant for the 1999 PBS documentary,  Apocalypse! Time, History, and Revolution.  ""That's all a jigsaw puzzle of bits and pieces all filtered through the kind of end-of-world scenarios we get in the theology that is the underpinning of the  Left Behind  novels.""White says this patchwork interpretation of the Bible is common in some groups trying to justify certain beliefs.""Of course, they never bothered to read the Scriptures carefully ... so it's kind of a system of interpretation. That if you start with that presupposition. ... it's all there you can just find it,"" White said.""That description (in the chain e-mail) never occurs anywhere in one place nor are the component parts really about the same situation. It's a cherry-picking through Scripture to get it all to fit together.""But fit together it doesn't. The claim in this e-mail is egregiously inaccurate, so we rule it Pants on Fire wrong.","https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/169/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/238/,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/281/,https://www.barackobamaantichrist.blogspot.com/,/personalities/ryan-fournier/,/factchecks/2021/feb/01/ryan-fournier/biden-administration-didnt-lose-20-million-covid-1/",,"National,Obama Birth Certificate,Religion,Chain email",,,,,

If premiums don't drop enough after all his reforms are implemented, people would still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't, he contends.We won't go into all the details of Obama's plan, but it includes several elements that apply to adults:• It would expand Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage for the poor.• It would provide income-related subsidies to help people who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need financial help to buy coverage.• It would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, or contribute to the cost of the insurance.If Clinton had said that Obama's plan ""does not mandate insurance for adults,"" she would have been on solid ground.

Attacked early on for raising taxes more than he cut them, Huckabee began laying the tax increases off on others. There was, for example, that matter of the 3-cent increase in the gas tax in Arkansas in 1999 accompanied by a 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which is paid mostly by truckers.""You know what we did?"" he said to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Feb. 11, 2007. ""We put it on the ballot, and 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for the fuel taxes because they wanted better roads.""The voters voted all right – but not on the taxes. Instead, voters approved (by 80 percent) a $575-million bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds. The diesel tax and the gasoline tax were going to take effect regardless of how the public voted.The Arkansas legislature had approved those taxes on April 1, 1999, and the first penny of the gas tax and the first 2 cents of diesel tax were already in effect on June 15, when voters went to the polls that year. (The gas tax rose by a penny each of the next two years, the diesel tax by 2 cents the next year.)The taxes and the bonds were a package plan, and Huckabee was its strong advocate. The plan to sell bonds was in Act 1027, approved by the legislature the same day as the gas tax in Act 1028.Huckabee would be fully justified in arguing that the vote reflected support for the taxes that supported the plan to issue bonds.In fact, he could even argue that the voters were approving the massive additional spending on roads. If the federal grants and diesel tax weren't enough to repay the bonds, the ""full faith and credit"" of the state stood behind them. As matter of fact, the gas tax wasn't directly pledged at all.But you could also argue the voters had nothing to lose. Their gas tax was going up whether they approved the bonds or not. The bonds made the road-building happen much faster.Featured Fact-checkCharlie Kirkstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'""By Daniel Funke • January 28, 2021For Huckabee and an overwhelming majority of legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, the need was clear. That year, and again in 2000, professional truck drivers surveyed byOverdrivemagazine rated Interstate 40 across Arkansas, between Memphis on the eastern border and Fort Smith on the Oklahoma border, the worst highway in the country. The Arkansas portion of I-30, which runs between Dallas and Little Rock, ranked fifth worst. TheOverdriveannual survey also identified Arkansas highways as the worst overall.The success of the plan is now also clear. By 2005, I-40 in Arkansas was the nation's ""most improved highway"" in theOverdrivesurvey, and I-30 was in the top five in that category.""When we put that out there for the people to decide whether they wanted to affirm it, they did by an 80 percent vote,"" Huckabee said on Fox News'Hannity & Colmeson Nov. 15, 2007. ""I'd call that leadership.""We'd also call that accurate – because of the phrase ""affirm it,"" which is closer to what voters actually did on the matter. So, does Huckabee's ""affirm"" language fix his claim as well as he fixed his roads? Alas, the myth of the approved tax continued.On Dec. 30, 2007, on NBC'sMeet the Press, Huckabee responded to rival Mitt Romney's attacks on his tax record. ""He made claims about things like tax increases,"" Huckabee said, ""but he failed to mention that some of those were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads.""(The ""court-ordered"" part, which refers to a $400-million increase in the sales tax for education after the Arkansas Supreme Court threw out the state's school-financing system, is also passing the buck. The court ordered a new funding system, arguably even required more spending, but didn't order any tax increase. But that's another Truth-o-Meter.)So how do we evaluate this ""voter approval"" claim?

In 1998, his grade was 87. In 1996, he scored 86 percent.But Thompson wasn't losing points for his position on so-called life issues. Rather, he was penalized mainly for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that limited how much outside interest groups could give to political parties, and when they could advertise during election campaigns. Many advocacy groups, including National Right to Life, opposed these bills on grounds that they would thwart their influence on Capitol Hill.On issues dearest to the antiabortion movement -- abortion rights, fetal tissue research, cloning, euthanasia and the like -- Thompson was solidly with them. In fact, his staunch opposition to those practices helped earn him the endorsement this month from the National Right to Life Committee, which boasts 3,000 chapters in 50 states.His record includes a vote against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion, and he consistently voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the mother -- not her health - is at stake. He voted to ban abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

""He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid.""As for Huckabee's claim that Thompson doesn't support a constitutional amendment banning abortion nationwide, that's true. Thompson has consistently opposed such an amendment. He has said he would like the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, but that each state should then be able to decide whether to allow abortion.Consider this exchange on the Nov. 4 edition of NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert:Thompson: I think people ought to be free at state and local levels to make decisions that even Fred Thompson disagrees with. That's what freedom is all about. And I think the diversity we have among the states, the system of federalism we have where power is divided between the state and the federal government is, is, is—serves us very, very well. I think that's true of abortion. I think Roe v. Wade hopefully one day will be overturned, and we can go back to the pre-Roe v. Wade days. But...Russert: Each state would make their own abortion laws?Thompson: Yeah. But ... to have an amendment compelling — going back even further than pre-Roe v. Wade, to have a constitutional amendment to do that, I do not think would be the way to go.We find Huckabee's claim about Thompson's antiabortion bona fides to be Half-True.

He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military.But even in 1994, he clearly opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, telling the Bay Windows newspaper that he backed the current governor's position that the law should only uphold male-female marriages.Featured Fact-checkRyan Fournierstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet“The Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.”By Noah Y.

As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary.""Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed.And so we give Romney a Half-True.

But analysts dispute to what extent these changes can be attributed to the border fence.Hunter is correct that smuggling along the San Diego-Tijuana corridor dramatically decreased when the fence started to go up.
